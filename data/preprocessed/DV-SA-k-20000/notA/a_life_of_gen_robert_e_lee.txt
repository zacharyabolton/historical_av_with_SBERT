the name of lee is beloved and respected throughout the world men of all parties and opinions unite in this sentiment not only those who thought and fought with him but those most violently opposed to his political views and career it is natural that his own people should love and honor him as their great leader and defender in a struggle of intense * his old enemies should share this profound regard and admiration is due solely to the character of the individual his military genius will always be conceded and his figure remain a conspicuous landmark in history but this does not account for the fact that his very enemies love the man his private character is the origin of this sentiment the people of the north no less than the people of the south feel that lee was truly great and the * critic has been able to find nothing to detract from this view of him the soldier was great but the man himself was greater no one was ever * truer or more honest those who knew him best loved him the most reserved and silent with a bearing of almost austere dignity he impressed many persons as cold and unsympathetic and his true character was long in revealing itself to the world today all men know what his friends knew during his * under the grave exterior of the soldier oppressed with care and anxiety beat a warm and kindly heart full of an even extraordinary gentleness and sweetness that the man himself was not cold or stiff or harsh but patient forbearing charitable under many trials of his equanimity and magnanimous without effort from the native impulse of his heart friend and foe thus today regard him with much the same sentiment as a genuinely honest man incapable of duplicity in thought or deed wholly good and sincere inspired always under all temptations by that * * which * and * and resolutely bent in the dark hour as in the bright on the full performance of his duty duty is the sublimest word in our language he wrote to his son and if we add that other august maxim human virtue should be equal to human calamity we shall have in a few words a summary of the principles which inspired lee the crowning grace of this man who was thus not only great but good was the humility and trust in god which lay at the foundation of his character upon this point we shall quote the words of a gentleman of commanding intellect a bitter opponent of the south in the war lee is worthy of all praise as a man he was fearless among men as a soldier he had no superior and no equal in the course of nature my career on earth may soon terminate god grant that when the day of my death shall come i may look up to heaven with that confidence and faith which the life and character of robert e lee gave him he died trusting in god as a good man with a good life and a pure conscience he had lived as he died with this supreme trust in an overruling and merciful providence and this sentiment pervading his whole being was the origin of that august calmness with which he greeted the most crushing disasters of his military career his faith and humble trust sustained him after the war when the woes of the south wellnigh broke his great spirit and he calmly expired as a weary child falls asleep knowing that its father is near of this eminent soldier and man whose character offers so great an example a memoir is attempted in this volume the work will necessarily be popular rather than full and elaborate as the public and private correspondence of lee are not at this time accessible these will throw a fuller light on the subject but sufficient material is at the disposal of the writer to enable him to present an accurate likeness of lee and to narrate clearly the incidents of his career in doing so the aim of the author is to measure out full justice to * to arouse old enmities which should be allowed to slumber but to treat his subject with the judicial moderation of the student of history a few words will terminate this preface the volume before the reader was begun in 1866 the writer first however informed general lee of his design and had the honor to receive from him in reply the assurance that the work would not interfere with any he might have in contemplation he had not written a line of any work as yet and might never do so but should he write a history of the campaigns of the army of northern virginia the proposed work would be rather an assistance than a * as the writer had offered promptly to discontinue the work if it were not agreeable to general lee this reply was regarded in the light of an assurance that he did not disapprove of it the composition was however interrupted and the work laid aside it is now resumed and completed at a time when the death of the illustrious soldier adds a new and absorbing interest to whatever is connected with his character or career the lees of virginia spring from an ancient and respectable family of essex in england of some members of the family both in the old world and the new a brief account will be given the origin of an individual explains much that is striking and peculiar in his own character and it will be found that general lee inherited many of the traits of his ancestors especially of some eminent personages of his name in virginia the family pedigree is traced back by lee in the life of his father to * lee of london in france who accompanied william the conqueror to england after the battle of * which subjected england to the sway of the * * lee like others was rewarded by lands wrested from the subdued * his estate lay in essex and this is all that is known concerning him * lee is the next member of the family of whom mention is made he lived during the reign of richard coeur de lion and when the king went on his third crusade in the year # * lee raised a company of gentlemen and marched with him to the holy land his career there was distinguished he displayed special gallantry at the siege of acre and for this he received a solid proof of king richards approbation on his return he was made first earl of * the king presented him with the estate of * which became the name afterward of an estate of the lees in virginia and when he died the armor which he had worn in the holy land was placed in the department of horse armory in the great tower of london the name of richard lee is next mentioned as one of the followers of the earl of * in his expedition across the scottish border in # two of the family about this period were knights companions of the * and their banners with the lee arms above were suspended in st georges chapel in * castle the coatofarms was a shield band sinister battled and * the crest a closed * surmounted by a squirrel holding a nut the motto which may be thought characteristic of one of general lees traits as a soldier was non * * such are the brief notices given of the family in england they seem to have been persons of high character and often of distinction when richard lee came to virginia and founded the family anew there as * the first lee had founded it in england he brought over in his veins some of the best and most valiant blood of the great norman race this richard lee the * of the family in virginia was it seems like the rest of his kindred strongly cavalier in his sentiments indeed the lees seem always to have been cavalier the reader will recall the stately old representative of the family in scotts * henry lee of * is seen stalking proudly through the great apartments of the palace in his laced * slashed boots and velvet cloak scowling darkly at the puritan intruders sir henry was not a fanciful person but a real individual and the political views attributed to him were those of the lee family who remained faithful to the royal cause in all its hours of adversity it will be seen that richard lee the first of the virginia lees was an ardent * he came over during the reign of charles i but returned to england * all his lands to his servants he subsequently came back to virginia however and lived and died there in his will he styles himself richard lee of * * in the county of essex * it is not certainly known whether he sought refuge in virginia after the failure of the kings cause or was tempted to * with a view to better his fortunes in the new world either may have been the impelling motive great numbers of cavaliers came over after the overthrow of charles at * but a large emigration had already taken place and took place afterward induced by the * of the country the ease of living and the * and * of the lands on the great rivers where families impoverished or of failing fortunes in england might make new settlements and build on a new foundation this would amply account for the removal of richard lee to virginia and for the ambition he seems to have been inspired with to build and improve without attributing to him any apprehension of probable punishment for his political course very many families had the * motives and commenced to build great * which were never finished or were too costly for any one of their descendants to possess the abolition of * despite the opposition of pendleton and others * all this and the lees like other families now possess few of the broad acres which their ancestors acquired to return however to richard lee he had already visited virginia in some official capacity under the royal governor sir william berkeley and had been so much pleased with the soil and climate of the country that he as we have said emigrated finally and cast his lot in the new land he brought a number of followers and servants and coming over to westmoreland county in the northern neck of virginia took up extensive * of land there and set about building * upon them among these it is stated was the original stratford house afterward destroyed by fire it was rebuilt however and became the birthplace of richard henry lee and afterward of general robert e lee we shall speak of it more in detail after finishing in a few words our notice of richard lee its founder and the founder of the lee family in virginia he is described as a person of great force of character and many * a man of good stature * visage enterprising genius sound head vigorous spirit and generous nature this may be suspected to partake of the nature of epitaph but of his courage and energy the proof remains in the action taken by him in connection with charles ii * it would seem in full measure the * and cavalier sentiments of his family he united with sir william berkeley the royal governor in the irregular proclamation of charles ii in virginia a year or two before his * on the english throne he had already it is reported on the authority of * tradition made a voyage across the atlantic to * where charles ii was then in exile and offered to erect his standard in virginia and proclaim him king there this proposition the young monarch declined shrinking with excellent good sense from a renewal under less favorable circumstances of the struggle which terminated at * lee was therefore compelled to return without having succeeded in his enterprise but he had made it seems a very strong impression in favor of virginia upon the somewhat frivolous young monarch when he came to his throne again charles ii graciously wore a * of virginia silk and virginia who had proved so faithful to him in the hour of his need was authorized by royal decree to rank thenceforward in the british empire with england scotland and ireland and bear upon her shield the motto en dat virginia * richard lee returned after his unsuccessful mission to the northern neck and addressed himself thenceforward to the management of his private fortunes and the affairs of the colony he had now become possessed of very extensive estates between the potomac and rappahannock rivers and elsewhere besides stratford he owned plantations called * neck * * neck war captains neck bishops neck and paradise with four thousand acres besides on the potomac lands in maryland three islands in chesapeake bay an interest in several * and innumerable indented and other servants he became a member of the kings council and lived in great elegance and comfort that he was a man of high character and of notable piety for an age of free living and worldly tendencies his will shows in that document he * his soul to that good and gracious god that gave it me and to my blessed * jesus christ assuredly trusting in and by his meritorious death and passion to receive salvation the attention of the reader has been particularly called to the character and career of richard lee not only because he was the founder of the family in virginia but because the traits of the individual reappear very prominently in the great soldier whose life is the subject of this volume the coolness courage energy and aptitude for great affairs which marked richard lee in the seventeenth century were unmistakably present in the character of robert e lee in the nineteenth century we shall conclude our notice of the family by calling attention to that great group of celebrated men who illustrated the name in the days of the revolution and exhibited the family characteristics as clearly these were richard henry lee of chantilly the famous orator and statesman who moved in the american congress the declaration of independence francis * lee a scholar of elegant attainments and high literary accomplishments who signed with his more renowned brother the declaration william lee who became sheriff of london and ably seconded the cause of the colonies and arthur lee diplomatist and representative of america abroad where he displayed as his diplomatic correspondence indicates untiring energy and devotion to the interests of the colonies the last of these brothers was philip * lee whose daughter * married her second cousin general henry lee this gentleman afterward famous as * harry lee married a second time and from this union sprung the subject of this memoir this celebrated soldier who so largely occupied the public eye in the revolution is worthy of notice both as an eminent member of the lee family and as the father of general robert e lee he was born in # in the county of * boasts of being the birthplace of washington monroe richard henry lee general henry lee and general robert e lee presidents statesmen and * after graduating at princeton college entered the army in 1776 as captain of cavalry an arm of the service afterward adopted by his more celebrated descendant in the united states army he soon displayed military ability of high order and for the capture of * hook received a gold * from congress in 1781 he marched with his legion to join greene in the carolinas carrying with him the high esteem of washington who had witnessed his skilful and daring operations in the * his career in the arduous campaigns of the south against cornwallis and the efficient commander of his cavalry arm colonel * may be best understood from general greenes dispatches and from his own memoirs of the operations of the army which are written with as much modesty as ability from these it is apparent that the small body of the legion cavalry under its active and daring commander was the eye and ear of greenes army whose movements it accompanied everywhere preceding its advances and covering its retreats few pages of military history are more stirring than those in lees memoirs describing greenes retrograde movement to the dan and this alone if the hard work at the * and elsewhere were left out would place lees fame as a cavalry officer upon a lasting basis the distinguished soldier under whose eye the virginian operated did full justice to his courage and capacity i believe wrote greene that few officers either in europe or america are held in so high a position of admiration as you are everybody knows i have the highest opinion of you as an officer and you know i love you as a friend no man in the progress of the campaign had equal merit with yourself the officer who wrote those lines was not a * nor a diplomatist but a * and honest soldier who had seen lees bearing in the most arduous straits and was capable of appreciating military ability add washingtons expression of his love and thanks in a letter written in 1789 and the light in which he was regarded by his contemporaries will be understood his memoirs of the war in the southern department is a valuable military history and a very interesting book the movements of greene in face of cornwallis are described with a precision which renders the narrative valuable to military students and a * which * the attention of the general reader from these memoirs a very clear conception of the writers character may be derived and everywhere in them is felt the presence of a cool and dashing nature a man gifted with the mens * in * whom no reverse of fortune could cast down the fairness and courtesy of the writer toward his opponents is an attractive characteristic of the work which is written with a simplicity and directness of style highly agreeable to readers of judgment after the war general henry lee served a term in congress was then elected governor of virginia returned in 1799 to congress and in his oration upon the death of washington employed the wellknown phrase first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen he died in georgia in the year 1818 having made a journey thither for the benefit of his health general henry lee was married twice first as we have said to his cousin * through whom he came into possession of the old family estate of stratford and a second time june # to miss anne hill carter a daughter of charles carter esq of shirley on james river the children of this second marriage were three sons and two * carter robert edward smith ann and mildred robert edward lee was born at stratford in westmoreland county virginia on the 19th of january 1807 before passing to lees public career and the narrative of the stormy scenes of his * let us pause a moment and bestow a glance upon this ancient mansion which is still * silent and melancholy relic of the * the remote northern neck as the birthplace of a great man it would demand attention but it has other claims still as a venerable memorial of the past and its eminent personages one of the few remaining monuments of a state of society that has disappeared or is disappearing the original stratford house is supposed as we have said to have been built by richard lee the first of the family in the new world whoever may have been its founder it was destroyed in the time of thomas lee an eminent representative of the name early in the eighteenth century thomas lee was a member of the kings council a gentleman of great popularity and when it was known that his house had been burned contributions were everywhere made to * it the governor the merchants of the colony and even queen anne in person united in this subscription the house speedily rose again at a cost of about eighty thousand dollars and this is the edifice still standing in westmoreland the sum expended in its construction must not be estimated in the light of today at that time the greater part of the heavy work in * was performed by servants of the manor it is fair indeed to say that the larger part of the work thus cost nothing in money and thus the eighty thousand dollars represented only the english brick the * furniture and decorations the construction of such an edifice had at that day a distinct object these great old * lost in the depths of the country were intended to become the headquarters of the family in all time in their large apartments the eldest son was to uphold the name generation after generation was to pass and some one of the old name still live there and though all this has passed away now and may appear a wornout superstition and though some persons may * it as contributing to the sentiment of aristocracy the strongest opponents of that old system may pardon in us the expression of some regret that this love of the hearthstone and old family memories should have disappeared the great man whose character is sought to be * in this volume never lost to the last this home and family sentiment he knew the * of every one and loved the old * of the old virginia * and honest people attached like himself to the virginia soil we pass to a brief description of the old house in which lee was born stratford the old home of the lees but today the property of others stands on a picturesque bluff on the southern bank of the potomac and is a house of very considerable size it is built in the form of the letter h the walls are several feet in * in the centre is a saloon thirty feet in size and surmounting each wing is a pavilion with * above which rise clusters of chimneys the front door is reached by a broad flight of steps and the grounds are handsome and variegated by the bright foliage of oaks cedars and * here and there in the extensive lawn rises a slender and ghostly old * * tree once a great favorite in virginia but now seen only here and there the relic of a past generation within the stratford house is as antique as without and with its halls corridors * and ancient * takes the visitor back to the era of powder and silk stockings such was the mansion to which general harry lee came to live after the revolution and the sight of the old home must have been dear to the soldiers heart here had flourished three generations of lees dispensing a profuse and * hospitality in each generation some one of the family had distinguished himself and attracted the best company to stratford the old walls had rung with merriment the great door was wide open everybody was welcome and one could see there a good illustration of a * manner of living which had at least the merit of being hearty * and picturesque general harry lee the careless soldier * of the family tendency to hospitality he kept open house entertained all comers and hence doubtless sprung the pecuniary embarrassments * an old age which his eminent public services should have rendered serene and happy our notice of stratford may appear unduly long to some readers but it is not without a distinct reference to the subject of this volume in this quiet old * in the very apartment where richard henry and francis * lee first saw the * e lee was born the eyes of the child fell first upon the old apartments the great grounds the homely scenes around the old * the tall * poplars and the oaks through which passed the wind bearing to his ears the murmur of the potomac he left the old home of his family before it could have had any very great effect upon him it would seem but it is impossible to estimate these first influences to decide the depth of the impression which the childs heart is capable of receiving the bright eyes of young robert lee must have seen much around him to interest him and shape his first views critics charged him with family pride sometimes if he possessed that virtue or failing the fact was not strange stratford opened before his childish eyes a memorial of the old splendor of the lees he saw around him old portraits old plate and old furniture telling plainly of the ancient origin and high position of his family old * contained histories of the deeds of his race old * trees traced their line far back into the past old servants grown gray in the house waited upon the child and in a corner of one of the great apartments an old soldier gray too and shattered in health once the friend of washington and greene was writing the history of the battles in which he had drawn his sword for his native land amid these scenes and surroundings passed the first years of robert e lee they must have made their impression upon his character at a period when the mind takes every new influence and grows in accordance with it and to the last the man remained simple hearty proud * country virginian in all the texture of his character he always rejoiced to visit the country loved horses was an excellent rider was fond of plain country talk jests humorous anecdote and * the plain country gentleman in a word preferring grass and trees and streams to all the cities and crowds in the world in the last year of his life he said to a lady my visits to florida and the white sulphur have not benefited me much but it did me good to go to the white house and see the mules walking round and the corn growing we notice a last result of the childs residence now or visits afterward to the country and the sports in which he * superb physical health and strength which remained unshaken afterward by all the hardships of war lee to the last was a marvel of sound physical development his frame was as solid as oak and stood the strain of exhausting marches loss of sleep hunger thirst heat and cold without failing him when he died it was care which crushed his heart his health was perfect of lees childhood we have no memorials except the words of his father long afterward robert was always good wrote general henry lee that is all but the words indicate * the good man was always good it will be seen that when he went to west point he never received a * the good boy was the good young officer and became in due time the good commanderinchief in the year 1811 general henry lee left stratford and removed with his family to alexandria actuated it seems by the desire of affording his children facilities for gaining their education after his death in 1818 mrs lee continued to reside in alexandria was a * of christ church and her children were taught the episcopal catechism by young william meade eventually bishop of virginia we shall see how bishop meade long afterward recalled those early days when he and his pupil young robert lee were equally * when about to die just as the war began in earnest he sent for the boy he had once instructed now the grayhaired soldier and when he came to the bedside exclaimed god bless you robert i cant call you * have heard you your catechism too often alexandria continued to be the residence of the family until the young man was eighteen years of age when it was necessary for him to make choice of a profession and following the bent of his temperament he chose the army application was made for his appointment from virginia as a cadet at west point he obtained the appointment and in 1825 at the age of eighteen entered the military academy his progress in his studies was steady and it is said that during his stay at west point he was never reprimanded nor marked with a * he graduated in july 1829 second in his class and was assigned to duty with the rank of lieutenant in the corps of engineers he is described by those who saw him at this time as a young man of great personal beauty and this is probably not an exaggeration as he remained to the last distinguished for the elegance and dignity of his person he had not yet lost what the cares of command afterward * gayety and * was noted it is said for the sweetness of his smile and the cordiality of his manners the person who gave the writer these details added he was a perfect gentleman three years after graduating at west * the year #* married mary custis daughter of mr george washington parke custis of arlington the adopted son of general washington and by this marriage he came into possession of the estate of arlington and the white * afterward well known in the war the life of lee up to the beginning of the great conflict of 186165 is of moderate interest only and we shall not dwell at length upon it he was employed on the coast defences in new york and virginia and in 1835 in running the boundary line between the states of ohio and michigan in september 1836 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in july 1838 to a * in 1844 he became a member of the board of visitors to the military academy in 1845 he was a member of the board of engineers and in 1846 when the mexican war broke out was assigned to duty as chief engineer of the central army of mexico in which capacity he served to the end of the war up to the date of the mexican war captain lee had attracted no public attention but had impressed the military authorities including general winfield scott with a favorable opinion of his ability as a topographical engineer for this department of military science he exhibited endowments of the first * other faculties of the soldier he possessed it remained for events to show this opportunity was now given him in the mexican war and the efficient character of his services may be seen in scotts * where captain lee of the engineers is mentioned in every report and everywhere with commendation from the beginning of operations the young officer seems to have been summoned to the councils of war and general scott particularly mentions that held at vera * serious an affair that a deathbed discussion could hardly have been more solemn the passages in which the lieutenantgeneral mentions lee are too numerous and not of sufficient interest to quote but two entries will exhibit the general tenor of this honorable mention after cerro gordo scott writes in his official report of the battle i am compelled to make special mention of captain re lee engineer this officer greatly distinguished himself at the siege of vera cruz was again indefatigable during these operations in reconnoissance as daring as laborious and of the utmost value after chapultepec he wrote captain lee so constantly distinguished also bore important orders for me september 13th until he fainted from a wound and the loss of two nights sleep at the batteries we may add here the statement of the hon reverdy johnson that he had heard general scott more than once say that his success in mexico was largely due to the skill valor and undaunted energy of robert e lee for these services lee received steady promotion for meritorious conduct at cerro gordo he was made brevet major for the same at contreras and * brevet lieutenantcolonel and after chapultepec he received the additional brevet of * fairly earned by energy and courage when the war ended lee returned to his former duties in the engineer corps of the usa and was placed in charge of the works then in process of construction at fort carroll near baltimore his assignment to the duty of thus superintending the military defences of hampton roads new york bay and the approaches to baltimore in succession would seem to indicate that his abilities as engineer were highly esteemed of his possession of such ability there can be no doubt the young officer was not only thoroughly trained in this high department of military science but had for his duties unmistakable natural endowments this fact was clearly indicated on many occasions in the confederate * eye for positions never failed him it is certain that had lee never commanded troops in the field he would have left behind him the reputation of an excellent engineer in 1855 he was called for the first time to command men for his duties hitherto had been those of military engineer astronomer or staffofficer the act of congress directing that two new cavalry regiments should be raised excited an ardent desire in the officers of the army to receive appointments in them and lee was transferred from his place of engineer to the post of lieutenantcolonel in the second cavalry one of the regiments in question the extraordinary number of names of officers in this regiment who afterward became famous is worthy of notice the colonel was albert sydney johnston the lieutenantcolonel re lee the senior major william j hardee the junior major george h thomas the senior captain earl * dorn the next ranking captain kirby smith the lieutenants hood fields * major fitzhugh lee johnson palmer and stoneman all of whom became general officers afterward on the southern side with the exception of thomas and the three last named who became prominent generals in the federal army it is rare that such a * of famous names is found in the list of officers of a single regiment the explanation is nevertheless simple positions in the new regiments were eagerly coveted by the best soldiers of the army and in appointing the officers those of conspicuous ability only were selected the second regiment of cavalry thus became the corps * of the united states army and after albert sydney johnston robert e lee was the ranking officer lee proceeded with his regiment to texas remaining there for several years on frontier duty and does not reappear again until 1859 such was the early career in the army of the soldier soon to become famous on a greater * of a * hardworking and conscientious officer with the single exception of his brief record in the mexican war his life had been passed in official duties unconnected with active military operations he was undoubtedly what is called a rising man but he had had no opportunity to display the greatest faculties of the soldier the time was coming now when he was to be tested and the measure of his faculties taken in one of the greatest wars which darken the pages of history a single incident of public importance marks the life of lee between 1855 and 1861 this was what is known to the world as the john brown * incident of the year 1859 and * the approaching storm this occurrence is too well known to require a minute account in these pages and we shall accordingly pass over it briefly indicating simply the part borne in the affair by lee he was in washington at the * fall of #* a visit to his family then residing at arlington near the city when intelligence came that a party of desperadoes had attacked and captured harpers ferry with the avowed intent of arming and inciting to insurrection the slaves of the neighborhood and entire state lee was immediately thereupon directed by president buchanan to proceed to the point of danger and arrest the * he did so promptly found upon his arrival that brown and his confederates had shut themselves up in an * of the town with a number of their prisoners brown was summoned to surrender to be delivered over to the authorities for civil * refused and lee then proceeded to assault with a force of marines the stronghold to which brown had retreated the doors were driven in brown firing upon the assailants and killing or wounding two but he and his men were cut down and captured they were turned over to the virginia authorities and lee having performed the duty assigned him returned to washington and soon afterward to texas he remained there commanding the department until the early spring of 1861 he was then recalled to washington at the moment when the conflict between the north and the south was about to commence lee found the country burning as with fever and the air hot with contending passions the animosity long smouldering between the two sections was about to burst into the flame of civil war all men were taking sides the war of discussion on the floor of congress was about to yield to the clash of bayonets and the roar of cannon on the battlefield any enumeration of the causes which led to this unhappy state of affairs would be worse than useless in a volume like the present even less desirable would be a discussion of the respective blame to be attached to each of the great opponents in * the bitter and longcontinued struggle such a discussion would lead to nothing and would probably leave every reader of the same opinion as before it would also be the repetition of a wornout and wearisome story these events are known of all men for the political history of the united states from 1820 when the slavery agitation began on the question of the missouri restriction to 1861 when it ended in civil * has been discussed * and discussed again in every journal great and small in the whole country the person who is not familiar therefore with the main points at issue must be ignorant beyond the power of any writer to enlighten him we need only say that the election of abraham lincoln the nominee of the republican party had determined the gulf states to leave the union south carolina accordingly seceded on the 20th of december 1860 and by the 1st of february 1861 she had been followed by mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana and texas the struggle thus approached military movements began at many points like those distant flashes of lightning and vague mutterings which herald the tempest early in february jefferson davis of mississippi was elected president of the confederate states at montgomery on the 13th of april fort sumter surrendered to general beauregard and on the next day april 14 1861 president lincoln issued his proclamation declaring the gulf states in rebellion and calling upon the states which had not seceded for seventyfive thousand men to enforce the federal authority tip to this time the older state of virginia had persistently resisted secession her refusal to array herself against the general government had been based upon an unconquerable repugnance it seemed for the dissolution of that union which she had so long loved from real attachment to the flag which she had done so much to make honorable and from a natural indisposition to rush headlong into a conflict whose whole fury would burst upon and desolate her own soil the proclamation of president lincoln however decided her course the convention had * refused week after week to pass the ordinance of secession now the naked question was whether virginia should fight with or against her sisters of the gulf states she was directed to furnish her quota of the seventyfive thousand troops called for by president lincoln and must decide at once on the 17th of april 1861 accordingly an ordinance of secession passed the virginia convention and that commonwealth cast her fortunes for weal or woe with the southern confederacy such is a brief and rapid summary of the important public events which had preceded or immediately followed lees return to washington in march 1861 a grave and to him a very solemn question demanded instant decision which side should he * side of the united states or that of the south to choose either caused him acute pain the attachment of the soldier to his flag is greater than the civilian can realize and lee had before him the brightest military prospects the brief record which we have presented of his military career in mexico conveys a very inadequate idea of the position which he had secured in the army he was regarded by the authorities at washington and by the country at large as the ablest and most promising of all the rising class of army officers upon general winfield scott commanderinchief of the federal army he had made an impression which is the most striking proof of his great merit general scott was enthusiastic in his expressions of admiration for the young virginian and with the death of that general which his great age rendered a probable event at any moment lee was sure to become a candidate for the highest promotion in the service to this his great ability gave him a title at the earliest possible moment and other considerations operated to advance his fortunes he was conceded by all to be a person of the highest moral character was the descendant of an influential and distinguished family which had rendered important services to the country in the revolution his father had been the friend of washington and had achieved the first glories of arms and the ample estates derived from his wife gave him that worldly prestige which has a direct influence upon the fortunes of an individual colonel lee could thus look forward without the imputation of presumption to positions of the highest responsibility and honor under the government with the death of scott and other aged officers of the army the place of commanderinchief would fall to the most deserving of the younger generation and of this generation there was no one so able and prominent as lee the personal relations of lee with general scott constituted another powerful temptation to decide him against going over to the southern side we have referred to the great admiration which the old soldier felt for the young officer he is said to have exclaimed on one occasion it would be better for every officer in the army including myself to die than robert lee there seems no doubt of the fact that scott looked to lee as his ultimate successor in the supreme command for which his character and military ability peculiarly fitted him warm personal regard gave additional strength to his feelings in lees favor and the consciousness of this regard on the part of his superior made it still more difficult for lee to come to a decision it is known that general scott used every argument to persuade lee not to resign to retain him in the service he had been appointed on his arrival at washington a full colonel and in 1860 his name had been sent in with others by scott as a proper person to fill the vacancy caused by the death of brigadiergeneral jessup to these tempting * that rapid promotion would attend his adherence to the united states flag scott added personal appeals which coming from him must have been almost irresistible for gods sake dont resign lee the lieutenantgeneral is said to have exclaimed and in the protracted interviews which took place between the two officers every possible argument was urged by the elder to decide lee to remain firm the attempt was in vain lees attachment to the flag he had so long fought under and his personal affection for general scott were great but his attachment to his native state was still more powerful by birth a virginian he declared that he owed his first duty to her and his own people if she summoned him he must obey the summons as long as she remained in the union he might remain in the united states army when she seceded from the union and took part with the gulf states he must follow her fortunes and do his part in defending her the struggle had been bitter but brief my husband has wept tears of blood mrs lee wrote to a friend over this terrible war but he must as a man and a virginian share the destiny of his state which has solemnly pronounced for independence the secession of virginia by a vote of the convention assembled at richmond decided lee in his course he no longer hesitated to general scotts urgent appeals not to send in his resignation he replied i am compelled to i cannot consult my own feelings in this matter he accordingly wrote to general scott from arlington on the 20th of april enclosing his resignation the letter was in the following words in this letter full of dignity and grave courtesy lee vainly attempts to hide the acute pain he felt at parting from his friend and abandoning the old service another letter written on the same day expresses the same sentiment of painful regret the expression used in this * i recognize no necessity for this state of * very clearly the political sentiments of the writer he did not regard the election of a republican president even by a strictly sectional vote as sufficient ground for a dissolution of the union it may be added here that such we believe was the opinion of a large number of southern officers at that time accustomed to look to the flag as that which they were called upon to defend against all comers they were loath to admit the force of the reasoning which justified secession and called upon them to abandon it their final action seems to have been taken from the same considerations which controlled the course of lee their states called them and they obeyed in resigning his commission and going over to the south lee sacrificed his private fortunes in addition to all his hopes of future promotion in the united states army his beautiful home arlington situated upon the heights opposite washington must be abandoned forever and fall into the hands of the enemy this old mansion was a model of peaceful loveliness and attraction all around here says a writer describing the place arlington heights presents a lovely picture of rural beauty the general lee house as some term it stands on a grassy lot surrounded with a grove of stately trees and underwood except in front where is a verdant sloping ground for a few rods when it descends into a valley spreading away in beautiful and broad expanse to the lovely potomac this part of the splendid estate is apparently a * meadow the grass waving in the gentle breeze like the undulating bosom of old atlantic to the south north and west the grounds are beautifully * into hill and valley and richly stored with oak willow and maple though the oak is the principal wood the view from the height is a charming picture washington georgetown and the intermediate potomac are all before you in the foreground in this old mansion crowning the grassy hill the young officer had passed the happiest moments of his life all around him were spots associated with his hours of purest enjoyment each object in the * old furniture and very * the memory of washington and were dear to him here were many pieces of the martha washington china portions of the porcelain set presented to mrs washington by lafayette and * the centre of each piece the * * with golden rays * to the names of the old thirteen states here were also fifty pieces remnants of the set of one thousand procured from china by the cincinnati society and presented to * of elaborate decoration in blue and gold with the coatofarms of the society held by fame with a blue ribbon from which is suspended the eagle of the order with a green wreath about its neck and on its breast a shield representing the inauguration of the order add to these the teatable used by washington and one of his bookcases old portraits antique furniture and other memorials of the lee family from * the reader imagine the old mansion stored with these priceless relics and he will understand with what anguish lee must have contemplated what came duly to pass the destruction by rude hands of objects so dear to him that he must have foreseen the fate of his home is certain to take sides with virginia was to give up arlington to its fate there is no proof however that this sacrifice of his personal fortunes had any effect upon him if he could decide to change his flag and dissolve every tie which bound him to the old service he could sacrifice all else without much regret no one will be found to say that the hope of rank or emolument in the south influenced him the character and whole career of the man contradict the idea his ground of action may be summed up in a single sentence he went with his state because he believed it was his duty to do so and because to ascertain what was his duty and perform it was the cardinal maxim of his life no sooner had intelligence of lees resignation of his commission in the united states army reached richmond than governor letcher appointed him majorgeneral of the military forces of virginia the appointment was confirmed by the convention rather by * than formal vote and on the 23d of april lee who had meanwhile left washington and repaired to richmond was honored by a formal presentation to the convention the address of president janney was eloquent and deserves to be preserved lee stood in the middle aisle and the president rising said the president concluded by saying that virginia on that day intrusted her spotless sword to lees keeping and lee responded as follows mr president and gentlemen of the convention profoundly impressed with the solemnity of the occasion for which i must say i was not prepared i accept the position assigned me by your partiality i would have much preferred had your choice fallen upon an abler man trusting in almighty god an approving conscience and the aid of my fellowcitizens i devote myself to the service of my native state in whose behalf alone will i ever again draw my sword such were the modest and dignified expressions of lee in accepting the great trust the reply is brief and simple but these are very great merits on such an occasion no portion of the address contains a phrase or word denunciatory of the federal government or of the motives of the opponents of virginia and this moderation and absence of all rancor characterized the utterances of lee both oral and written throughout the war he spoke doubtless as he felt and uttered no expression of heated animosity because he cherished no such sentiment his heart was bleeding still from the cruel trial it had undergone in abruptly tearing away from the old service to embark upon civil war with the emotions of the present occasion excited by the great ovation in his honor no bitterness * at least if there were such bitterness in his heart he did not permit it to rise to his lips he accepted the trust confided to him in terms of dignity and moderation worthy of washington exchanged grave salutations with the members of the convention and then retiring from the hall where he had solemnly consecrated his life to his native commonwealth proceeded at once to energetic work to get the state in a posture of defence the sentiment of the country in reference to lee was even warmer than that of the convention for weeks reports had been rife that he had determined to adhere to the federal government in the approaching struggle such an event it was felt by all would be a public calamity to virginia and the general joy may be imagined when it was known that lee had resigned and come to fight with his own people he assumed command therefore of all the virginia forces in the midst of universal public rejoicing and the fact gave strength and consistency to the general determination to resist the federal government to the last at this * #* lee was fiftyfour years of age and may be said to have been in the ripe vigor of every faculty physically and intellectually he was at his best and in the bloom of manhood his figure was erect and he bore himself with the brief somewhat stiff air of command derived from his military education and service in the army this air of the professional soldier which characterized generally the graduates of west point was replaced afterward by a grave dignity the result of high command and great responsibilities in april 1861 however he was rather the ordinary army officer in bearing than the commanderinchief he had always been remarkable for his manly beauty both of face and figure and the cares of great command had not yet whitened his hair there was not a gray hair in his head and his mustache was dark and heavy the rest of his face was cleanshaven and his cheeks had that fresh ruddy hue which indicates high physical health this was not at that time or afterward the result of high living of all the prominent personages of his epoch lee was perhaps the most temperate he rarely drank even so much as a single glass of wine and it was a matter of general notoriety in the army afterward that he cared not what he ate the ruddy appearance which characterized him from first to last was the result of the most * physical health which no species of indulgence had ever impaired he used no tobacco then or afterward in any * * weed which has been called the soldiers * seemed indeed superior to all those small vices which assail men of his profession grave silent with a military composure of bearing which amounted at times as we have said to stiffness he resembled a machine in the shape of a man at least this was the impression which he produced upon those who saw him in public at this time the writers design here is to indicate the personal appearance and bearing of general lee on the threshold of the war it may be said by way of summing up all that he was a * * in appearance the * as distinguished from the civilian and no doubt impressed those who held official interviews with him as a personage of marked reserve the truth and frankness of the man under all circumstances and his great warm heart full of honesty and unassuming simplicity became known only in the progress of the war how simple and true and honest he was will appear from a letter to his son * custis lee written some time before you must study he wrote to be frank with the world frankness is the child of honesty and courage say just what you mean to do on every occasion and take it for granted you mean to do right if a friend asks a favor you should grant it if it is reasonable if not tell him plainly why you cannot you will wrong him and wrong yourself by * of any kind never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one the man who requires you to do so is dearly purchased at a sacrifice deal kindly but firmly with all your classmates you will find it the policy which wears best above all do not appear to others what you are not if you have any fault to find with any one tell him not others of what you complain there is no more dangerous experiment than that of undertaking to be one thing before a mans face and another behind his back we should live act and say nothing to the injury of any one it is not only best as a matter of principle but it is the path to peace and honor in regard to duty let me in conclusion of this hasty letter inform you that nearly a hundred years ago there was a day of remarkable gloom and * known as the dark * day when the light of the sun was slowly extinguished as if by an eclipse the legislature of connecticut was in session and as its members saw the unexpected and unaccountable darkness coming on they shared in the general awe and terror it was supposed by many that the last * day of * come some one in the consternation of the hour moved an adjournment then there arose an old puritan * * of * and said that if the last day had come he desired to be found at his place doing his duty and therefore moved that candles be brought in so that the house could proceed with its duty there was * in that mans mind the * of heavenly wisdom and inflexible willingness to obey present duty duty then is the sublimest word in our language do your duty in all things like the old puritan you cannot do more you should never wish to do less never let me and your mother wear one gray hair for any lack of duty on your part the maxims of this letter indicate the noble and conscientious character of the man who wrote it frankness is the child of honesty and courage say just what you mean to do on every occasion never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one duty is the sublimest word in our language do your duty in all things you cannot do more that he lived up to these great maxims amid all the troubled scenes and hot passions of a stormy epoch is lees greatest glory his fame as a soldier great as it is * to the true glory of having placed duty before his eyes always as the supreme object of life he resigned his commission from a sense of duty to his native state made this same duty his sole aim in every portion of his subsequent career and when all had failed and the cause he had fought for was overthrown it was the consciousness of having performed conscientiously and to his utmost his whole duty which took the sting from defeat and gave him that noble calmness which the whole world saw and admired human virtue should be equal to human calamity were his august words when all was lost and mens minds were sinking under the accumulated agony of defeat and despair those words could only have been uttered by a man who made duty the paramount object of * performance of it the true glory and crown of virtuous manhood it may be objected by some critics that he mistook his duty in * the southern cause doubtless many persons will urge that objection and declare that the words here written are senseless panegyric but that will not affect the truth or detract from lees great character he performed at least what in his inmost soul he considered his duty and from the beginning of his career when all was so bright to its termination when all was so dark it will be found that his controlling sentiment was first last and all the time this performance of duty the old puritan whose example he admired so much was not more calm and resolute when the last day of the cause he fought for * the spring of #* was plain to all who saw the man standing unmoved in the midst of the general disaster that his sole desire was to be found at his place and doing his duty from this species of digression upon the moral constituents of the individual we pass to the record of that career which made the great fame of the soldier the war had already begun when lee took command of the provisional forces of virginia and the collisions in various portions of the gulf states between the federal and state authorities were followed by * acts in virginia which all felt would be the real battleground of the war the north entered upon the struggle with very great ardor and enthusiasm the call for volunteers to enforce obedience to the federal authority was tumultuously responded to throughout the entire north and troops were hurried forward to washington which soon became an enormous camp the war began in virginia with the evacuation and attempted destruction of the works at harpers ferry by the federal officer in command there this was on the 19th of april and on the next day reinforcements were thrown into fortress monroe and the navyyard at norfolk with the shipping set on fire and abandoned lee thus found the commonwealth in a state of war and all his energies were immediately concentrated upon the work of placing her in a condition of defence he established his headquarters in the customhouse at richmond orderlies were seen coming and going bustle reigned throughout the building and by night as well as by day general lee labored incessantly to organize the means of resistance from the first moment all had felt that virginia from her geographical position adjoining the federal frontier and facing the federal capital would become the arena of the earliest longest and most determined struggle her large territory and moral influence as the oldest of the southern states also made her the chief object of the federal hostility it was felt that if virginia were occupied and her people reduced under the federal authority again the southern cause would be deprived of a large amount of its prestige and strength the authorities of the gulf states accordingly hurried forward to richmond all available troops and from all parts of virginia the volunteer regiments which had sprung up like magic were in like manner forwarded by railway to the capital every train brought additions to this great mass of raw war material large camps rose around richmond chief among which was that named camp lee and the work of drilling and moulding this crude material for the great work before it was ardently proceeded with under the supervision of lee an executive board or military council had been formed consisting of governor letcher and other prominent officials but these gentlemen had the good sense to intrust the main work of organizing an army to lee as yet the great question at richmond was to place virginia in a state of * prepare that commonwealth for the hour of trial by * her own people it will be remembered that lee held no commission from the confederate states he was majorgeneral of the provisional army of virginia and to place this provisional army in a condition to take the field was the first duty before him it was difficult not from want of ardor in the population but from the want of the * material necessary in time of war there were few arms and but small supplies of ammunition while the federal government entered upon the war with the * resources the south found herself almost entirely destitute of the munitions essential to her protection all was to be organized and put at once into * quartermaster commissary ordnance and other departments transportation supplies of rations arms ammunition all were to be collected immediately the material existed or could be supplied as the sequel clearly showed but as yet there was almost nothing and it was chiefly to the work of organizing these departments first of all that general lee and the military council addressed themselves with the utmost energy the result was that the state found herself very soon in a condition to offer a determined resistance the troops at the various camps of instruction were successively sent to the field others took their places and the work of drilling the raw material into soldiers went on supplies were collected transportation found workshops for the construction of arms and ammunition sprung up smallarms cannon cartridges fixed and other ammunition were produced in quantities and in a time which now seems wholly inadequate for such a result the commonwealth of virginia was ready to take the field against the federal government early in may virginia became formally a member of the southern confederacy and the troops which she had raised a portion of the confederate states army when richmond became the capital soon afterward and the southern congress assembled five brigadiergenerals were appointed generals cooper albert s johnston lee je johnston and beauregard large forces had been meanwhile raised throughout the south virginia became the centre of all eyes as the scene of the main struggle and early in june occurred at bethel in lower virginia the first prominent affair in which general butler with about four thousand men was repulsed and forced to retire the affair at bethel which was of small importance was followed by movements in northern and western * battles at rich mountain and * ford johnstons movements in the valley and the advance of the main federal army on the force under beauregard which resulted in the first battle of manassas in these events general lee bore no part and we need not speak of them further than to present a summary of the results the federal design had been to penetrate virginia in three columns one was to advance from the northwest under general mcclellan a second under general patterson was to take possession of the valley and a third under general mcdowell was to drive beauregard back from manassas on richmond only one of these * of * in its undertaking johnston held patterson in check in the valley until the advance upon manassas then by a flank march the confederate general hastened to the assistance of beauregard the battle of manassas followed on sunday the 21st of july after an unsuccessful attempt to force the confederate right general mcdowell assailed their left making for that purpose a long * at first carried all before him renforcements were hurried forward however and the confederates fought with the energy of men defending their own soil the obstinate stand made by evans bee bartow jackson and their brave associates turned the fortunes of the day and when renforcements subsequently reached the field under general kirby smith and general early the federal troops retreated in great disorder toward washington general lee nowhere appears as we have seen in these first great movements and conflicts he was without any specific command and remained at richmond engaged in placing that city in a state of defence the works which he constructed proved subsequently of great importance to the city and a northern officer writes of lee while the fortifications of richmond stand his name will evoke admiration the art of war is unacquainted with any defence so admirable lees first appearance in the war as commander of troops in the field took place in the fall of 1861 when he was sent to operate against the forces under general rosecrans in the fastnesses of western virginia this indecisive and unimportant movement has been the subject of various comment the official reports were burned in the conflagration at richmond or captured and the elaborate plans drawn up by lee of his intended movement against general reynolds at cheat mountain have in the same manner disappeared under these circumstances and as the present writer had no personal knowledge of the subject it seems best to simply quote the brief statement which follows it is derived from an officer of high rank and character whose statement is only second in value to that of general lee himself the months spent by general lee in superintending the coast defences of south carolina and georgia present nothing of interest and we shall therefore pass to the spring of 1862 when he returned to richmond his services as engineer had been highly appreciated by the people of the south and a writer of the period said the time will yet come when his superior abilities will be vindicated both to his own renown and the glory of his country the time was now at hand when these abilities if the individual possessed them were to have an opportunity to display themselves a touching incident of lees life belongs to this * early spring of 1862 bishop meade the venerable head of the episcopal church in virginia lay at the point of death in the city of richmond when general lee was informed of the fact he exhibited lively emotion for the good bishop as we have said in the commencement of this narrative had taught him his catechism when he was a boy in alexandria on the day before the bishops death general lee called in the morning to see him but such was the state of prostration under which the sick man labored that only a few of his most intimate friends were permitted to have access to his chamber in the evening general lee called again and his name was announced to bishop meade as soon as he heard it he said faintly for his breathing had become much oppressed and he spoke with great difficulty i must see him if only for a few moments general lee was accordingly introduced and approached the dying man with evidences of great emotion in his countenance taking the thin hand in his own he said how do you feel bishop almost gone replied bishop meade in a voice so weak that it was almost inaudible but i wanted to see you once more he paused for an instant breathing heavily and looking at lee with deep feeling god bless you god bless you robert he faltered out and fit you for your high and responsible duties i cant call you * must call you robert i have heard you your catechism too often general lee pressed the feeble hand and tears rolled down his cheeks yes * often he said in reply to the last words uttered by the bishop a brief conversation followed bishop meade making inquiries in reference to mrs lee who was his own relative and other members of the family he also says the * clergyman who furnishes these particulars put some pertinent questions to general lee about the state of public affairs and of the army showing the most lively interest in the success of our cause it now became necessary to terminate an interview which in the feeble condition of the aged man could not be prolonged much exhausted and laboring under deep emotion bishop meade shook the general by the hand and said heaven bless you heaven bless you and give you wisdom for your important and arduous duties these were the last words uttered during the interview general lee pressed the dying mans hand released it stood for several minutes by the bedside motionless and in perfect silence and then went out of the room on the next morning bishop meade expired the pathetic interview which we have just described took place in the month of march 1862 by the latter part of that month general mcclellan in command of an army of more than one hundred thousand men landed on the peninsula between the james and york rivers and after * engagements with the forces of general johnston advanced up the * confederates slowly retiring in the latter part of may a portion of the federal forces had crossed the chickahominy and confronted general johnston defending richmond such was the serious condition of affairs in the spring of 1862 the federal sword had nearly pierced the heart of virginia and as the course of events was about to place lee in charge of her destinies a brief notice is indispensable of the designs of the adversaries against whom he was to contend on the great arena of the state while the south had been lulled to sleep as it were by the battle of manassas the north greatly enraged at the disaster had prepared to prosecute the war still more vigorously the military resources of the south had been plainly * it was now obvious that the north had to fight with a dangerous adversary and that the people of the south were entirely in earnest many journals of the north had ridiculed the idea of war and one of them had spoken of the great * of the southern states from the potomac to the gulf of mexico as a mere local commotion which a force of fifty thousand men would be able to put down without difficulty a column of twentyfive thousand men it was said would be sufficient to carry all before it in virginia and capture richmond and the comment on this statement had been the battle of manassas where a force of more than fifty thousand had been defeated and driven back to washington it was thus apparent that the war was to be a serious struggle in which the north would be compelled to exert all her energies the people responded to the call upon them with enthusiasm all the roving and adventurous elements of northern society flocked to the federal standard and in a short time a large force had once more assembled at washington the work now was to drill * and put it in efficient condition for taking the field this was undertaken with great energy the congress coperating with the executive in every manner the city of washington resounded with the wheels of artillery and the tramp of cavalry the workshops were busy night and day to supply arms and ammunition and the best officers devoted themselves without rest to the work of drilling and * the mass by the spring of 1862 a force of about two hundred thousand men was ready to take the field in virginia general scott was not to command in the coming campaigns he had retired in the latter part of the year 1861 and his place had been filled by a young officer of rising * george b mcclellan who had achieved the successes of rich mountain and * ford in western virginia general mcclellan was not yet forty but had impressed the authorities with a high opinion of his abilities a soldier by profession and enjoying the distinction of having served with great credit in the mexican war he had been sent as united states military commissioner to the crimea and on his return had written a book of marked ability on the military organizations of the powers of europe when the struggle between the north and south approached he was * what truth we know * have hesitated before determining upon his course but it is probable that the only question with him was whether he should fight for the north or remain neutral in his politics he was a democrat and the war on the south is said to have shocked his staterights view but whatever his sentiments had been he accepted command and fought a successful campaign in western virginia from that moment his name became famous he was said to have achieved two victories in one day and he received from the newspapers the flattering name of the young napoleon the result of this successful campaign slight in importance as it was procured for general mcclellan the high post of commanderinchief of the armies of the united states operations in every portion of the south were to be directed by him and he was especially intrusted with the important work of organizing the new levies at washington this he performed with very great ability under his vigorous hand the raw material soon took shape he gave his personal attention to every department and the result as we have said in the early spring of 1862 was an army of more than two hundred thousand men for operations in virginia alone the great point now to be determined was the best line of operations against richmond president lincoln was strongly in favor of an advance by way of manassas and the orange and alexandria railroad which he thought would insure the safety of the federal capital this was always throughout the whole war a controlling consideration with him and regarded in the light of subsequent events this solicitude seems to have been well founded more than once afterward general * use his own * of * queens that is to say advancing upon washington without regard to the capture of richmond and president lincoln with that excellent good sense which he generally exhibited felt that the loss of washington would prove almost fatal to the federal * was the origin of the presidents preference for the manassas line general mcclellan did not share it he assented it seems at first but soon resolved to adopt another * advance either from * on the rappahannock or from west point on the york against his views and determination the president and authorities struggled in vain mcclellan treated their arguments and appeals with a want of ceremony amounting at times nearly to contempt he adhered to his own plan resolutely and in the end the president gave way in * protest against the continued inactivity of general mcclellan president lincoln had exclaimed if general mcclellan does not want to use the army i would like to borrow it and if something is not soon done the bottom will be out of the whole affair at last general mcclellan carried his point and an advance against richmond from the peninsula was decided upon in order to assist this movement general fremont was to march through northwestern virginia and general banks up the valley and having thus arranged their programme the federal authorities began to move forward to the great work to transport an army of more than one hundred thousand men by water to the peninsula was a heavy undertaking but the ample resources of the government enabled them to do so without difficulty general mcclellan who had now been removed from his post of commanderinchief of the armies of the united states and assigned to the command only of the army to operate against richmond landed his forces on the peninsula and after several actions of an obstinate description advanced toward the chickahominy general johnston the confederate commander deliberately retiring johnston took up a position behind this stream and toward the end of may mcclellan crossed a portion of his forces and confronted him the army thus threatening the city which had become the capital of the confederacy was large and excellently equipped it numbered in all according to general mcclellans report one hundred and * thousand eight hundred and thirtyeight men of whom one hundred and fifteen thousand one hundred and two were effective * is to say present and ready for duty as fightingmen in the field results of such magnitude were expected from this great army that all the resources of the federal government had been taxed to bring it to the highest possible state of efficiency the artillery was numerous and of the most approved description smallarms of the best patterns and * were profusely supplied the ammunition was of the finest quality and almost inexhaustible in quantity and the rations for the subsistence of the troops which were equally excellent and abundant were brought up in an unfailing stream from the white house in general mcclellans rear over the york river railroad which ran straight to his army such was the admirable condition of the large force under command of general mcclellan it would be difficult to imagine an army better prepared for active operations and the position which it held had been well selected the left of the army was protected by the wellnigh impassable * of the whiteoak swamp and all the approaches from the direction of richmond were obstructed by the natural difficulties of the ground which had been rendered still more forbidding by an * of felled trees and earthworks of the best description unless the right of mcclellan on the northern bank of the chickahominy were turned by the confederates his communications with his base at the white house and the safety of his army were assured and even the apparently improbable contingency of such an assault on his right had been provided for other bodies of federal troops had advanced into virginia to coperate with the main force on the peninsula general mcdowell the able soldier who had nearly defeated the confederates at manassas was at fredericksburg with a force of about forty thousand men which were to advance southward without loss of time and unite with general mcclellans right this would completely insure the communications of his army from interruption and it was no doubt expected that generals fremont and banks would coperate in the movement also fremont was to advance from northwestern virginia driving before him the small confederate force under jackson in the valley and general banks then at winchester was to cross the blue ridge mountains and posting his forces along the manassas railroad guard the approaches to washington when mcdowell advanced from fredericksburg to the aid of general mcclellan thus richmond would be half encircled by federal armies general mcclellan if permitted by the confederates to carry out his plan of operations would soon be in command of about two hundred thousand men and with this force it was anticipated he would certainly be able to capture richmond such was the federal programme of the war in virginia it promised great results and ought it would seem to have succeeded the confederate forces in virginia did not number in all one hundred thousand men and it is now apparent that without the able strategy of johnston lee and jackson general mcclellan would have been in possession of richmond before the summer prompt action was thus necessary on the part of the sagacious soldier commanding the army at richmond and directing operations throughout the theatre of action in virginia the officer in question was general joseph e johnston a virginian by birth who had first held general patterson in check in the shenandoah valley and then hastened to the assistance of general beauregard at manassas where in right of his superior rank he took command before the enemys design to advance up the peninsula had been developed johnston had made a masterly retreat from manassas reappearing with his force of about forty thousand men on the peninsula he had obstinately opposed mcclellan and only retired when he was compelled by numbers to do so with the resolution however of fighting a decisive battle on the chickahominy in face figure and character general johnston was thoroughly the soldier above the medium height with an erect figure in a * uniform buttoned to the chin with a ruddy face decorated with * gray sidewhiskers mustache and tuft on the chin reserved in manner brief of speech without impulses of any description it seemed general johnstons appearance and bearing were military to stiffness and he was popularly compared to a * ready for battle at any moment as a soldier his reputation was deservedly high to unshrinking personal courage he added a farreaching capacity for the conduct of great operations throughout his career he enjoyed a profound public appreciation of his abilities as a commander and was universally respected as a gentleman and a patriot general johnston surveying the whole field in virginia and penetrating it would seem the designs of the enemy had hastened to direct general jackson commanding in the valley to begin offensive operations and by threatening the federal force * washington in * the heavy pressure upon the main arena jackson carried out these instructions with the vigor which marked all his operations in march he advanced down the valley in the direction of winchester and coming upon a considerable force of the enemy at kernstown made a vigorous assault upon them a heavy engagement ensued and though jackson was defeated and compelled to retreat a very large federal force was retained in the valley to protect that important region a more decisive diversion soon followed jackson advanced in may upon general banks then at strasburg drove him from that point to and across the potomac and such was the apprehension felt at washington that president lincoln ordered general mcdowell then at fredericksburg with about forty thousand men to send twenty thousand across the mountains to strasburg in order to pursue or cut off jackson thus the whole federal programme in virginia was thrown into confusion general banks after the fight at kernstown was kept in the valley after jacksons second attack upon him when general banks was driven across the potomac and washington threatened general mcdowell was directed to send half his army to operate against jackson thus general mcclellan waiting at richmond for mcdowell to join him did not move with a portion of his army on one side of the stream and the remainder on the other side he remained inactive hesitating and unwilling as any good soldier would have been to commence the decisive assault his indecision was brought to an end by general johnston discovering that the force in his front near seven pines on the southern bank of the chickahominy was only a portion of the federal army general johnston determined to attack it this resolution was not in consequence of the freshet in the chickahominy as has been supposed * johnston to attack while the federal army was cut in two as it were his resolution he states had already been taken and was with or without reference to the rains that of a good soldier general johnston struck at general mcclellan on the last day of may just at the moment it appears when the federal commander designed commencing his last advance upon the city the battle which took place was one of the most desperate and bloody of the war both sides fought with obstinate courage and neither gained a decisive advantage on the confederate right near seven pines the federal line was broken and forced back but on the left at fair oaks station the confederates in turn were repulsed night fell upon a field where neither side could claim the victory the most that could be claimed by the southerners was that mcclellan had received a severe check and they sustained a great misfortune in the wound received by general johnston he was struck by a fragment of shell while superintending the attack at fair oaks and the nature of his wound rendered it impossible for him to retain command of the army he therefore retired from the command and repaired to richmond where he remained for a long time an invalid wholly unable to continue in service in the field this untoward event rendered it necessary to find a new commander for the army without loss of time general lee had returned some time before from the south and to him all eyes were turned he had had no opportunity to display his abilities upon a conspicuous * sole command he had been intrusted with that in * virginia could scarcely be called a real * he owed his elevation now to the place vacated by general johnston rather to his services performed in the old army of the united states than to any thing he had effected in the war of the confederacy the confidence of the virginia people in his great abilities had never wavered and there is no reason to suppose that the confederate authorities were backward in * his merits as a soldier whatever may have been the considerations leading to his appointment he was assigned on the 3d day of june to the command of the army and thus the virginians assembled to defend the capital of their state found themselves under the command of the most illustrious of their own countrymen lee had up to this time effected as we have shown almost nothing in the progress of the war intrusted with no command and employed only in organizing the forces or superintending the construction of defences he had failed to achieve any of those successes in the field which constitute the glory of the soldier he might possess the great abilities which his friends and admirers claimed for him but he was yet to show the world at large that he did really possess them the decisive moment had now arrived which was to test him he was placed in command of the largest and most important army in the confederacy and to him was intrusted the defence of the capital not only of virginia but of the south if richmond were to fall the confederate congress executive and heads of departments would all be fugitives the evacuation of virginia might or might not follow but in the very commencement of the conflict the enemy would achieve an immense advantage recognition by the european powers would be hopeless in such an event and the wandering and fugitive government of the confederacy would excite only contempt such were the circumstances under which general lee assumed command of the army of northern virginia as it was soon afterward styled the date of his assignment to duty was june 3 #* days after general johnston had retired in consequence of his wound thirty days afterward the great campaign around richmond had been decided and to the narrative of what followed the appointment of lee we shall at once proceed after giving a few words to another subject connected with his family when general lee left washington to repair to richmond he removed the ladies of his family from arlington to the white house on the pamunkey near the spot where that river unites with the * to form the york river this estate like the arlington property had come into possession of general lee through his wife and as arlington was exposed to the enemy the ladies had taken refuge here with the hope that they would be safe from intrusion or danger the result was unfortunate the white house was a favorable base for the federal army and intelligence one day reached mrs lee and her family that the enemy were approaching the ladies therefore hastened from the place to a point of greater safety and before her departure mrs lee is said to have affixed to the door a paper containing the following words northern soldiers who profess to reverence washington forbear to * the home of his first married life the property of his wife now owned by her descendants when the federal forces took possession of the place a northern officer it is said wrote beneath this a northern officer has protected your property in sight of the enemy and at the request of your overseer the resolute spirit of mrs lee is indicated by an incident which followed she took refuge with her daughters in a friends house near richmond and when a federal officer was sent to search the house handed to him a paper addressed to the general in command in which she wrote sir i have patiently and humbly submitted to the search of my house by men under your command who are satisfied that there is nothing here which they want all the plate and other valuables have long since been removed to richmond and are now beyond the reach of any northern * who may wish for their possession the ladies finally repaired for safety to the city of richmond and the white house was burned either before or when general mcclellan retreated the place was not without historic interest as the scene of washingtons first interview with martha custis who afterward became his wife he was married either at st peters church near by or in the house which originally stood on the site of the one now destroyed by the federal forces its historic associations thus failed to protect the white house and like arlington it fell a sacrifice to the pitiless hand of war from this species of digression we come back to the narrative of public events and the history of the great series of battles which were to make the banks of the chickahominy historic ground on taking command lee had assiduously addressed himself to the task of increasing the efficiency of the army riding incessantly to and fro he had inspected with his own eyes the condition of the troops officers of the commissary quartermaster and ordnance departments were held to a strict * and in a short time the army was in a high state of efficiency what was the amount of the confederate force under command of lee it may be asked the present writer is unable to state this number with any thing like exactness the official record if in existence is not accessible and the matter must be left to conjecture it is tolerably certain however that even after the arrival of jackson the army numbered less than seventyfive thousand officers of high rank and character state the whole force to have been sixty or seventy thousand only it will thus be seen that the federal army was larger than the confederate but this was comparatively an unimportant fact the event was decided rather by generalship than the numbers of the combatants general lee assumed command of the army on the 3d of june a week afterward jackson finished the great campaign of the valley by defeating generals fremont and shields at port republic such had been the important services performed by the famous stonewall jackson who was to become the right arm of lee in the greater campaigns of the future retreating after the defeat of general banks and passing through strasburg just as fremont from the west and the twenty thousand men of general mcdowell from the east rushed to intercept him jackson had sullenly fallen back up the valley with all his captured stores and prisoners and at cross keys and port republic had achieved a complete victory over his two adversaries fremont was checked by ewell who then hastened across to take part in the attack on shields the result was a federal defeat and retreat down the valley jackson was free to move in any direction and his army could unite with that at richmond for a decisive attack upon general mcclellan the attack in question had speedily been resolved on by lee any further advance of the federal army would bring it up to the very earthworks in the suburbs of the city and unless the confederate authorities proposed to undergo a siege it was necessary to check the further advance of the enemy by a general attack how to attack to the best advantage was now the question the position of general mcclellans army has been briefly stated advancing up the peninsula he had reached and passed the chickahominy and was in sight of richmond to this stream the natural line of defence of the city on the north and east numerous roads diverged from the capital including the york river railroad of which the federal commander made such excellent use and general mcclellan had thrown his left wing across the stream advancing to a point on the railroad four or five miles from the city here he had erected heavy defences to protect that wing until the right wing crossed in turn the tangled thickets of the whiteoak swamp on his left flank were a natural defence but he had added to these obstacles as we have stated by * trees and guarding every approach by redoubts in these heavy artillery kept watch against an approaching enemy and any attempt to attack from that quarter seemed certain to result in repulse in front toward seven pines the chance of success was equally doubtful the excellent works of the federal commander bristled with artillery and were heavily manned it seemed thus absolutely necessary to discover some other point of assault and as the federal right beyond the chickahominy was the only point left it was determined to attack if possible in that quarter an important question was first however to be decided the character of the defences if any on general mcclellans right in the direction of old church and cold harbor a reconnoissance in force was necessary to acquire this information and general lee accordingly directed general stuart commanding the cavalry of the army to proceed with a portion of his command to the vicinity of old church in the federal rear and gain all the information possible of their position and defences general james * stuart who now made his first prominent appearance upon the theatre of the war was a virginian by birth and not yet thirty years of age resigning his commission of lieutenant in the united states cavalry at the beginning of the war he had joined johnston in the valley and impressed that officer with a high opinion of his abilities as a cavalry officer proceeded thence to manassas where he charged and broke a company of zouave infantry protected the rear of the army when johnston retired to the rappahannock and bore an active part in the conflict on the peninsula in person he was of medium height his frame was broad and powerful he wore a heavy brown beard flowing upon his breast a huge mustache of the same color the ends curling upward and the blue eyes flashing beneath a * forehead had at times the dazzling brilliancy attributed to the eyes of the eagle fond of movement adventure bright colors and all the pomp and * of war stuart had entered on the struggle with ardor and enjoyed it as the huntsman enjoys the chase young ardent ambitious as brave as steel ready with jest or laughter with his * following him going into the hottest battles humming a song this young virginian was in truth an original character and impressed powerfully all who approached him one who knew him well wrote every thing striking brilliant and picturesque seemed to centre in him the war seemed to be to stuart a splendid and exciting game in which his blood coursed joyously and his immensely strong physical organization found an arena for the display of all its faculties the affluent life of the man craved those perils and hardships which flush the pulses and make the heart beat fast he swung himself into the saddle at the sound of the bugle as the hunter springs on horseback and at such moments his cheeks glowed and his huge mustache curled with enjoyment the romance and poetry of the hard trade of arms seemed first to be inaugurated when this joyous cavalier with his floating plume and splendid laughter appeared upon the great arena of the war in virginia precise people shook their heads and called him frivolous * his great ability those best capable of judging him were of a different opinion johnston wrote to him from the west how can i eat or sleep in peace without you upon the outpost jackson said when he fell at chancellorsville go back to general stuart and tell him to act upon his own judgment and do what he thinks best i have implicit confidence in him lee said when he was killed at yellow tavern i can scarcely think of him without weeping and the brave general sedgwick of the united states army said stuart is the best cavalry officer ever * in north america in the summer of 1862 when we present him to the reader stuart had as yet achieved little fame in his profession but he was burning to distinguish himself he responded ardently therefore to the order of lee and was soon ready with a picked force of about fifteen hundred cavalry under some of his best officers among them were colonels william hf lee and fitzhugh * first a son of general lee a graduate of west point and an officer of distinction afterward the second a son of smith lee brother of the general and famous subsequently in the most brilliant scenes of the war as the gay and gallant general fitz lee of the cavalry with his picked force * by the two lees and other excellent lieutenants stuart set out on his adventurous expedition to old church he effected more than he anticipated and performed a daring feat of arms in addition driving the outposts from hanover courthouse he charged and broke a force of federal cavalry near old church pushed on to the york river railroad which he crossed burning or capturing all federal stores met with including enormous * and then finding the way back barred against him and the federal army on the alert he continued his march with rapidity passed entirely around general mcclellans army and building a bridge over the chickahominy safely * the confederate lines just as a large force made its appearance in his rear the temporary bridge was destroyed however and stuart hastened to report to his superiors his information was important general mcclellans right and rear were unprotected by works of any strength if the confederate general desired to attack in that quarter there was nothing to prevent the results of stuarts famous ride around mcclellan as the people called it determined general lee to make the attack on the north bank of the stream if he had not already so decided it was necessary now to bring jacksons forces from the valley without delay and almost equally important to mask the movement from general mcclellan to this end a very simple ruse was adopted on the 11th of june whitings division was embarked on the cars of the danville railroad at richmond and moved across the river to a point near belle isle where at that moment a considerable number of federal prisoners were about to be released and sent down james river here the train loaded with confederate troops remained for some time and the secret was discovered by the released prisoners general lee was renforcing jackson in order that the latter might march on washington such was the report carried to general mcclellan and it seems to have really deceived him whitings division reached lynchburg and was thence moved by railway to * marched and countermarched with an elaborate pretence of advancing down the * last one morning the astute confederate who kept his own counsels had disappeared he was marching rapidly to join lee on the chickahominy not even his own soldiers knew what direction they were taking they were forbidden by general order to inquire even the names of the towns they passed through directed to reply i dont know to every question and it is said that when jackson demanded the name and regiment of a soldier robbing a * he could extract from the man no reply but i dont know jackson advanced with rapidity and on the 25th of june was near ashland here he left his forces and rode on rapidly to richmond passing * through the streets after night he went on to general lees headquarters at a house on the ninemile road leading from the new bridge road toward fair oaks station and here took place the first interview since the commencement of the war between lee and jackson what each thought of the other will be shown in the course of this narrative we shall proceed now with the history of the great series of battles for which jacksons appearance was the signal the chickahominy whose banks were now to be the scene of a bitter and determined conflict between the great adversaries is a sluggish and winding stream which rising above richmond describes a curve around it and * its waters into the james far below the city its banks are swampy and thickly clothed with forest or underwood from the nature of these banks which scarcely rise in many places above the level of the water the least freshet produces an overflow and the stream generally narrow and insignificant becomes a sort of lake covering the low grounds to the bases of the wooded bluffs extending upon each side numerous bridges cross the stream from bottoms bridge below the york river railroad to meadow bridge north of the city of these the mechanicsville bridge about four miles from the city and the new bridge about nine miles were points of the greatest importance general mcclellans position has been repeatedly referred to he had crossed a portion of his army east of richmond and advanced to within four or five miles of the city the remainder meanwhile lay on the north bank of the stream and swept round in a sort of crescent to the vicinity of mechanicsville where it had been anticipated general mcdowell would unite with it thereby covering its right flank and protecting the communications with the federal base at the white house that this disposition of the federal troops was faulty in face of adversaries like johnston and lee there could be no doubt but general mcclellan was the victim it seems of the shifting and * policy of the authorities at washington with the arrival of the forty thousand men under mcdowell his position would have been a safe one general mcdowell did not arrive and this unprotected right * unprotected from the fact that mcdowells presence was counted * the point of the confederate attack the amount of blame if any justly attributable to general mcclellan first for his inactivity and then for his defeat by lee cannot be referred to here save in a few brief sentences a sort of feud seems to have arisen between himself and general halleck the commanderinchief stationed at washington and general halleck then and afterward appears to have regarded mcclellan as a soldier without decision or broad generalship and yet mcclellan does not seem to have merited the censure he received he called persistently for reinforcements remaining inactive meanwhile because he estimated the confederate army before him at two hundred thousand men and was unwilling to assail this force under command of soldiers like johnston and lee until his own force seemed adequate to the undertaking another consideration was the confederate position in front of the powerful earthworks of the city these works would double the confederate strength in case of battle in front of them and believing himself already outnumbered the federal commander was naturally loath to deliver battle until renforced the faulty disposition of his army divided by a stream crossed by few bridges has been accounted for in like * so disposed the troops expecting renforcements but jacksons energy delayed these washington was in danger it was supposed and general mcdowell did not come it thus happened that general mcclellan awaited attack instead of making it and that his army was so posted as to expose him to the greatest peril a last point is to be noted in vindication of this able soldier finding at the very last moment that he could expect no further assistance from the president or general halleck he resolved promptly to withdraw his exposed right wing and change his base of operations to james river where at least his communications would be safe this it seems had been determined upon just before the confederate attack or if he had not then decided general mcclellan soon determined upon that plan to pass now to the confederate side where all was ready for the great movement general lees army lay in front of richmond exactly corresponding with the front of general mcclellan the divisions of magruder and huger supported by those of longstreet and dh hill were opposite mcclellans left on the williamsburg and york river roads directly east of the city from magruders left extended the division of general ap hill reaching thence up the river toward mechanicsville and a brigade under general branch lay on hills left near the point where the brook turnpike crosses the chickahominy north of richmond the approaches from the east northeast and north were thus carefully guarded as the confederates held the interior line the whole force could be rapidly concentrated and was thoroughly in hand both for offensive or defensive movements the army thus held in lees grasp and about to assail its great federal adversary was composed of the best portion of the southern population the rank and file was largely made up of men of education and high social position and this resulted from the character of the struggle the war was a war of invasion on the part of the north and the ardent and highspirited youth of the entire south threw themselves into it with enthusiasm the heirs of ancient families and great wealth served as privates personal pride love of country indignation at the thought that a hostile section had sent an army to reduce them to submission combined to draw into the confederate ranks the flower of the southern youth and all the best fighting material deficient in discipline and hard to manage this force was yet of the most efficient character it could be counted on for hard work and especially for offensive operations and the officers placed over it shared its character among these general ap hill a virginian by birth was soon to be conspicuous as commander of the light division and representative of the spirit and dash and enthusiasm of the army under forty years of age with a slender figure a * face dark eyes a composed and unassuming bearing characterized when off duty by a quiet cordiality he was personally popular with all who approached him and greatly beloved both as man and commander his chief merit as a soldier was his dash and impetus in the charge a braver heart never beat in human breast throughout the war he retained the respect and admiration of the army and the country and a strange fact in relation to this eminent soldier is that his name was uttered by both jackson and lee as they expired associated with him in the battles of the chickahominy and to the end was the able and resolute * officer of low and powerful stature with a heavy brown beard reaching to his breast a manner marked by unalterable composure and a countenance whose expression of phlegmatic tranquillity never varied in the hottest hours of battle longstreet was as famous for his bulldog obstinacy as hill for his dash and enthusiasm general lee styled him his old warhorse and depended upon him as will be seen in some of the most critical operations of the war of the young and ardent virginian general magruder the brave and resolute * dh hill and other officers who subsequently acquired great * in the army we have no space at present to speak all were to coperate in the assault on general mcclellan and do their part on the night of the 25th of june all was ready for the important movement and the troops rested on their arms ready for the coming battle general lee had been hitherto regarded as a soldier of too great caution but his plan for the assault on general mcclellan indicated the possession of a nerve approaching audacity fully comprehending his enemys strength and position and aware that a large portion of the federal army had crossed the chickahominy and was directly in his front he had resolved to pass to the north bank of the stream with the bulk of his force leaving only about twentyfive thousand men to protect the city and deliver battle where defeat would prove ruinous this plan indicated nothing less than audacity as we have already said but like the audacity of the flank movement at chancellorsville afterward and the daring march in disregard of general hooker to pennsylvania in 1864 it was founded on profound military insight and indicated the qualities of a great soldier lees design was to attack the federal right wing with a part of his force while jackson advancing still farther to the left came in on their communications with the white house and assailed them on their right and rear meanwhile richmond was to be protected by general magruder with his twentyfive thousand men on the south bank if mcclellan fell back down the peninsula this force was to cross and unite with the rest thus the federal army would be driven from all its positions and the fate of the whole campaign against richmond would be decided lees general order directing the movement of the troops is here given it possesses interest as a clear and detailed statement of his intended operations and it will be seen that what was resolved on by the commander in his tent his able subordinates translated detail by detail with unimportant modifications into action under his eyes in the field this order speaks for itself and indicates lees plan of battle in all its details further comment is unnecessary and we proceed to narrate the events which followed in doing so we shall strive to present a clear and intelligible account of what occurred rather than to indulge in the warlike * of style which characterized the army correspondents of the journals during the war such a treatment of the subject is left to others who write under the influence of partisan * rather than with the judicious moderation of the historian nor are battles themselves the subjects of greatest interest to the thoughtful student the combinations devised by great commanders are of more interest than the actual struggles we have therefore dwelt at greater length upon the plans of generals lee and mcclellan than we shall dwell upon the actual fighting of their armies on the morning of the 26th of june 1862 all was ready for the great encounter of arms between the confederates and the federal forces on the chickahominy general jackson had been delayed on his march from the mountains and had not yet arrived but it was known that he was near and would soon make his appearance and in the afternoon general lee accordingly directed that the movement should commence at the word general ap hill moved from his camps to meadow bridge north of richmond crossed the chickahominy there and moved rapidly on mechanicsville where a small federal force behind intrenchments guarded the head of the bridge this force was not a serious obstacle and hill soon disposed of it he attacked the federal works stormed them after a brief struggle and drove the force which had occupied them back toward beaver dam creek below the mechanicsville bridge was thus cleared and in compliance with his orders from lee general longstreet hastened to throw his division across hill had meanwhile pressed forward on the track of the retreating enemy and a mile or two below found himself in front of a much more serious obstruction than that encountered at the bridge namely the formidable position held by the enemy on beaver dam creek the ground here is of a peculiar character and admirably adapted for a defensive position against an enemy advancing from above on the opposite side of a narrow valley through which runs beaver dam creek rises a bold almost * bluff and the road which the confederates were compelled to take bends abruptly to the right when near the stream thus exposing the flank of the assaulting party to a fire from the bluff as hills column pushed forward to attack this position it was met by a determined fire of artillery and smallarms from the crest beyond the stream where a large force of riflemen in pits were posted with infantry supports before this artilleryfire raking his flanks and doing heavy execution hill was compelled to fall back it was impossible to cross the stream in face of the fusillade and cannon the attack ended after dark with the withdrawal of the confederates but at dawn hill resumed the struggle attempting to cross at another point lower down the stream this attempt was in progress when the federal troops were seen rapidly falling back from their strong position and intelligence soon came that this was in consequence of the arrival of jackson who had passed around the federal right flank above and forced them to retire toward the main body of the federal army below no time was now lost the memorable 27th of june had dawned clear and cloudless and the brilliant sunshine gave promise of a day on which no interference of the elements would check the bloody work to be performed hill advanced steadily on the track of the retiring federal forces who had left evidences of their precipitate retreat all along the road and about noon came in front of the very powerful position of the main body of the enemy near cold harbor general mcclellan had drawn up his forces on a ridge along the southern bank of * creek a small watercourse which flowing from the northeast * below new bridge into the chickahominy his left nearest the chickahominy was protected by a deep ravine in front which he had filled with sharpshooters and his right rested upon elevated ground near the locality known as * house in front the whole line of battle which described a curve backward to cover the bridges in rear was protected by difficult approaches the ground was either swampy or covered with tangled undergrowth or both the ridge held by the federal forces had been hastily fortified by breastworks of felled trees and earth behind which the long lines of infantry supported by numerous artillery awaited the attack the amount of the federal force has been variously stated the impression of the confederates differed from the subsequent statements of federal writers the principal part of the federal army says general lee in his report was now on the north side of the chickahominy the force has been placed by northern writers at only thirty or at most thirtyfive thousand if this was the whole number of troops engaged from first to last in the battle the fact is highly creditable to the federal arms as the struggle was long doubtful no doubt the exact truth will some day be put upon record and justice will be done to both the adversaries the federal force was commanded by the brave and able general fitzjohn porter with general morell commanding his right general sykes his left and general mccall forming a second line slocums division and the brigades of generals french and meagher afterward renforced porter who now prepared with great coolness for the confederate attack the moment had come ap hill pressing forward rapidly with longstreets division on the right reached cold harbor in front of the federal centre about noon hill immediately attacked and an engagement of the most obstinate character ensued general lee accompanied by general longstreet had ridden from his headquarters on the ninemile road to the scene of action and now witnessed in person the fighting of the troops who charged under his eye closing in in a nearly handtohand conflict with the enemy this was no doubt the first occasion on which a considerable portion of the men had seen * in battleand that air of supreme calmness which always characterized him in action must have made a deep impression upon them he was clad simply and wore scarcely any badges of rank a felt hat drooped low over the broad forehead and the eyes beneath were calm and unclouded add a voice of measured calmness the air of immovable composure which marked the erect military figure evidently at home in the saddle and the reader will have a correct conception of general lees personal appearance in the first of the great battles of his career hill attacked with that dash and obstinacy which from this time forward characterized him but succeeded in making no impression on the federal line in every assault he was repulsed with heavy loss the federal artillery which was handled with skill and coolness did great execution upon his column as it rushed forward and the infantry behind their works stood firm in spite of the most determined efforts to drive them from the ridge three of hills regiments reached the crest and fought hand to hand over the breastworks but they were speedily repulsed and driven from the crest and after two hours hard fighting hill found that he had lost heavily and effected nothing it was now past two oclock in the afternoon and general lee listened with anxiety for the sound of guns from the left which would herald the approach of general jackson nothing was heard from that quarter however and affairs were growing critical the confederate attack had been * federal position seemed * it became apparent says general lee that the enemy were gradually gaining ground under these circumstances general mcclellan might adopt either one of the two courses both alike dangerous to the confederates he might cross a heavy force to the assistance of general porter thus enabling that officer to assume the offensive or finding lee thus checked he might advance on magruder crush the small force under him and seize on richmond which would be at his mercy it was thus necessary to act without delay while awaiting the appearance of jackson general lee accordingly directed general longstreet who had taken position to the right of cold harbor to make a feint against the federal left and thus relieve the pressure on hill longstreet proceeded with promptness to obey the order advanced in face of a heavy fire and with a crossfire of artillery raking his right from over the chickahominy and made the feint which had been ordered by general lee it effected nothing and to attain the desired result it was found necessary to turn the feint into a real attack this longstreet proceeded to do first * with a single volley a force of cavalry which had the temerity to charge his infantry as he advanced and attacked the powerful position before him the roar of guns succeeded by loud cheers was heard on the left of lees line jackson had arrived and thrown his troops into action without delay he then rode forward to cold harbor where general lee awaited him and the two soldiers shook hands in the midst of tumultuous cheering from the troops who had received intelligence that jacksons corps had joined them the contrast between the two men was extremely striking we have presented a brief sketch of lees personal appearance upon the * the grave commanderinchief with his erect and graceful seat in the saddle his imposing dignity of demeanor and his calm and measured tones as deliberate as though he were in a drawingroom jackson was a very different personage he was clad in a dingy old coat wore a discolored * tilted almost upon his nose and rode a rawboned horse with short stirrups which raised his knees in the most ungraceful manner neither in his face nor figure was there the least indication of the great faculties of the man and a more * personage it would be impossible to imagine in his hand he held a lemon which he * from time to time and his demeanor was abstracted and absent as jackson approached lee rode toward him and greeted him with a cordial pressure of the hand ah general said lee i am very glad to see you i hoped to be with you before jackson made a twitching movement of his head and replied in a few words rather jerked from the lips than deliberately uttered lee had paused and now listened attentively to the long roll of musketry from the woods where hill and longstreet were engaged then to the still more incessant and angry roar from the direction of jacksons own troops who had closed in upon the federal forces that fire is very heavy said lee do you think your men can stand it jackson listened for a moment with his head bent toward one shoulder as was customary with him for he was deaf he said in one ear and could not hear out of the other and replied briefly they can stand almost any thing they can stand that he then after receiving general lees instructions immediately saluted and returned to his * remaining still at cold harbor which was opposite the federal centre the arrival of jackson changed in a moment the aspect of affairs in every part of the field * division of his command took position on longstreets left the command of general dh hill on the extreme right of the whole line and ewells division with part of jacksons old division supported ap hill no sooner had these dispositions been made than general lee ordered an attack along the whole line it was now five or six oclock and the sun was sinking from that moment until night came the battle raged with a fury unsurpassed in any subsequent engagement of the war the texan troops under general hood especially distinguished themselves these followed by their comrades charged the federal left on the bluff and in spite of a desperate resistance carried the position the enemy were driven says general lee from the ravine to the first line of breastworks over which one impetuous column dashed up to the intrenchments on the crest here the federal artillery was captured their line driven from the hill and in other parts of the field a similar success followed the attack as night fell their line gave way in all parts and the remnants of general porters command retreated to the bridges over the chickahominy the first important passage of arms between general mcclellan and general * it may be added the really decisive * terminated in a great success on the side of the confederates the battle of cold * as general lee styles it in his report the battle of the * the decisive struggle between the great adversaries and determined the fate of general mcclellans campaign against richmond this view is not held by writers on the northern side who represent the battle in question as only the first of a series of engagements all of pretty nearly equal importance and mere incidents attending general mcclellans change of base to the shores of the james river such a theory seems unfounded if the battle at cold harbor had resulted in a federal victory general mcclellan would have advanced straight on richmond and the capture of the city would inevitably have followed but at cold harbor he sustained a decisive defeat his whole campaign was reversed and came to naught from the events occurring between noon and nightfall on the 27th of june the result of that obstinate encounter was not a federal success leading to the fall of richmond but a federal defeat which led to the retreat to the james river and the failure of the whole campaign against the confederate capital it is conceded that general mcclellan really intended to change his base but after the battle of cold harbor every thing had changed he no longer had under him a highspirited army moving to take up a stronger position but a weary and dispirited multitude of human beings hurrying along to gain the shelter of the gunboats on the james river with the enemy pursuing closely and worrying them at every step to the condition of the federal army one of their own officers * and his expressions are so strong as wellnigh to move the * of an opponent we were ordered to retreat says general hooker and it was like the retreat of a whipped army we retreated like a parcel of sheep everybody on the road at the same time and a few shots from the rebels would have panicstricken the whole command such was the condition of that great army which had fought so bravely standing firm so long against the headlong assaults of the flower of the southern troops it was the battle at cold harbor which had produced this state of things thereby really deciding the result of the campaign to attribute to that action therefore no more importance than attached to the engagements on the retreat to james river seems in opposition to the truth of history we shall present only a general narrative of the famous retreat which reflected the highest credit upon general mcclellan and will remain his greatest glory he at least was too good a soldier not to understand that the battle of the 27th was a decisive one he determined to retreat without risking another action to the banks of the james river where the federal gunboats would render a second attack from the confederates a hazardous undertaking and on the evening of the 27th of june as he says in his official report assembled the corps commanders at his headquarters and informed them of his plan its reasons and his choice of route and method of execution orders were then issued to general keyes to move with his corps across the whiteoak swamp bridge and taking up a position with his artillery on the opposite side cover the passage of the rest of the troops the trains and supplies at savage station on the york river railroad were directed to be withdrawn and the corps commanders were ordered to move with such provisions munitions and sick as they could transport on the direct road to harrisons landing these orders were promptly carried out before dawn on the 29th the federal army took up the line of march and the great retrograde movement was successfully begun an immense obstacle to its success lay in the character of the country through which it was necessary to pass white oak swamp is an extensive * similar to that * the banks of the chickahominy and the passage through it is over narrow winding and difficult roads which furnish the worst possible * for wagons artillery or even troops it was necessary however to use these highways or none and general mcclellan resolutely entered upon his critical movement general lee was yet in doubt as to his opponents designs and the fact is highly creditable to general mcclellan a portion of the federal army still remained on the left bank of the chickahominy and it might be the intention of mcclellan to push forward renforcements from the peninsula fight a second battle for the protection of his great mass of supplies at the white house or crossing his whole army to the left bank of the chickahominy by the lower bridges retreat down the peninsula by the same road followed in advancing all that general lee could do under these circumstances was to remain near cold harbor with his main body send a force toward the york river road on the eastern bank of the chickahominy to check any federal attempt to cross there and await further developments it was not until the morning of the 29th that general mcclellans designs became apparent it was then ascertained that he had commenced moving toward james river with his entire army and lee issued prompt orders for the pursuit while a portion of the confederate army followed closely upon the enemys rear other bodies were directed to move by the williamsburg and charles city roads and intercept him or assail his flanks if these movements were promptly made and no unnecessary delay took place it was expected that the federal army would be brought to bay in the whiteoak swamp and a final victory be achieved by the confederates these complicated movements were soon in full progress and at various points on the line of retreat fierce fighting ensued general magruder advancing to savage station an important depot of federal stores on the york river railroad encountered on the 29th the powerful federal rearguard which fought obstinately until night when it retired next day generals longstreet and ap hill had pushed down the long bridge road and on the next day june 30th came on the retreating column which was vigorously engaged from the character of the ground little however was effected the enemy fought with obstinate courage and repulsed every assault the battle raged until after nightfall when the federal army continued to retreat these actions were the most important and in both the confederates had failed to effect any important results even jackson who had been delayed by the destruction of the chickahominy bridges in crossing to the south bank from the vicinity of cold harbor and had followed in rear of the rest of the army found himself checked by general mcclellans admirable disposition for the protection of his rear jackson made every effort to strike a decisive blow at the federal rear in the whiteoak swamp but he found a bridge in his front destroyed the enemy holding the opposite side in strong force and when he endeavored to force a passage the determined fire from their artillery rendered it impossible for him to do so general mcclellan had thus foiled the generalship of lee and the hard fighting of stonewall jackson his excellent military judgement had defeated every attempt made to crush him on the 1st of july he had successfully passed the terrible swamp in spite of all his enemies and his army was drawn up on the wellnigh impregnable heights of malvern hill a last struggle took place at malvern hill and the confederate assault failed at all points owing to the wooded nature of the ground and the absence of accurate information in regard to it the attack was made under very great difficulties and effected nothing the federal troops resisted courageously and inflicted heavy loss upon the assailing force which advanced to the muzzles of the federal cannon but did not carry the heights and at nightfall the battle ceased the confederates having suffered a severe repulse on the next morning general mcclellan had disappeared toward harrisons landing to which he conducted his army safely without further molestation and the long and bitter struggle was over we have presented a sufficiently full narrative of the great battles of the chickahominy to enable the reader to form his own opinion of the events and the capacity of the two leaders who directed them full justice has been sought to be done to the eminent military abilities of general mcclellan and the writer is not conscious that he has done more than justice to general lee lee has not escaped criticism and was blamed by many persons for not putting an end to the federal army on the retreat through whiteoak swamp to this criticism it may be said in reply that putting an end to nearly or quite one hundred thousand men is a difficult undertaking and that in one instance at least the failure of one of his subordinates in arriving promptly reversed his plans at the most critical moment of the struggle general lee himself however states the main cause of failure under ordinary circumstances he says the federal army should have been destroyed its escape is due to the causes already stated prominent among them is the want of timely and correct information this fact attributed chiefly to the character of the country enabled general mcclellan skilfully to conceal his retreat and to add much to the obstruction with which nature had beset the way of our pursuing columns but regret that more was not accomplished gives way to gratitude to the sovereign ruler of the universe for the results achieved the reader will form his own opinion whether lee was or was not to blame for this want of accurate information which would seem however to be justly attributable to the war department at richmond rather than to an officer who had been assigned to command only three or four weeks before other criticisms of lee referred to his main plan of operations and the danger to which he exposed richmond by leaving only twentyfive thousand men in front of it when he began his movement against general mcclellans right wing beyond the chickahominy general magruder who commanded this force of twentyfive thousand men left to guard the capital expressed afterward in his official report his views of the danger to which the city had been exposed he wrote from the time at which the enemy withdrew his forces to this side of the chickahominy and destroyed the bridges to the moment of his evacuation that is from friday night until saturday morning i considered the situation of our army as extremely critical and perilous the larger portion of it was on the opposite side of the chickahominy the bridges had been all destroyed but one was * new * was commanded fully by the enemys guns from * and there were but twentyfive thousand men between his army of one hundred thousand and richmond had mcclellan massed his whole force in column and advanced it against any point of our line of battle as was done at * under similar circumstances by the greatest captain of any age though the head of his column would have suffered greatly its * would have insured him success and the occupation of our works about richmond and consequently the city might have been his reward his failure to do so is the best evidence that our wise commander fully understood the character of his opponent to this portion of general magruders report general lee appended the following remarks in forwarding it general magruder is under a misapprehension as to the separation of troops operating on the north side of the chickahominy from those under himself and general huger on the south side he refers to this subject on pages 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 of his report the troops on the two sides of the river were only separated until we succeeded in occupying the position near what is known as new bridge which occurred before twelve oclock m on friday june 27th and before the attack on the enemy at gainess mill from the time we reached the position referred to i regarded communication between the two wings of our army as * the bridge referred to and another about threequarters of a mile above were ordered to be repaired before noon on friday and the new bridge was sufficiently rebuilt to be passed by artillery on friday night and the one above it was used for the passage of wagons ambulances and troops early on saturday morning besides this all other bridges above new bridge and all the fords above that point were open to us to this general magruder subsequently responded as follows new bridge was finished on friday evening the 27th instead of saturday 28th of june i wrote from memory in reference to the time of its being finished it was reported to me that the bridge threequarters of a mile above was attempted to be crossed by troops i think ransoms brigade on saturday morning from the south to the north side but that finding the bridge or the approach to it difficult they came down and crossed at new bridge on the same morning my statement in regard to these bridges was not intended as a criticism on general lees plan but to show the position of the troops with a view to the proper understanding of my report and to prove that the enemy might have reasonably entertained a design after concentrating his troops to march on richmond we shall not detain the reader by entering upon a full discussion of the interesting question here raised general lee as his observations on general magruders report show did not regard richmond as exposed to serious danger and was confident of his ability to recross the chickahominy and go to its succor in the event of an attack on the city by general mcclellan had this prompt recrossing of the stream here even been impracticable it may still be a question whether general lee did not in his movement against the federal right wing with the bulk of his army follow the dictates of sound generalship in war something must be risked and occasions arise which render it necessary to disregard general maxims it is one of the first principles of military science that a commander should always keep open his line of retreat but the moment may come when his best policy is to burn the bridges behind him of lees movement against general mcclellans right it may be said that it was based on the broadest good sense and the best generalship the situation of affairs rendered an attack in some quarter essential to the safety of the capital which was about to be hemmed in on all sides to attack the left of general mcclellan promised small results it had been tried and had failed his right alone remained it was possible certainly that he would mass his army and crushing magruder march into richmond but it was not probable that he would make the attempt the federal commander was known to be a soldier disposed to caution rather than audacity the small amount of force under general magruder was a secret which he could not be expected to know that general lee took these facts into consideration as general magruder intimates may or may not have been the fact and the whole discussion may be fairly summed up perhaps by saying that success vindicated the course adopted success after all is the test of merit said the brave albert sydney johnston and talleyrand compressed much sound reasoning in the pithy maxim nothing succeeds like success on the 2d of july the campaign was over and general mcclellan must have felt in spite of his hopeful general orders to the troops and dispatches to his government that the great struggle for richmond had virtually ended a week before he had occupied a position within a few miles of the city with a numerous army in the highest spirits and of thorough efficiency now he lay on the banks of james river thirty miles away from the capital and his army was worn out by the tremendous ordeal it had passed through and completely discouraged we have not dwelt upon the horrors of the retreat and the state of the army which northern writers painted at the time in the gloomiest colors for the moment it was no longer the splendid * it had been and was again afterward nothing could be done with it and general mcclellan knew the fact without fresh troops a renewed advance upon richmond was a mere dream no further attack was made by general lee who remained for some days inactive in the hot forests of charles city his reasons for * from a new assault on general mcclellan are summed up in one or two sentences of his report the federal commander he says immediately began to fortify his position which was one of great natural strength flanked on each side by a creek and the approach to his front commanded by the heavy guns of his shipping in addition to those mounted in his intrenchments it was deemed inexpedient to attack him and in view of the condition of our troops who had been marching and fighting almost incessantly for seven days under the most trying circumstances it was determined to withdraw in order to afford them the repose of which they stood so much in need on the 8th of july general lee accordingly directed his march back toward richmond and the troops went into camp and rested general lee had thus at the outset of his career as commander of the confederate army saved the capital by a blow at the enemy as sudden as it was resistless the class of persons who are never satisfied and delight in faultfinding under all circumstances declared that a great general would have crushed the enemy on their retreat these certainly were in a minority the people at large greeted lee as the author of a great deliverance worked out for them and on his return to richmond he was received with every mark of gratitude and honor he accepted this public ovation with the moderation and dignity which characterized his demeanor afterward under all circumstances either of victory or defeat it was almost impossible to discover in his bearing at this time as on other great occasions any evidences whatever of elation success like disaster seemed to find him calm collected and as nearly * as is possible for a human being the character of the man led him to look upon success or failure with this supreme composure which nothing seemed able to shake but in july 1862 he probably understood that the confederate states were still as far as ever from having achieved the objects of the war general mcclellan had been defeated in battle but the great resources of the united states government would enable it promptly to put other and larger armies in the field even the defeated army was still numerous and dangerous for it consisted according to mcclellans report of nearly or quite ninety thousand men and the wise brain of its commander had devised a plan of future operations which promised far greater results than the advance on richmond from the chickahominy we shall touch in passing on this interesting subject but shall first ask the readers attention to a communication addressed by general mcclellan at this time to president lincoln it is one of those papers which belong to history and should be placed upon record it not only throws the clearest light on the character and views of general lees great adversary but expresses with admirable * the sentiments of a large portion of the federal people at the time the president had invited a statement of general mcclellans views on the conduct of the war and on july 7th in the very midst of the scenes of disaster at harrisons landing mcclellan wrote these * words this rebellion has assumed the character of a war as such it should be regarded and it should be conducted upon the highest principles know to christian civilization it should not be a war looking to the subjugation of the people of any state in any event it should not be at all a war upon population but against armed forces and political organization neither confiscation of property political * territorial organizations of states nor forcible abolition of slavery should be contemplated for a moment in prosecuting the war all private property and unarmed persons should be strictly protected subject only to the necessity of military operations all private property taken for military use should be paid or * for pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes all unnecessary trespass sternly prohibited and offensive demeanor by the military toward citizens promptly rebuked military arrests should not be tolerated except in places where active hostilities exist and oaths not required by enactments constitutionally made should be neither demanded nor received military government should be confined to the preservation of public order and the protection of political right military power should not be allowed to interfere with the relations of servitude either by supporting or * the authority of the master except for * disorder as in other cases slaves contraband under the act of congress seeking military protection should receive it the right of the government to appropriate permanently to its own service claims to * should be asserted and the right of the owner to compensation therefor should be recognized this principle might be extended upon grounds of military necessity and security to all the slaves of a particular state thus working manumission in such state and in missouri perhaps in western virginia also and possibly even in maryland the expediency of such a measure is only a question of time a system of policy thus constitutional and pervaded by the influences of christianity and freedom would receive the support of almost all truly loyal men would deeply impress the rebel masses and all foreign nations and it might be humbly hoped that it would commend itself to the favor of the almighty unless the principles governing the future conduct of our struggle shall be made known and approved the effort to obtain requisite forces will be almost hopeless a declaration of radical views especially upon slavery will rapidly * our present armies the policy of the government must be supported by * of military power the national forces should not be dispersed in expeditions posts of occupation and numerous armies but should be mainly collected into masses and brought to bear upon the armies of the confederate states those armies thoroughly defeated the political structure which they support would soon cease to exist this noble and earnest exposition of his opinion upon the proper mode of conducting the war will reflect honor upon general mcclellan when his military achievements are forgotten it * the situation of affairs both from the political and military point of view in a spirit of the broadest statesmanship and with the acumen of a great soldier that it had no effect is the clearest indication upon which the war was thenceforward to be conducted the removal of general mcclellan as holding views opposed to the party in power is said to have resulted from this communication it certainly placed him in open antagonism to general halleck the federal secretary of war and as this antagonism had a direct effect upon even connected with the subject of our memoir we shall briefly relate now it was now displayed defeated on the chickahominy and seeing little to encourage an advance on the left bank of the james upon richmond general mcclellan proposed to cross that river and operate against the capital and its communications near petersburg the proof of mcclellans desire to undertake this movement which afterward proved so successful under general grant is found in a memorandum by general halleck himself of what took place on a visit paid by him to mcclellan at harrisons landing on july 25 1862 i stated to him says general halleck that the object of my visit was to ascertain from him his views and wishes in regard to future operations he said that he proposed to cross the james river at that point attack petersburg and cut off the enemys communications by that route south making no further demonstration for the present against richmond i stated to him very frankly my views in regard to the manner and * of the plan and nothing further it seems was said of this highly impracticable plan of operations it became practicable afterward under general grant mcclellan was not permitted to essay it in july 1862 from the fact that it had been resolved to relieve him from command or from general * inability to perceive its good sense general lees views upon this subject coincided completely with those of general mcclellan he expressed at this time to those in his confidence the opinion that richmond could be assailed to greater advantage from the south as a movement of the enemy in that direction would menace her communications with the gulf states and events subsequently proved the * of this view attacks from all other quarters failed including a repetition by general grant of mcclellans attempt from the side of the chickahominy when general grant carried out his predecessors plan of assailing the city from the direction of petersburg he succeeded in putting an end to the war general lee remained in front of richmond watching general mcclellan but intelligence soon reached him from the upper rappahannock that another army was advancing in that quarter and had already occupied the county of culpepper with the obvious intention of capturing gordonsville the point of junction of the orange and alexandria and virginia central railroads and advancing thence upon richmond the great defeat on the chickahominy had only inspired the federal authorities with new energy three hundred thousand new troops were called for large bounties were held out as an inducement to enlistment * in regions occupied by the united states armies were directed to be enrolled as troops and military commanders were authorized to seize upon whatever was necessary or convenient for their commands without compensation to the owners this indicated the policy upon which it was now intended to conduct the war and the army occupying culpepper proceeded to carry out the new policy in every particular this force consisted of the troops which had served under generals banks mcdowell and * * renforcements from the army of mcclellan together with the troops under general burnside were hastening to unite with the * army it was styled the army of virginia and was placed under command of majorgeneral john pope who had hitherto served in the west general pope had procured the command it is said by impressing the authorities with a high opinion of his energy and activity in these qualities general mcclellan was supposed to be deficient and the new commander coming from a region where the war was conducted on a different plan it was said would be able to infuse new life into the languid movements in virginia general pope had taken special pains to allay the fears of the federal authorities for the safety of washington he intended to lie off on the flanks of lees army he said and render it impossible for the rebels to advance upon the capital while he occupied that threatening position when asked if with an army like general mcclellans he would find any difficulty in marching through the south to new orleans general pope replied without hesitation i should suppose not this confident view of things seems to have procured general pope his appointment and it will soon be seen that he proceeded to conduct military operations upon principles very different from those announced by general mcclellan war as carried on by general pope was to be war * general mcclellan had written the war should not be at all a war upon population but against armed forces all private property taken for military use should be paid for pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes all unnecessary trespass sternly prohibited and offensive demeanor by the military toward citizens promptly rebuked the new commander intended to act upon a very different principle and to show that he possessed more activity and resolution than his predecessor general popes assumption of the command was signalized by much pomp and animated general orders he arrived in a train decked out with streamers and issued an order in which he said to the troops i desire you to dismiss from your minds certain phrases which i am sorry to find much in vogue among you i hear constantly of taking strong positions and holding them of lines of retreat and bases of supplies let us * such ideas the strongest position which a soldier should desire to occupy is the one from which he can most easily advance upon the enemy let us study the probable line of retreat of our opponents and leave our own to take care of itself let us look before and not behind disaster and shame look in the rear the result as will be seen furnished a grotesque commentary upon that portion of general popes order which we have * in an address to the army he added further i have come to you from the west where we have always seen the backs of our * an army whose business it has been to seek the adversary and beat him when * policy has been attack and not defence i presume i have been called here to pursue the same system such was the tenor of general popes orders on assuming * which were either intended seriously as an announcement of his real intentions or as a blind to persuade the confederates that his force was large unfortunately for the region in which he now came to operate general pope did not confine himself to these * of * he proceeded to inaugurate a military policy in vivid contrast to general mcclellans his * orders directed that all male citizens disloyal to the united states should be immediately arrested the oath of allegiance to the united states government should be proffered them and if they furnished sufficient security for its observance they should be set free again if they refused the oath they should be sent beyond the federal lines and if afterward found within his lines they should be treated as spies and shot their property to be seized and applied to the public use all communication with persons living within the southern lines was forbidden such communication should subject the individual guilty of it to be treated as a spy lastly general popes subordinates were directed to arrest prominent citizens and hold them as hostages for the good behavior of the population if his soldiers were * is to say attacked on their foraging * prominent citizens thus held as hostages were to suffer death it is obvious that war carried on upon such principles is rapine general pope ventured however upon the new programme and a foreign periodical commenting upon the result declared that this commander had prosecuted hostilities against the south in a way that cast mankind two centuries back toward barbarism we shall not pause to view the great outrages committed by the federal troops in culpepper they have received thus much comment rather to introduce the following communication to the federal authorities from general lee than to record what is known now to the old world as well as the new profoundly outraged and indignant at these cruel and oppressive acts general lee by direction of the confederate authorities addressed on the 2d of august the following note to general halleck this communication requires no comment it had the desired effect although general halleck returned it as couched in language too insulting to be received on the 15th of august the united states war department so far disapproved of general popes orders as to direct that no officer or soldier might without proper authority leave his colors or ranks to take private property or to enter a private house for the purpose under penalty of death general pope had promptly advanced and his army lay in culpepper the right reaching toward the blue ridge and the left extending nearly to the rapidan the campaign now became a contest of brains between lee and the federal authorities their obvious aim was to leave him in doubt whether a new advance was intended under mcclellan from james river or the real movement was to be against richmond from the north under these circumstances general lee remained with the bulk of his army in front of richmond but on the 13th of july sent jackson with two divisions in the direction of gordonsville the game of wits had thus begun and general lee moved cautiously looking in both directions toward james river and the upper rappahannock as yet the real design of the enemy was undeveloped the movement of general pope might or might not be a real advance but general mcclellan remained inactive and on the 27th of july ap hills division was sent up to renforce * at the same time general dh hill commanding a force on the south bank of the james river was directed to make demonstrations against mcclellans communications by opening fire on his transports the moment approached now when the game between the two adversaries was to be decided on the 2d of august jackson assumed the offensive by attacking the enemy at orange courthouse and on the 5th general mcclellan made a prompt demonstration to prevent lee from sending him further reinforcements a large federal force advanced to malvern hill and was drawn up there in line of battle with every indication on the part of general mcclellan of an intention to advance anew upon richmond lee promptly went to meet him and a slight engagement ensued on curls neck but on the next morning the federal army had disappeared and the whole movement was seen to have been a feint this state of indecision continued until nearly the middle of august an incident then occurred which clearly indicated the enemys intentions general burnside was known to have reached hampton roads from the southern coast with a considerable force and the direction which his flotilla now took would show the design of the federal authorities if a new advance was intended from the james the flotilla would ascend that river if general popes army was looked to for the real movement general burnside would go in that direction the secret was discovered by the afterward celebrated colonel john s mosby then a private and just returned by way of fortress monroe from prison in washington he ascertained when he * that burnsides flotilla was about to move toward the rappahannock and aware of the importance of the information hastened to communicate it to general lee he was admitted at the headquarters of the latter near richmond to a private interview and when general lee had finished his conversation with the * individual then almost unknown he was in possession of the information necessary to determine his plans the rappahannock and not the james was seen to be the theatre of the coming campaign and general lees whole attention was now directed to that quarter jackson had already struck an important blow there coperating vigorously as was habitual with him in the general plan of action general mcclellan had endeavored by a feint to hold lee at richmond by a battle now jackson hastened the retreat of the army under mcclellan from james river with his three divisions jackson crossed the rapidan and on the 9th of august attacked the advance force of general pope at cedar mountain the struggle was obstinate and at one time jacksons left was driven back but the action terminated at nightfall in the retreat of the federal forces and the confederate commander remained in possession of the field he was too weak however to hold his position against the main body of the federal army which was known to be approaching he accordingly recrossed the rapidan to the vicinity of gordonsville and here he was soon afterward joined by general lee with the great bulk of the confederate army such were the events which succeeded the battles of the chickahominy transferring hostilities to a new theatre and * the great campaigns of the summer and autumn of 1862 in northern virginia and maryland general lee it will thus be seen had proceeded in his military manoeuvres with the utmost caution determined to give his adversaries no advantage and remain in front of the capital until it was free from all danger but for the daring assault upon general mcclellan on the chickahominy his critics would no doubt have charged him with weakness and indecision now but under any circumstances it is certain that he would have proceeded in the same manner conducting operations in the method which his judgment approved at length the necessity of caution had disappeared general burnside had gone to renforce general pope and a portion of mcclellans army was believed to have followed it therefore seemed says general lee that active operations on the james were no longer contemplated and he wisely concluded that the most effectual way to relieve richmond from any danger of attack from that quarter would be to renforce general jackson and advance upon general pope in commenting upon these words an able writer of the north * * prophecy showing that insight which is one of the highest marks of generalship the movement indeed was the right proceeding as the event showed and good generalship may be defined to be the power of seeing what is the proper course and the decision of character which leads to its adoption general lee exhibited throughout his career this mingled good judgment and daring and his cautious inactivity was now succeeded by one of those offensive movements which if we may judge him by his subsequent career seemed to be the natural bent of his character with the bulk of his army he marched in the direction of general pope the rest were speedily ordered to follow and active operations began for driving the * federal army of virginia back toward washington we have presented lees order for the attack on general mcclellan and here quote his order of march for the advance against general pope together with a note addressed to stuart commanding his cavalry for that officers guidance these orders indicate general lees * reach the left flank of the enemy prevent his retreat by destroying the bridges on the rappahannock and bring him to battle in the neighborhood of culpepper courthouse the plan failed in consequence of a delay of two days which took place in its * delay attributed at that time we know not with what justice to the unnecessarily deliberate movements of the corps commanded by general longstreet this delay enabled the enemy to gain information of the intended movement and when general lee advanced on the 20th of august instead of on the 18th as he had at first determined to do it was found that general pope had broken up his camps and was in rapid retreat lee followed and reached the rappahannock only to find that the federal army had passed that stream general pope who had promised to conduct none but offensive operations and never look to the rear had thus hastened to interpose the waters of the rappahannock between himself and his adversary and when general lee approached he found every crossing of the river heavily defended by the federal infantry and artillery in face of this large force occupying a commanding position on the heights general lee made no effort to cross he determined he says not to attempt the passage of the river at that point with the army but to seek a more favorable place to cross higher up the river and thus gain the enemys right this manoeuvre was intrusted to jackson whose corps formed the confederate left wing jackson advanced promptly to the warrenton springs ford which had been selected as the point of crossing drove away a force of the enemy posted at the place and immediately began to pass the river with his troops the movement was however interrupted by a severe rainstorm which swelled the waters of the rappahannock and rendered a further prosecution of it impracticable general lee was thus compelled to give up that plan and ordered jackson to withdraw the force which had crossed this was done and general lee was now called upon to adopt some other method of attack or to remain inactive in face of the enemy but to remain inactive was impossible the army must either advance or retire information which had just reached the confederate general rendered one of these two proceedings indispensable the information referred to had been obtained by general stuart the activity and energy of this officer especially in gaining intelligence now proved as they proved often afterward of the utmost importance to lee stuart had been directed by general lee to make an attack with a cavalry force on the orange and alexandria railroad in the enemys rear he had promptly carried out his orders by striking the federal communications at catletts station had destroyed there all that he found and torn up the railroad but better than all had captured a box containing official papers belonging to general pope these papers which stuart * day and night through storm and * convey to general lee presented the clearest evidence of the enemys movements and designs troops were hastening from every direction to renforce general pope the entire force on james river especially was to be brought rapidly north of the rappahannock and any delay in the operations of the confederates would thus expose them to attack from the federal forces concentrated from all quarters in their front it was thus necessary to act with decision and general lee resolved upon a movement apparently of the most reckless character this was to separate his army into two parts and while one remained confronting the enemy on the rappahannock send the other by a long circuit to fall on the federal rear near manassas this plan of action was opposed to the first rule of the military art that a general should never divide his force in the face of an enemy that lee ventured to do so on this occasion can only be explained on one hypothesis that he did not highly esteem the military ability of his opponent these flank attacks undoubtedly however possessed a great attraction for him as they did for jackson and in preferring such movement lee was probably actuated both by the character of the troops on both sides and by the nature of the country the men of both armies were comparatively raw levies highly susceptible to the influence of surprise and the appearance of an enemy on their flanks or in their rear was calculated to throw them into disorder the wooded character of the theatre of war generally rendered such movements practicable and all that was requisite was a certain amount of daring in the commander who was called upon to decide upon them this daring lee repeatedly exhibited and the uniform success of the movements indicates his sound generalship to command the force which was now to go on the perilous errand of striking general popes rear general lee selected jackson who had exhibited such promptness and decision in the campaigns of the valley of virginia rapidity of movement was necessary above all things and if any one could be relied upon for that it was the now famous stonewall jackson to him the operation was accordingly intrusted and his corps was at once put in motion crossing the rappahannock at an almost forgotten ford high up and out of view of the federal right jackson pushed forward day and night toward manassas reached thoroughfare gap in the bull run mountain west of that place passed through and completely destroyed the great mass of supplies in the federal depot at manassas the whole movement had been made with such rapidity and general stuart commanding the cavalry had so thoroughly guarded the flank of the advancing column from observation that manassas was a mass of smoking ruins almost before general pope was aware of the real danger intelligence soon reached him however of the magnitude of the blow aimed by lee and hastily breaking up his camps on the rappahannock he hurried to attack the force assailing his communications the first part of general lees plan had thus fully succeeded general pope who had occupied every ford of the rappahannock so as to render the passage difficult if not impossible had disappeared suddenly to go and attack the enemy in his rear general lee promptly moved in his turn with the great corps under longstreet and pushed toward manassas over nearly the same road followed by jackson the contest of generalship had now fully begun and the brain of general lee was matched against the brain of general pope it is no part of the design of the writer of this volume to exalt unduly the reputation of lee and detract from the credit due his adversaries justice has been sought to be done to general mcclellan the same measure of justice will be dealt out to his successors on the federal side nor is it calculated to elevate the fame of lee to show that his opponents were incapable and inefficient of general pope however it must be said that he suffered himself to be outgeneralled in every particular and the pithy comment of general lee that he did not appear to be aware of his situation sums up the whole subject it is beyond our purpose to enter upon any thing resembling a detailed narrative of the confused and complicated movements of the various corps of the army under general pope these have been the subject of the severest criticism by his own followers we shall simply notice the naked events jackson reached manassas on the night of august 26th took it and on the next day destroyed the great depot general pope was hastening to protect it but was delayed by ewell at bristoe and a force sent up from washington under the brave general taylor was driven off with loss then having achieved his aim jackson fell back toward sudley if the reader will look at the map he will now understand the exact condition of affairs jackson had burned the federal depot of supplies and retired before the great force hastening to rescue them he had with him about twenty thousand men and general popes force was probably triple that number thus the point was to hold general pope at armslength until the arrival of lee and to accomplish this great end jackson fell back beyond groveton there he formed line of battle and waited it is obvious that under these circumstances the true policy of general pope was to obstruct thoroughfare gap the only road by which lee could approach promptly and then crush jackson on the night of the 27th general mcdowell was accordingly sent thither with forty thousand men but general pope ordered him on the next morning to manassas where he hoped to bag the whole crowd he * is to say the force under jackson this was the fatal mistake made by general pope thoroughfare gap was comparatively undefended while general pope was marching to attack jackson who had disappeared it was the next thing to a certainty that general lee would attack him all parties were thus moving to and fro but the confederates enjoyed the very great advantage over general pope of knowing precisely how affairs stood and of having determined upon their own plan of operations jackson with his back to the mountain was waiting for lee lee was approaching rapidly to unite the two * of his army general pope meanwhile was marching and * apparently ignorant of the whereabouts of jackson general lee in personal command of longstreets corps reached the western end of thoroughfare gap about sunset on the 28th and the sound of artillery from the direction of groveton indicated that jackson and general pope had come in collision jackson had himself brought on this engagement by attacking the flank of one of general popes various columns as it marched across his front over the warrenton road and this was the origin of the sound wafted to general lees ears as he came in sight of thoroughfare it was certainly calculated to excite his nerves if they were capable of being excited jackson was evidently engaged and the disproportion between his forces and those of general pope rendered such an engagement extremely critical lee accordingly pressed forward reached the gap and the advance force suddenly halted the gap was defended the federal force posted here at the eastern opening of the gap was small and wholly inadequate for the purpose but this was as yet unknown to general lee his anxiety under these circumstances must have been great jackson might be crushed before his arrival he rode up to the summit of the commanding hill which rises just west of the gap and dismounting directed his fieldglass toward the shaggy defile in front the writer of these pages chanced to be near the confederate commander at this moment and was vividly impressed by the air of unmoved calmness which marked his countenance and demeanor nothing in the expression of his face and no hurried movement indicated excitement or anxiety here as on many other occasions lee impressed the writer as an individual gifted with the most surprising faculty of remaining cool and unaffected in the midst of circumstances calculated to arouse the most phlegmatic after reconnoitring for some moments without moving he closed his glass slowly as though he were buried in reflection and * at his leisure and walking back slowly to his horse mounted and rode down the hill the attack was not delayed and flanking columns were sent to cross north of the gap and assail the enemys rear but the assault in front was successful the small force of the enemy at the eastern opening of the gap retired and by nine oclock at night general longstreets corps was passing through all the next morning august 29th longstreets troops were coming into position on the right of jackson under the personal supervision of lee by noon the line of battle was formed lees army was once more united general pope had not been able to crush less than onehalf that army for twentyfour hours nearly in his clutches and it did not seem probable that he would meet with greater success now that the whole was concentrated and held in the firm hand of lee lees order of battle for the coming action was peculiar it resembled an open v with the opening toward the * corps forming the left wing and extending from near sudley to a point in rear of the small village of groveton longstreets corps forming the right wing and reaching from jacksons right to and beyond the warrenton road which runs to * the field of battle was nearly identical with that of july 21 1861 the only difference was that the confederates occupied the ground formerly held by the federal troops and that the latter attacked as johnston and beauregard had attacked from the direction of manassas and the * around the wellknown henry house the southern order of battle seems to have contemplated a movement on one or both of general popes flanks while he attacked in front an assault on either wing would expose him to danger from the other and it will be seen that the fate of the battle was decided by this judicious arrangement of the confederate commander the action began a little after noon when the federal right consisting of the troops of generals banks sigel and others advanced and made a vigorous attack on jacksons left under ap hill an obstinate conflict ensued the opposing lines fighting almost bayonet to bayonet delivering their volleys into each other at the distance of ten paces at the first charge an interval between two of hills brigades was penetrated by the enemy and that wing of jacksons corps was in great danger of being driven back this disaster was however prevented by the prompt stand made by two or three regiments the enemy was checked and a prompt * drove the federal assaulting columns back into the woods the attempt to break jacksons line at this point was not however abandoned the federal troops returned again and again to the encounter and general hill reported six separate and distinct assaults made upon him they were all repulsed in which important assistance was rendered by general early that brave officer attacked with vigor and aided by the fire of the confederate artillery from the elevated ground in jacksons rear drove the enemy before him with such slaughter that one of their regiments is said to have carried back but three men this assault of the enemy had been of so determined a character that general lee in order to relieve his left had directed hood and evans near his centre to advance and attack the left of the assaulting column hood was about to do so when he found a heavy force advancing to charge his own line a warm engagement followed which resulted in the repulse of the enemy and hood followed them a considerable distance inflicting heavy loss it was now nearly nine oclock at night and the darkness rendered further operations impossible the troops which had driven the enemy were recalled from their advanced position the southern line was reformed on the same ground occupied at the commencement of the action and general lee prepared for the more decisive struggle of the next day morning came august 30th but all the forenoon passed without a resumption of the battle each of the adversaries seemed to await some movement on the part of the other and the federal commander made heavy feints against both the confederate right and left with the view of discovering some weak point or of inducing lee to lay himself open to attack these movements had however no effect lee remained obstinately in his strong position rightly estimating the advantage it gave him and no doubt taking into consideration the want of supplies general pope must labor under a deficiency which rendered a prompt assault on his part indispensable the armies thus remained in face of each other without serious efforts upon either side until nearly or quite the hour of three in the afternoon general pope then resumed the assault on lees left under jackson with his best troops the charge was furious and a bloody struggle ensued but jackson succeeded in repulsing the force it fell back in disorder but was succeeded by a second and a third line which rushed forward at the doublequick in a desperate attempt to break the southern line these new attacks were met with greater obstinacy than at first and just as the opponents had closed in a heavy fire was directed against the federal column by colonel * lee commanding the artillery at lees centre this fire which was of the most rapid and destructive character struck the enemy in front and flank at once and seemed to sweep back the charging brigades as they came the fire of the cannon was then redoubled and jacksons line advanced with cheers before this charge the federal line broke and jackson pressed forward allowing them no respite general lee then threw forward longstreet who knowing what was expected of him was already moving the enemy were pressed thus in front and on their flank as lee had no doubt intended in forming his peculiar line the corps of jackson and longstreet closed in like two iron arms the federal forces were driven from position to position the glare of their cannon more and more distant indicated that they had abandoned further contest and at ten at night the darkness put an end to the battle and pursuit general pope was retreating with his defeated forces toward washington on the next day lee dispatched jackson to turn centreville and cut off the retreat of general pope the result was a severe engagement near * which was put an end to by a violent storm general pope now renforced by the commands of generals sumner and franklin had been enabled to hold his ground until night when on the next day september 2d the confederates advanced to fairfax courthouse it was found that the entire federal army was in rapid retreat upon washington such had been the fate of general pope the defeat of general pope opened the way for movements not contemplated probably by general lee when he marched from richmond to check the advance in culpepper his object at that time was doubtless simply to arrest the forward movement of the new force threatening gordonsville now however the position of the pieces on the great * of war had suddenly changed and it was obviously lees policy to extract all the advantage possible from the new condition of things he accordingly determined to advance into * fortifications in front of washington and the interposition of the potomac a broad stream easily defended rendering a movement in that direction * on the 3d of september therefore and without waiting to rest his army which was greatly fatigued with the nearly continuous marching and fighting since it had left the rapidan general lee moved toward leesburg crossed his forces near that place and to the music of the bands playing the popular air maryland my maryland advanced to frederick city which he occupied on the 7th of september lees object in invading maryland has been the subject of much discussion one party holding the view that his sole aim was to surround and capture a force of nine or ten thousand federal troops stationed at harpers ferry and another party maintaining that he proposed an invasion of pennsylvania as far as the susquehanna intending to fight a decisive battle there and advance thereafter upon philadelphia baltimore or washington the course pursued by an army commander is largely shaped by the progress of events it can only be said that general lee doubtless left the future to decide his ultimate movements meanwhile he had a distinct and * aim which he states in plain words his object was to draw the federal forces out of virginia first the movement culminating in the victory over the enemy at manassas had produced the effect of * them in every quarter on the coast of north carolina in western virginia and in the shenandoah valley had been heard the echo of the great events in middle and northern virginia general burnsides force had been brought up from the south leaving affairs at a * in that direction and contemporaneously with the retreat of general pope the federal forces at washington and beyond had fallen back to the potomac this left the way open and lees farther advance it was obvious would now completely clear virginia of her invaders the situation of affairs and the expected results are clearly stated by general lee the war was thus transferred he says from the interior to the frontier and the supplies of rich and productive districts made accessible to our army to prolong a state of affairs in every way desirable and not to permit the season for active operations to pass without endeavoring to inflict other injury upon the enemy the best course appeared to be the transfer of the army into maryland the state of things in maryland was another important consideration that great commonwealth was known to be * divided in its sentiment toward the federal government the eastern portion adhering generally to the side of the south and the western portion generally to the federal side but even as high up as frederick it was hoped that the southern cause would find adherents and volunteers to march under the confederate banner if this portion of the population had only the opportunity to choose their part * by federal bayonets it was supposed they would decide for the south in any event the movement would be important the condition of affairs in maryland general lee says encouraged the belief that the presence of our army however inferior to that of the enemy would induce the washington government to retain all its available force to provide for contingencies which its course toward the people of that state gave it reason to apprehend and to cross the potomac might afford us an opportunity to aid the citizens of maryland in any efforts they might be disposed to make to recover their liberty it may be said in summing up on this point that lee expected volunteers to * themselves under his standard tempted to do so by the hope of throwing off the yoke of the federal government and the army certainly shared this expectation the identity of sentiment generally between the people of the states of maryland and virginia and their strong social ties in the past rendered this anticipation reasonable and the feeling of the country at the result afterward was extremely bitter such were the first designs of lee his ultimate aim seems as clear by advancing into maryland and threatening baltimore and washington he knew that he would force the enemy to withdraw all their troops from the south bank of the potomac where they menaced the confederate communications with richmond when this was accomplished as it clearly would be his design was to cross the maryland extension of the blue ridge called there the south mountain advance by way of hagerstown into the cumberland valley and by thus forcing the enemy to follow him draw them to a distance from their base of supplies while his own communications would remain open by way of the shenandoah valley this was essentially the same plan pursued in the campaign of 1863 which terminated in the battle of gettysburg general lees movements now indicated similar intentions he doubtless wished in the first place to compel the enemy to pursue himthen to lead them as far as was * then if circumstances were favorable bring them to decisive battle success in which promised to open for him the gates of washington or baltimore and end the war it will now be seen how the delay caused by the movement of jackson against harpers ferry and the discovery by general mcclellan of the entire arrangement devised by lee for that purpose caused the failure of this whole ulterior design the southern army was concentrated in the neighborhood of frederick city by the 7th of september and on the next day general lee issued an address to the people of maryland we have not burdened the present narrative with lees army orders and other official papers but the great force and dignity of this address render it desirable to present it in full this address full of grave dignity and highly characteristic of the confederate commander was in vivid contrast with the harsh orders of general pope in culpepper the accents of friendship and persuasion were substituted for the rod of iron there would be no coercive measures no arrests with the alternative presented of an oath to support the south or instant banishment no * would be permitted in the lines of the southern army at least marylanders should enjoy freedom of thought and speech and every man should decide his destiny freely and without constraint this address couched in terms of such dignity had little effect upon the people either their sentiment in favor of the union was too strong or they found nothing in the condition of affairs to encourage their southern feelings a large federal force was known to be advancing lees army in tatters and almost without supplies presented a very uninviting appearance to recruits and few joined his standard the population in general remaining hostile or neutral the condition of the army was indeed forlorn it was worn down by marching and fighting the men had scarcely shoes upon their feet and above the tattered figures flaunting their rags in the sunshine were seen gaunt and begrimed faces in which could be read little of the romance of war the army was in no condition to undertake an invasion lacking much of the material of war feeble in transportation poorly provided with clothing and thousands of them destitute of shoes is lees description of his troops such was the condition of the better portion of the force on the opposite side of the potomac scattered along the hills could be seen a weary ragged hungry and confused multitude who had dragged along in rear of the rest unable to keep up and whose miserable appearance said little for the prospects of the army to which they belonged from these and other causes resulted the general apathy of the marylanders and lee soon discovered that he must look solely to his own men for success in his future movements he faced that conviction courageously and without uttering a word of comment or indulging in any species of crimination against the people of maryland resolutely commenced his movements looking to the capture of harpers ferry and the invasion of pennsylvania the promises of his address had been kept no one had been forced to follow the southern flag and now when the people turned their backs upon it closing the doors of the houses in the faces of the southern troops they remained unmolested lee had thus given a practical proof of the sincerity of his character he had promised nothing which he had not performed and in maryland as afterward in pennsylvania in 1863 he remained firm against the temptation to adopt the harsh course generally pursued by the commanders of invading armies he seems to have proceeded on the principle that good faith is as essential in public affairs as in private and to have resolved that in any event whether of victory or disaster his enemies should not have it in their power to say that he broke his plighted word or acted in a manner * a christian gentleman prompt action was now necessary the remnants of general popes army greatly scattered and disorganized by the severe battle of manassas had been rapidly reformed and brought into order again and to this force was added a large number of new troops hurried forward from the northern states to washington this new army was not to be commanded by general pope who had been weighed and found wanting in ability to contend with lee the force was intrusted to general mcclellan in spite of his * with the federal authorities and the urgent manner in which he had been called upon to take the head of affairs and protect the federal capital is the most eloquent of all commentaries upon the position which he held in the eyes of the country and the army it was felt indeed by all that the federal ship was rolling in the storm and an experienced pilot was necessary for her guidance general mcclellan was accordingly directed after general popes defeat to take command of every thing and see to the safety of washington and finding himself at length at the head of an army of about one hundred thousand men he proceeded after the manner of a good soldier to protect the federal capital by advancing into upper maryland in pursuit of lee general lee was already moving to the accomplishment of his designs the capture of harpers ferry and an advance into the cumberland valley his plan to attain the * object was simple and promised to be successful jackson was to march around by way of williamsport and martinsburg and thus approach from the south a force was meanwhile to seize upon and occupy the maryland heights a lofty spot of the mountain across the potomac north of the ferry in like manner another body of troops was to cross the potomac east of the blue ridge and occupy the loudon heights looking down upon harpers ferry from the east by this arrangement the retreat of the enemy would be completely cut off in every direction harpers ferry must be captured and having effected that result the whole confederate force detached for the purpose was to follow the main body of this army in the direction of hagerstown to take part in the proposed invasion of pennsylvania this excellent plan failed as will be seen from no fault of the great soldier who devised it but in consequence of unforeseen obstacles and especially of one of those singular incidents which occasionally reverse the * schemes and abruptly turn aside the currents of history jackson and the commanders coperating with him moved on september 10th general lee then with his main body crossed the south mountain taking the direction of hagerstown meanwhile general mcclellan had advanced cautiously and slowly withheld by incessant dispatches from washington warning him not to move in such a manner as to expose that city to danger such danger existed only in the imaginations of the authorities as the army in advancing extended its front from the potomac to the baltimore and ohio railroad general mcclellan nevertheless moved with very great precaution feeling his way step by step like a man in the dark when on reaching frederick city which the confederates had just evacuated good fortune suddenly came to his assistance this good fortune was the discovery of a copy of general lees orders of march for the army in which his whole plan was revealed general mcclellan had therein the unmistakable evidence of his opponents intentions and from that moment his advance was as rapid as before it had been deliberate the result of this fortunate discovery was speedily seen general lee while moving steadily toward hagerstown was suddenly compelled to turn his attention to the * in his rear it had not been the intention of lee to oppose the passage of the enemy through the south mountain as he desired to draw general mcclellan as far as possible from his base but the delay in the fall of harpers ferry now made this necessary it was essential to defend the * in order to insure the safety of the confederate troops at harpers ferry and lee accordingly directed general dh hill to oppose the passage of the enemy at boonsboro gap and longstreet was sent from hagerstown to support him an obstinate struggle now ensued for the possession of the main south mountain gap near boonsboro and the roar of jacksons artillery from harpers ferry must have prompted the assailants to determined efforts to force the passage the battle continued until night september 14th and resulted in heavy loss on both sides the brave general reno of the united states army among others losing his life darkness put an end to the action the federal forces not having succeeded in passing the gap but learning that a column of the enemy had crossed below and threatened him with an attack in flank general lee determined to retire in the direction of sharpsburg where jackson and the forces coperating with him could join the main body of the army this movement was effected without difficulty and lee notices the skill and efficiency of general fitz lee in covering the rear with his cavalry the federal army failed to press forward as rapidly as it is now obvious it should have done the head of the column did not appear west of the mountain until eight oclock in the morning september 15th and nearly at the same moment the attack began at dawn in about two hours the garrison surrendered says general lee harpers ferry yielded to jackson * couriers brought the welcome intelligence of jacksons success to general lee as the latter was approaching sharpsburg and official information speedily came that the result had been the capture of more than eleven thousand men thirteen thousand smallarms and seventythree cannon it was probably this large number of men and amount of military stores falling into the hands of the confederates which afterward induced the opinion that lees sole design in invading maryland had been the reduction of harpers ferry general mcclellan had thus failed in spite of every effort which he had made to relieve harpers ferry and no other course remained now but to follow lee and bring him to battle the federal army accordingly moved on the track of its adversary and on the afternoon of the same day september 15th found itself in sight of lees forces drawn up on the western side of antietam creek near the village of sharpsburg at last the great opponents were in face of each other and a battle it was obvious could not long be delayed general lee had once more sustained a serious check from the skill and soldiership of the officer who had conducted the successful retreat of the federal army from the chickahominy to james river the defeat and dispersion of the army of general pope on the last day of august seemed to have opened pennsylvania to the confederates on the 15th of september a fortnight afterward general mcclellan at the head of a new army raised in large measure by the magic of his name had pursued the victorious confederate checked his further advance and forcing him to abandon his designs of invasion brought him to bay a hundred miles from the capital this was generalship it would seem in the true acceptation of the term and mcclellan harassed and hampered by the authorities who looked but coldly upon him could say with coriolanus alone i did it lee was thus compelled to give up his movement in the direction of pennsylvania and concentrate his army to receive the assault of general mcclellan jackson marching with his customary promptness joined him with a portion of the detached force on the next day september 16th and almost immediately those thunders which prelude the great struggles of history began general lee had drawn up his army on the high ground west of the antietam a narrow and winding stream which flows through fields dotted with homesteads and * of fruit and forest trees to the potomac longstreets corps was posted on the right of the road from sharpsburg to boonsboro his right flank guarded by the waters of the stream which here bends westward on the left of the boonsboro road dh hills command was stationed two brigades under general hood were drawn up on hills left and when jackson arrived lee directed him to post his command on the left of hood his right resting on the hagerstown road and his left extending backward * toward the potomac here making a large bend where stuart with his cavalry and horseartillery occupied the ground to the rivers bank this arrangement of his troops was extremely judicious as the sequel proved it was probable that general mcclellan would direct his main attack against the confederate left with the view of turning that flank and hemming in the southern army or driving it into the river by retiring jacksons left lee provided for this contingency and it will be seen that the design attributed by him to his adversary was that determined upon general mcclellan occupied the ground on the eastern bank of the antietam he had evidently massed his forces opposite the confederate left but a heavy order of battle stood opposite the centre and right of lee where bridges crossed the stream the respective numbers of the adversaries can be stated with accuracy our forces at the battle of antietam said general mcclellan when before the committee of investigation afterward were total in action eightyseven thousand one hundred and * general lee says in his report this great battle was fought by less than forty thousand men on our side colonel walter h taylor a gentleman of the highest character and formerly adjutantgeneral of the army makes the confederate numbers somewhat less in a memorandum before the writer he says our strength at sharpsburg i think this is correct jackson including ap hill 10000 longstreet 12000 dh hill and walker 7000 effective infantry # cavalry and artillery # total of all arms # this disproportion was very great amounting as it did to more than two for one but this was unavoidable the southern army had been worn out by their long marching and fighting portions of the command were scattered all over the roads of northern virginia wearily dragging their * limbs and shoeless feet toward winchester whither they were directed to repair this was the explanation of the fact that in spite of the ardent desire of the whole army to participate in the great movement northward lee had in line of battle at sharpsburg less than forty thousand men general mcclellan made a demonstration against his adversary on the evening of the 16th before the day of the main struggle he threw his right commanded by general hooker across the antietam at a point out of range of fire from the confederates and made a vigorous attack on jacksons two divisions lying near the hagerstown road running northward and thus parallel with lees line of battle a brief engagement took place in the vicinity of the dunker church in a fringe of woods west of the road but it was too late to effect any thing of importance night fell and the engagement ceased general hooker retaining his position on the west side of the stream the opposing lines then remained at rest waiting for the morning which all now saw would witness the commencement of the more serious conflict the battle of sharpsburg or antietam for it is known by both names began at early dawn on the 17th of september general mcclellan had obviously determined to direct his main assault against the confederate left a movement which general lee had foreseen and provided for and at dawn commenced a rapid fire of artillery upon that portion of the confederate line under cover of this fire general hooker then advanced his infantry and made a headlong assault upon jacksons line with the obvious view of crushing that wing of lees army or driving it back on sharpsburg and the river the federal force making this attack or advancing promptly to support it consisted of the corps of generals hooker mansfield and sumner and numbered according to general sumner forty thousand men of whom eighteen thousand belonged to general hookers corps jacksons whole force was four thousand men of the truth of this statement of the respective forces proof is here given i have always believed said general sumner afterward before the war committee that instead of sending these troops into that action in * had general mcclellan authorized me to march there forty thousand men on the left flank of the enemy etc hooker formed his corps of eighteen thousand men etc says mr swinton the able and candid northern historian of the war jacksons force is shown by the confederate official reports his corps consisted of ewells division and jacksons old division general jones commanding the latter reported the division at the beginning of the fight numbered not over one thousand six hundred men early commanding ewells division reported the three brigades to number lawtons # hayess # walkers # # old division as above # jacksons corps 4000 this was the entire force carried by general jackson into the fight and these four thousand men as the reader will perceive bore the brunt of the first great assault of general mcclellan just as the light broadened in the east above the crest of mountains rising in rear of the federal lines general hooker made his assault his aim was plainly to drive the force in his front across the hagerstown road and back on the potomac and in this he seemed about to succeed jackson had placed in front ewells division of twentyfour hundred men this force received general hookers charge and a furious struggle followed in which the division was nearly destroyed a glance at the casualties will show this they were remarkable general lawton division commander was wounded and carried from the field colonel douglas brigade commander was killed colonel walker also commanding brigade was disabled lawtons brigade lost five hundred and fiftyfour killed and wounded out of eleven hundred and fifty and five out of six regimental commanders hayess brigade lost three hundred and twentythree out of five hundred and fifty and all the regimental commanders walkers brigade lost two hundred and twentyeight out of less than seven hundred and three out of four regimental commanders and of the staffofficers of the division scarcely one remained in an hour after dawn this heavy slaughter had been effected in ewells division and the detailed statement which we have given will best show the stubborn resistance offered by the southern troops still they were unable to hold their ground and fell back at last in disorder before general hooker who pressed forward to seize the hagerstown road and crush the whole confederate left he was met however by jacksons old division of sixteen hundred men who had been held in reserve and general lee hastened to the point threatened hoods two small brigades one of which general hood states numbered but eight hundred and * men with this force jackson now met the advancing column of general hooker delivering a heavy fire from the woods upon the federal forces in face of this fire they hesitated and hood made a vigorous charge general stuart opening at the same time a crossfire on the enemy with his horseartillery the combined fire increased their disorganization and it now turned into disorder jackson seized the moment as always throwing forward his whole line and the enemy were first checked and then driven back in confusion the confederates pursuing and cheering the first struggle had thus resulted in favor of the * about six thousand they had repulsed eighteen * it was obvious to general mcclellan that without reinforcements his right could not hold its ground he accordingly just at sunrise sent general mansfields corps to the aid of general hooker and at nine oclock general sumners corps was added making in all forty thousand men the appearance of affairs at this moment was discouraging to the federal commander his heavy assaulting column had been forced back with great slaughter general hooker had been wounded and borne from the field general mansfield while forming his line had been mortally wounded and now at nine oclock when the corps of general sumner arrived the prospect was depressing of the condition of the federal forces general sumners own statement conveys a very distinct conception on going upon the field said general sumner before the war committee i found that general hookers corps had been dispersed and routed i passed him some distance in the rear where he had been carried wounded but i saw nothing of his corps at all as i was advancing with my command on the field i sent one of my staffofficers to find where they were and general ricketts the only officer we could find stated that he could not raise three hundred men of the corps general mansfields corps also had been checked and now began to waver and break such had been the result of the great federal assault and it was highly creditable to the confederate arms with a comparatively insignificant force jackson had received the attack of the entire federal right wing and had not only repulsed but nearly broken to pieces the large force in his front the arrival of general sumner however completely changed the face of affairs and as his fresh troops advanced those which had been so roughly handled by jackson had an opportunity to reform this was rapidly effected and having marshalled his troops general sumner an officer of great dash and courage made a vigorous charge from this moment the battle began to rage with new fury general lee had sent to the left the brigades of colquitt ripley and mcrae and with these the troops of hood and his own shattered division jackson presented a stubborn front but his loss was heavy general starke of the old division was killed the brigade regimental and company officers fell almost without an exception and the brigades dwindled to mere * under the great pressure jackson was at length forced back one of general sumners divisions drove the right of the confederates beyond the hagerstown road and at this moment the long struggle seemed ended the great wrestle in which the adversaries had so long staggered to and fro advancing and retreating in turn seemed at last virtually decided in favor of the federal arms this was undoubtedly the turningpoint of the battle of sharpsburg and general lee had witnessed the conflict upon his left with great anxiety it was impossible however to send thither more troops than he had already sent as will be seen in a moment both his centre and right were extremely weak ap hill and general mclaws had not arrived from harpers ferry thus the left had been renforced to the full extent of lees ability and now that portion of his line seemed about to be crushed fortunately however general mclaws who had been delayed longer than was expected by general lee at last arrived and was hurried to the left it was ten oclock and in that one hour the fighting of an entire day seemed to have been concentrated jackson was holding his ground with difficulty when the divisions of mclaws and walker were sent to him as soon as they reached the field they were thrown into action and general lee had the satisfaction of witnessing a new order of things the * might rather be called the onward * the federal line was checked jacksons weary men took fresh heart that great commander promptly assumed the offensive and advancing his whole line drove the enemy before him until he reoccupied the ground from which general sumner had forced him to retire from the ground thus occupied the federal forces were unable to dislodge him and the great struggle of the left at sharpsburg was over it had begun at dawn and was decided by ten or eleven oclock and the troops on both sides had fought as resolutely as in any other action of the war the event had been decided by the pertinacity of the southern troops and by the prompt movement of renforcements by general lee from his right and centre posted near his centre he had surveyed at one glance the whole field of action the design of general mcclellan to direct his main assault upon the confederate left was promptly penetrated and the rapid concentration of the southern forces in that quarter had by defeating this movement decided the result of the battle attacks on the confederate centre and right followed that upon the left in the centre a great disaster was at one time imminent owing to a mistake of orders the brave general rhodes had drawn back his brigade posted * was seen by the * a sudden rush was made by them with the view of piercing lees centre the promptness and courage of a few officers and a small body of troops defeated this attempt general dh hill rallied a few hundred men and opened fire with a single gun and colonel cooke faced the enemy with his regiment standing boldly in line says general lee without a cartridge the stand made by this small force saved the army from serious disaster the federal line retired but a last assault was soon begun this time against the confederate right it continued in a somewhat desultory manner until four in the evening when having massed a heavy column under general burnside opposite the bridge in front of lees right wing general mcclellan forced the bridge and carried the crest beyond the moment was critical as the confederate force at this point was less than three thousand men but fortunately renforcements arrived consisting of ap hills forces from harpers ferry these attacked the enemy drove him from the hill across the antietam again and so threatening did the situation at that moment appear to general mcclellan that he is said to have sent general burnside the message hold your ground if you cannot then the bridge to the last man always the bridge if the bridge is lost all is lost the urgency of this order sufficiently indicates that the federal commander was not without solicitude for the safety of his own left wing ignorant doubtless of the extremely small force which had thus repulsed general burnside in all four thousand five hundred men he feared that general lee would cross the bridge assail his left and that the hardfought day might end in disaster to his own army that general lee contemplated this movement in spite of the disproportion of numbers is intimated in his official report it was nearly dark he says and the federal artillery was massed to defend the bridge with general porters corps consisting of fresh troops behind it under these circumstances he adds it was deemed injudicious to push our advantage further in the face of fresh troops of the enemy much exceeding our own the idea of an advance against the federal left was accordingly abandoned and a movement of jacksons command which lee directed with the view of turning the federal right was discontinued from the same considerations night had come both sides were worn out neither of the two great adversaries cared to risk another struggle and the * battle of sharpsburg was over the two armies remained facing each other throughout the following day during the night of this day lee crossed with his army back into virginia he states his reasons for this as we could not look for a material increase of strength he says and the enemys force could be largely and rapidly augmented it was not thought prudent to wait until he should be ready again to offer battle general mcclellan does not seem to have been able to renew the struggle at that time the next morning he says referring to the day succeeding the battle i found that our loss had been so great and there was so much disorganization in some of the commands that i did not consider it proper to renew the attack that day this decision of general mcclellans subjected him subsequently to very harsh criticism from the federal authorities the theory having obtained at washington that he had had it in his power by renewing the battle to cut lee to pieces of the probability of such a result the reader will form his own judgment the ground for such a conclusion seems slight the loss and disorganization were it would seem even greater on the federal than on the confederate side and lee would have probably been better able to sustain an attack than general mcclellan to make it it will be seen that general meade afterward under circumstances more favorable still declined to attack lee at williamsport if one of the two commanders be greatly censured the other must be also and the world will be always apt to conclude that they knew what could be effected better than the civilians but general mcclellan did make an attempt to crush lee such as the authorities at washington desired and its result may possibly throw light on the point in discussion on the night of the 19th lee having crossed the potomac on the night of the 18th general mcclellan sent a considerable force across the river near shepherdstown which drove off the confederate artillery there and at daylight formed line of battle on the south bank protected by their cannon north of the river of the brief but bloody engagement which * incident of the war little dwelt upon in the * ap hill who was sent by lee to repulse the enemy gives an animated account the federal artillery to the number of seventy pieces he says lined the opposite heights and their infantry was strongly posted on the crest of the virginia hills when he advanced with his division he was met by the most tremendous fire of artillery he ever saw but the men continued to move on without wavering and the attack resulted in the complete rout of the enemy who were driven pellmell into the river the current of which was blue with floating bodies general hill chronicles this incident in terms of unwonted eloquence and declares that by the account of the enemy themselves they lost three thousand men killed and drowned from one brigade which appears to be an exaggeration his own loss was in killed and wounded two hundred and * this repulse was decisive and general mcclellan made no further attempt to pursue the adversary who standing at bay on the soil of virginia was still more formidable than he had been on the soil of maryland as we have intimated on a preceding page the result of this attempt to pursue would seem to relieve general mcclellan from the criticism of the washington authorities if he was repulsed with heavy slaughter in his attempt to strike at lee on the morning of september 20th it is not probable that an assault on his adversary on september 18th would have had different results no further crossing at that time was undertaken by the federal commander his army was moved toward harpers ferry an important base for further operations and lees army went into camp along the banks of the opequan general lee and his adversary had displayed conspicuous merit in the campaign thus terminated and we shall pause for a moment to glance back upon this great passage at arms to give precedence to general mcclellan he had assembled an army after the defeat at manassas with a promptness for which only his own great personal popularity can adequately account had advanced to check lee and had fully succeeded in doing so and had thus not only protected the fertile territory of pennsylvania from invasion but had struck a deathblow for the time to any designs general lee might have had to advance on the federal capital if the situation of affairs at that moment be attentively considered the extreme importance of these results will not fail to appear it may perhaps be said with justice that general mcclellan had saved the federal cause from decisive defeat there was no army to protect washington but the body of troops under his command these were largely raw levies which defeat would have broken to pieces and thus the way would have been open for lees march upon washington or toward * movement whose probable result would have been a treaty of peace and the independence of the southern confederacy all these hopes were reversed by mcclellans rapid march and prompt attack in the hours of a single autumn day on the banks of the antietam the triumphant advance of the confederates was checked and defeated and if the further fact be considered that the adversary thus checkmated was lee the military ability of general mcclellan must be conceded it is the fashion it would appear in some quarters to deny him this quality history will decide the merit of lee was equally conspicuous and his partial failure in the campaign was due to circumstances over which he had no control his plan as was always the case with him was * and every contingency had been provided for he was disappointed in his aim by three causes which he could not foresee one was the great diminution of his force owing to the rapidity of his march and the incessant fighting another the failure in obtaining recruits in maryland and a third the discovery by general mcclellan of the lost dispatch as it is called which revealed lees whole plan to his adversary in consequence of the finding of the order of march mcclellan advanced with such rapidity that the * of the southern army on the hills north of leesburg had no opportunity of joining the main body the gaps in the ranks of the army thus made were not filled up by maryland recruits lee fell back and his adversary followed no longer fearful of advancing too quickly jackson had no time after reducing harpers ferry to rejoin lee at hagerstown thus concentration of his troops and a battle somewhere near sharpsburg were rendered a necessity with general lee in this tissue of adverse events the discovery of the order of march by general mcclellan occupies a very prominent place this incident resembles what the french call a fatality who was to blame for the circumstance still remains a mystery but it may be said with entire certainty that the brave officer upon whom it was charged was entirely guiltless of all fault in the matter whatever may have been the secret history of the lost dispatch however it certainly fell into general mcclellans hands and largely directed the subsequent movements of the opposing armies from what is here written it will be seen that lee was not justly chargeable with the result of the maryland campaign he had provided for every thing as far as lay in his power had he not been disappointed in events to be fairly anticipated it seemed his force would have received large * his rear would have closed up and the advance into pennsylvania would have taken place instead of this he was forced to retire and fight a pitched battle at sharpsburg and this action certainly exhibited on lees part military ability of the highest order the force opposed to him had been at least double that of his own army and the federal troops had fought with a gallantry unsurpassed in any other engagement of the war that their assault on lee failed was due to the fighting qualities of his troops and his own generalship his army had been manoeuvred with a rapidity and precision which must have excited even the admiration of the distinguished soldier opposed to him he had promptly concentrated his forces opposite every threatened point in turn and if he had not been able to carry out the axiom of napoleon that a commander should always be superior to the enemy at the point of contact he had at least done all that was possible to effect that end and had so far succeeded as to have repulsed if not routed his adversary this is the main feature to be noticed in lees handling of his troops at sharpsburg an unwary or inactive commander would have there suffered decisive defeat for the confederate left wing numbered throughout the early part of the battle scarcely more than four thousand men while the column directed against it amounted first to eighteen thousand and in all to forty thousand men to meet the impact of this heavy mass not only desperate fighting but rapid and skilful manoeuvring was necessary the record we have presented will enable the reader to form his own opinion whether lee was equal to this emergency involving the fate of his army military critics examining this great battle with fair and candid eyes will not fail we think to discern the truth that the southern army of less than forty thousand men repulsed more than eighty thousand in the battle of sharpsburg was due to the hard fighting of the smaller force and the skill with which its commander manoeuvred it general lee and his army passed the brilliant days of autumn in the beautiful valley of the shenandoah this region is famous for its * and the beauty of its scenery the mountain winds are pure and * and the forests which in the season of autumn assume all the colors of the rainbow inspire the mind with the most agreeable sensations the region in fact is known as the garden of virginia and the benign influence of their surroundings was soon seen on the faces of the troops a northern writer who saw them at sharpsburg describes them as ragged hungry and in all ways miserable but their forlorn condition as to clothing and supplies of every description made no perceptible difference in their demeanor now in their camps along the banks of the picturesque little stream called the opequan which rising south of winchester * through beautiful fields and forests to empty into the potomac the troops laughed jested sang rude * and exhibited a joyous indifference to their privations and hardships which said much for their courage and endurance those who carefully considered the appearance and demeanor of the men at that time saw that much could be effected with such tough material and had another opportunity to witness under circumstances calculated to test it the careless indifference to the past as well as the future peculiar alike to soldiers and children these men who had passed through a campaign of hard marches and nearly incessant battles seemed to have forgotten all their troubles and sufferings the immense strain upon their energies had left them apparently as fresh and efficient as when the campaign begun there was no want of * rather an excessive elasticity and readiness to undertake new movements they had plainly acquired confidence in themselves rightly regarding the event of the battle of sharpsburg where they were so largely outnumbered as highly honorable to them and they had acquired still greater confidence in the officers who commanded them we shall hereafter speak more particularly of the sentiment of the troops toward general lee at this period of his connection with the army the great events of the war continually modified the relations between him and his men as they came to know him better and better he steadily rose in their admiration and regard at this * autumn of #* may be said that the troops had already begun to love their leader and had bestowed upon him as an army commander their implicit confidence without this confidence on the part of his men a general can effect little with it he may accomplish almost any thing the common soldier is a child and feels that the directing authority is above him that he should look upon that authority with respect and confidence is the first necessity of effecting military organization lee had already inspired the troops with this sentiment and it was mainly the secret of his often astounding successes afterward the men universally felt that their commander was equal to any and every emergency such a repute cannot be usurped troops measure their leaders with instinctive acumen and a very astonishing accuracy they form their opinions for themselves on the merits of the question and lee had already impressed the army with a profound admiration for his soldiership from this to the sentiment of personal affection the transition was easy and the kindness consideration and simplicity of the man made all love him throughout the campaign lee had not been heard to utter one harsh word a patient forbearance and kindness had been constantly exhibited in all his dealings with officers and men he was always in front indifferent plainly to personal danger and the men looked now with admiring eyes and a feeling of everincreasing affection on the erect soldierly figure in the plain uniform with scarce any indication of rank and the calm face with its expression of grave dignity and composure which remained unchanged equally on the march and in battle it may be said that when he assumed command of the army before richmond the troops had taken him on trust now they had come to love him and when he appeared the camps buzzed the men ran to the road called out to each other there goes mas robert or old uncle robert and cheers followed him as he rode by the country generally seemed to share the opinion of the army there was exhibited even at this early period of the war by the people at large a very great admiration and affection for general lee while in the shenandoah valley where jackson was beloved almost beyond expression lee had evidences of the position which he occupied in the eyes of the people which must have been extremely gratifying to him grayhaired men came to his camp and uttered prayers for his health and happiness as the great leader of the south aged ladies greeted him with faltering expressions full of deep feeling and pathetic earnestness and wherever he went young girls and children received him with their brightest smiles the august fame of the great soldier who has now passed away no doubt renders these memories of personal interviews with him dear to many even the most trifling incidents are cherished and kept fresh by repetition and the writer of these pages recalls at the moment one of these trifles which may possibly interest some readers there stood and still stands an ancient and hospitable homestead on the south bank of the opequan the hearts of whose inmates one and all were ardently with the south in her struggle soon after sharpsburg general lee one day visited the old * crowning the grassy hill and overshadowed by great oaks generals jackson longstreet and stuart accompanied him and the reception which he met with though we cannot describe it was such as would have satisfied the most exacting the children came to him and held out their small hands the ladies divided their attention between him and the beloved hero of the valley jackson and the lady of the manor could only express her sense of the great honor of receiving such company by declaring with a smile that the dinner resembled the famous breakfast at * in scotts old * general lee highly enjoyed this and seemed disposed to laugh when the curious fact was pointed out to him that he had seated himself at table in a chair with an * united states eagle * upon its back the result of this visit it appeared afterward was a sentiment of great regard and affection for the general personally by all at the old * old and young were charmed by his grave sweetness and mild courtesy and doubtless he inspired the same sentiment in other places his headquarters were at this time in a field some miles from winchester an englishman who visited him there described the general and his surroundings with accuracy and from the account printed in * magazine we quote the following sentences in visiting the headquarters of the confederate generals but particularly those of general lee any one accustomed to see european armies in the field cannot fail to be struck with the great absence of all the pomp and circumstance of war in and around their * lees headquarters consisted of about seven or eight * pitched with their backs to a stake fence upon a piece of ground so rocky that it was unpleasant to ride over it its only recommendation being a little stream of good water which flowed close by the generals tent in front of the tents were some three * wagons drawn up without any regularity and a number of horses roamed loose about the field the servants who were of course slaves and the mounted soldiers called couriers who always accompany each general of division in the field were * with tents and slept in or under the wagons wagons tents and some of the horses were marked us showing that part of that huge debt in the north has gone to furnishing even the confederate generals with camp equipments no guard or sentries were to be seen in the vicinity no crowd of * loitering about making themselves agreeable to visitors and endeavoring to save their generals from receiving those who had no particular business a large farmhouse stands close by which in any other army would have been the generals residence pro * but as no liberties are allowed to be taken with personal property in lees army he is particular in setting a good example himself his staff are crowded together two or three in a tent none are allowed to carry more baggage than a small box each and his own kit is but very little larger every one who approaches him does so with marked respect although there is none of that bowing and flourishing of forage caps which occurs in the presence of european generals and while all honor him and place implicit faith in his courage and ability those with whom he is most intimate feel for him the affection of sons to a father old general scott was correct in saying that when lee joined the southern cause it was worth as much as the accession of twenty thousand men to the rebels since then every injury that it was possible to inflict the northerners have heaped upon him notwithstanding all these personal losses however when speaking of the yankees he neither evinced any bitterness of feeling nor gave utterance to a single violent expression but alluded to many of his former friends and companions among them in the kindest terms he spoke as a man proud of the victories won by his country and confident of ultimate success under the blessing of the almighty whom he glorified for past successes and whose aid he invoked for all future operations the writer adds that the troops regarded him in the light of infallible love and had a fixed and * faith in all he * calm confidence of victory when serving under him the peculiarly interesting part of this foreign testimony however is that in which the writer speaks of general lees religious sentiment of his gratitude for past mercies and prayers for the assistance of the almighty in the hours of conflict still to come this point we shall return to endeavoring to give it that prominence which it deserves at present we shall leave the subject of general lee in his private and personal character and proceed to narrate the last campaign of the year 1862 from the central frontier of his headquarters near winchester the key of the lower valley general lee was able to watch at once the line of the potomac in his front beyond which lay general mcclellans army and the gaps of the blue ridge on his right through which it was possible for the enemy by a rapid movement to advance and attack his flank and rear if lee had at any time the design of recrossing into maryland he abandoned it general mcclellan attributed that design to him i have since been confirmed in the belief he wrote that if i had crossed the potomac below harpers ferry in the early part of october general lee would have recrossed into maryland of lees ability to thus * maryland there can be no doubt his army was rested * and in high spirits the stragglers had rejoined their commands and it is certain that the order for a new advance would have been hailed by the * troops with enthusiasm no such order was however issued and soon the approach of winter rendered the movement impossible more than a month thus passed the two armies remaining in face of each other no engagement of any importance occurred during this period of inactivity but once or twice the federal commander sent heavy reconnoitring forces across the potomac and stuart now mounting to the zenith of his reputation as a * repeated his famous ride around mcclellan on the chickahominy the object of general lee in directing this movement of the cavalry was the ordinary one on such occasions of obtaining information and inflicting injury upon the enemy stuart responded with ardor to the order he had conceived a warm affection for general lee mingled with a respect for his military genius nearly unbounded and at this time as always afterward received the orders of his commander for active operations with enthusiasm with about eighteen hundred troopers and four pieces of horseartillery stuart crossed the potomac above williamsport marched rapidly to chambersburg in pennsylvania where he destroyed the * and other buildings containing a large number of arms and military stores and continued his way thence toward frederick city with the bold design of completely passing around the federal army and recrossing the river east of the blue ridge in this he succeeded thanks to his skill and audacity in spite of every effort of the enemy to cut off and destroy him reaching whites ford on the potomac north of leesburg he disposed his horseartillery so as to cover this movement cut his way through the federal cavalry disputing his passage and recrossed into virginia with a large number of captured horses and without losing a man this expedition excited astonishment and a prominent officer of the federal army declared that he would not have believed that * could stand it as the distance passed over in about fortyeight hours during which considerable delay had occurred at chambersburg was nearly or quite one hundred miles general mcclellan complained that his orders had not been obeyed and said that after these orders he did not think it possible for stuart to recross and believed the destruction or capture of his entire force perfectly certain soon afterward the federal commander attempted reconnoissances in his turn a considerable force of infantry supported by artillery crossed the potomac and advanced to the vicinity of the little village of * but on the same evening fell back rapidly doubtless fearful that lee would interpose a force between them and the river and cut off their retreat this was followed by a movement of the federal cavalry which crossed at the same spot and advanced up the road leading toward martinsburg these were met and subsequently driven back by colonel whf lee son of the general a third and more important attempt to reconnoitre took place toward the end of october general mcclellan then crossed a considerable body of troops both at shepherdstown and harpers ferry the columns advanced to * and charlestown respectively and near the former village a brief engagement took place without results general mcclellan who had come in person as far as charlestown then returned with his troops across the potomac and further hostilities for the moment ceased these reconnoissances were the prelude however of an important movement which the federal authorities had been long urging general mcclellan to make although the battle of sharpsburg had been indecisive in one acceptation of the term in another it had been entirely decisive a drawn battle of the clearest sort it yet decided the future movements of the opposing armies general lee had invaded maryland with the design of advancing into * result of sharpsburg was that he fell back into virginia general mcclellan had marched from washington with no object but an * campaign to afford the capital protection he was now enabled to undertake anew the invasion of virginia to the success of such a movement the federal commander seems rightly to have considered a full and complete equipment of his troops absolutely essential he was directed at once after sharpsburg to advance upon lee he replied that it was impossible neither his men nor his horses had shoes or rations new orders * halleck appearing to regard the difficulties urged by general mcclellan as imaginary new protests followed and then new protests and new orders again until finally a peremptory dispatch came this dispatch was cross the potomac and give battle to the enemy or drive him south an order bearing the impress of the * good sense and rough directness of the federal president this order it was necessary in the end to obey and general mcclellan having decided in favor of a movement across the potomac east instead of west of the mountain proceeded in the last days of october to cross his army his plan was excellent and is here set forth in his own words the plan of campaign i adopted during this advance he says was to move the army well in hand parallel to the blue ridge taking warrenton as the point of direction for the main army seizing each pass on the blue ridge by detachments as we approached it and guarding them after we had passed as long as they would enable the enemy to trouble our communications with the potomac we depended upon harpers ferry and berlin for supplies until the manassas gap railway was reached when that occurred the passes in our rear were to be abandoned and the army massed ready for action or movement in any direction it was my intention if upon reaching ashbys or any other pass the enemy were in force between it and the potomac in the valley of the shenandoah to move into the valley and endeavor to gain their rear from this statement of general mcclellan it will be seen that his plan was judicious and displayed a thorough knowledge of the country in which he was about to operate the * of the region is peculiar the valley of the shenandoah in which lees army lay waiting is separated from * virginia through which general mcclellan was about to advance by the wooded ramparts of the blue ridge mountains passable only at certain points these gaps as they are called in virginia are the natural * to the valley and as long as general mcclellan held them as he proposed to do by strong detachments he would be able both to protect his own communications with the potomac and if he thought fit to do so enter the valley and assail the confederate rear that he ever seriously contemplated the latter design is however extremely doubtful it is not credible that he would have undertaken to cut off lees whole army and if he designed a movement of that description against any portion of the southern army which might be detached the opportunity was certainly presented to him by lee when jackson was left as will be seen at millwood no sooner had general mcclellan commenced crossing the potomac east of the mountain than general lee broke up his camp along the opequan and moved to check this new and formidable advance into the heart of virginia it was not known however whether the whole of the federal forces had crossed east of the blue ridge and to guard against a possible movement on his rear from the direction of harpers ferry as well as on his flank through the gaps of the mountain lee sent jacksons corps to take position on the road from charlestown to berryville where he could oppose an advance of the enemy from either direction the rest of the army then moved * but rapidly across the mountain into culpepper under these circumstances general mcclellan had an excellent opportunity to strike a heavy blow at jackson who seemed to invite that movement by crossing soon afterward in accordance with directions from lee one of his divisions to the east side of the mountain on the federal rear that general mcclellan did not strike is not creditable to him as a commander the confederate army was certainly divided in a very tempting manner longstreet was in culpepper on the 3d of november the day after general mcclellans rearguard had passed the potomac and nothing would seem to have been easier than to cut the confederate forces by interposing between them by seizing the blue ridge gaps and thus shutting up all the avenues of exit from the valley general mcclellan would have had it in his power it would seem to crush jackson or if that wily commander escaped longstreet in culpepper was exposed to attack general mcclellan did not embrace this opportunity of a decisive blow and lee seems to have calculated upon the caution of his adversary jacksons presence in the valley only embarrassed mcclellan as lee no doubt intended it should no attempt was made to strike at him on the contrary the federal army continued steadily to concentrate upon warrenton where on the 7th of november general mcclellan was abruptly relieved of the command he was in his tent at * at the moment when the dispatch was handed to * by an officer from washington through a heavy snowstorm then falling general * e burnside was in the tent mcclellan read the dispatch calmly and handing it indifferently to his visitor said well burnside you are to command the army such was the abrupt termination of the military career of a commander who fills a large space in the history of the war in virginia the design of this volume is not such as to justify an extended notice of him or a detailed examination of his abilities as a soldier that he possessed military endowments of a very high order is conceded by most persons but his critics add that he was dangerously prone to caution and inactivity such was the criticism of his enemies at washington and throughout the north and his pronounced political opinions had gained him a large number it may however be permitted one who can have no reason to unduly commend him to say that the retreat to james river and the arrest of lee in his march of invasion toward pennsylvania seem to indicate the possession of something more than inactivity and of that species of caution which * success it will probably however be claimed by few even among the personal friends of this general that he was a soldier of the first * competent to oppose lee as to the personal qualities of general mcclellan there seems to be no difference of opinion he was a gentleman of high breeding and detested all oppression of the weak and noncombatants somewhat prone to hauteur in presence of the * of the executive and other civilians unskilled in military affairs he was patient mild and cordial with his men these qualities with others which he possessed seem to have rendered him peculiarly acceptable to the private soldier and it is certain that he was beyond comparison the most popular of all the generals who one after another commanded the army of the potomac in returning from the valley general lee had exhibited that combination of boldness and caution which indicates in a commander the possession of excellent generalship one of two courses was necessary either to make a rapid march with his entire army in order to interpose himself between general mcclellan and what seemed to be his objective point gordonsville or to so manoeuvre his forces as to retard and embarrass his adversary of these lee chose the latter course exposing himself to what seemed very great danger jackson was left in the valley and longstreet sent to culpepper under these circumstances general mcclellan might have cut off one of the two detached bodies but lee seems to have read the character of his adversary accurately and to have felt that a movement of such boldness would not probably be undertaken by him provision had nevertheless been made for this possible contingency jackson was directed by lee in case of an attack by general mcclellan to retire by way of strasburg up the valley and so rejoin the main body that this movement would become necessary however was not as we have said contemplated it was not supposed by lee that his adversary would adopt the bold plan of crossing the blue ridge to assail jackson thus to leave that commander in the valley instead of being a military blunder was a stroke of generalship a source of embarrassment to general mcclellan and a standing threat against the federal communications calculated to clog the movements of their army that lee aimed at this is obvious from his order to jackson to cross a division to the eastern side of the blue ridge in general mcclellans rear when this was done the federal commander abandoned if he had ever resolved upon the design of striking in between the confederate detachments as is claimed by his admirers to have been his determination gave up all idea of moving into the valley and endeavoring to gain their rear and from that moment directed his whole attention to the concentration of his army near warrenton with the obvious view of establishing a new base and operating southward on the line of the orange and alexandria railroad lees object in these manoeuvres besides the general one of embarrassing his adversary seems to have been to gain time and thus to render impossible from the lateness of the season a federal advance upon richmond had general mcclellan remained in command it is probable that this object would have been attained and the battle of fredericksburg would not have taken place the two armies would have lain opposite each other in culpepper and fauquier respectively with the upper rappahannock between them throughout the winter and the confederate forces weary and worn by the long marches and hard combats of 1862 would have had the opportunity to rest and recover their energies for the coming spring the change of commanders defeated these views if they were entertained by general lee on assuming command general burnside conceived the project in spite of the near approach of winter of crossing the rappahannock at fredericksburg and marching on richmond this he now proceeded to attempt by steadily moving from warrenton toward the lower rappahannock and the result as will be seen was a federal disaster to wind up this year of battles we have spoken with some * of the character and military abilities of general mcclellan the first able commander of the federal forces in virginia of general burnside who appears but once and for a brief space only on that great theatre it will be necessary to say only a few words a modest and honorable soldier cherishing for general mcclellan a cordial friendship he was unwilling to supersede that commander both from personal regard and distrust of his own abilities he had not sought the position which had rather been thrust upon him he was surprised and shocked he said at his assignment to the command he did not want it it had been offered to him twice before and he did not feel that he could take it he had told them that he was not competent to command such an army as this he had said the same over and over again to the president and the secretary of war he was however directed to assume command accepted the responsibility and proceeded to carry out the unexpected plan of advancing upon richmond by way of fredericksburg to cover this movement general burnside made a heavy feint as though designing to cross into culpepper this does not seem to have deceived lee who on the 17th of november knew that his adversary was moving no sooner had the fact been discovered that general burnside was making for fredericksburg than the confederate commander by a corresponding movement passed the rapidan and hastened in the same direction as early as the 17th two divisions of infantry with cavalry and artillery were in motion on the morning of the 19th longstreets corps was sent in the same direction and when on november 20th general burnside arrived with his army the federal forces drawn up on the hills north of fredericksburg saw on the highlands south of the city the red flags and gray lines of their old adversaries as general jackson had been promptly directed to join the main body and was already moving to do so lee would soon be able to oppose general burnside with his whole force such were the movements of the opposing armies which brought them face to face at fredericksburg lee had acted promptly and it would seem with good judgment but the question has been asked why he did not repeat against general burnside the strategic movement which had embarrassed general mcclellan and arrest the march upon fredericksburg by threatening with the detachment under jackson the federal rear the reasons for not adopting this course will be perceived by a glance at the map general burnside was taking up a new * creek on the * from the character of the country it was wholly impossible for lee to prevent him from doing so he had only to fall back before jackson or any force moving against his flank or rear the potomac was at hand and it was not in the power of lee to further annoy him the latter accordingly abandoned all thought of repeating his old manoeuvre moved longstreet and the other troops in culpepper toward fredericksburg and directing jackson to join him there thus concentrated his forces directly in the federal front with the view of fighting a pitched battle army against army this detailed account of lees movements may appear tedious to some readers but it was rather in grand tactics than in fighting battles that he displayed his highest abilities as a soldier he uniformly adopted the broadest and most judicious plan to bring on battle and personally directed as far as was possible every detail of his movements when the hour came it may be said of him that he felt he had done his * actual fighting was left largely in the hands of his corps commanders the feints and slight encounters preceding the battle of fredericksburg are not of much interest or importance general burnside sent a force to port royal about twentyfive miles below the city but lee promptly detached a portion of his army to meet it if it attempted to cross and that project was abandoned no attempt was made by general burnside to cross above and it became obvious that he must pass the river in face of lee or not at all such was the condition of affairs at fredericksburg in the first days of december to a correct understanding of the interesting battle of fredericksburg a brief description of the ground is essential the city lies on the south bank of the rappahannock which here makes a considerable bend nearly southward and along the northern bank opposite extends a range of hills which command the city and the level ground around it south of the river the land is low but from the depth of the channel forms a line of bluffs affording good shelter to troops after crossing to assail a force beyond the only good position for such a force standing on the defensive is a range of hills hemming in the level ground this range begins near the western suburbs of the city where it is called maryes hill and sweeps round to the southward gradually * from the stream until at hamiltons crossing on the richmond and potomac railroad a mile or more from the river it suddenly * into the plain this plain extends to the right and is bounded by the deep and difficult channel of massaponnax creek as maryes hill is the natural position for the left of an army posted to defend fredericksburg the crest above hamiltons crossing is the natural position for the right of such a line care being taken to cover the extreme right with artillery to obstruct the passage of the ground between the crest and the massaponnax behind the hills on the north side general burnsides army was posted having the railroad to * creek for the transportation of their supplies on the range of hills which we have described south of the city general lee was stationed the same railroad connecting him with richmond longstreets corps composed his left wing and extended from maryes hill to about the middle of the range of hills there jacksons line began forming the right wing and extending to the termination of the range at hamiltons crossing on jacksons right to guard the plain reaching to the massaponnax stuart was posted with cavalry and artillery the numbers of the adversaries at fredericksburg can be stated with accuracy upon one side but not upon the other general lees force may be said to have been in round numbers about fifty thousand of all arms it could scarcely have exceeded that unless he received heavy renforcements after sharpsburg and the present writer has never heard or read that he received renforcements of any description the number fifty thousand thus seems to have been the full amount of the army that of general burnsides forces seems to have been considerably larger the federal army consisted of the first second third fifth sixth ninth and eleventh corps the latter a corps of reserve and large if these had been recruited to the full number reported by general mcclellan at sharpsburg and the additional troops fifth and eleventh corps be estimated the federal army must have exceeded one hundred thousand men this estimate is borne out by federal authorities general franklin says a northern writer had now with him about onehalf the whole army and general meade says that franklins force amounted to from fiftyfive thousand to sixty thousand men which would seem to indicate that the whole army numbered from one hundred and ten thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand men a strong position was obviously essential to render it possible for the southern army of about fifty thousand men to successfully oppose the advance of this force of above one hundred thousand lee had found this position and constructed earthworks for artillery with the view of receiving the attack of the enemy after their crossing he was unable to obstruct this crossing in any material degree and he states clearly the grounds of this inability the plain of fredericksburg he says is so completely commanded by the stafford heights that no effectual opposition could be made to the construction of bridges or the passage of the river without exposing our troops to the destructive fire of the numerous batteries of the enemy our position was therefore selected with a view to resist the enemys advance after crossing and the river was guarded only by a force sufficient to impede his movements until the army could be concentrated the brief description we have presented of the character of the ground around fredericksburg and the position of the adversaries will sufficiently indicate the conditions under which the battle was fought both armies seem to have been in excellent spirits that of general burnside had made a successful march during which they had scarcely seen an enemy and now looked forward probably to certain if not easy victory general lees army in like manner had undergone recently no peculiar hardships in marching or fighting and to whatever cause the fact may be attributed was in a condition of the highest efficiency the men seemed to be confident of the result of the coming conflict and in their bivouacs on the line of battle in the woods * the ridge which they occupied laughed jested cheered on the slightest provocation and instead of shrinking from looked forward with eagerness to the moment when general burnside would advance to attack them this buoyant and elastic spirit in the southern troops was * on the eve of nearly every battle of the war whether it was due to the peculiar characteristics of the race or to other causes we shall not pause here to inquire but the fact was plain to the most casual observation and was never more striking than just before fredericksburg unless just preceding the battle of gettysburg nothing of any importance occurred from the 20th of november when general burnsides army was concentrated on the heights north of fredericksburg until the 11th of december when the federal army began crossing the rappahannock to deliver battle lees reasons for not attempting to resist the passage of the river have been given above the plain on which it would have been necessary to draw up his army in order to do so was too much exposed to the numerous artillery of the enemy on the northern bank lee resolved therefore not to oppose the crossing of the federal troops but to await their assault on the commanding ground west and south of the city on the morning of december 11th before dawn the dull boom of lees signalguns indicated that the enemy were moving and the southern troops formed line of battle to meet the coming attack general burnside had made arrangements to cross the river on pontoon bridges one opposite the city and another a mile or two lower down the stream general franklin commanding the two corps of the left grand division succeeded without trouble in laying the lower bridge as the ground did not permit lee to offer material obstruction and this large portion of the army was now ready to cross the passage of the stream at fredericksburg was more difficult although determined not to make a serious effort to prevent the enemy from crossing general lee had placed two regiments of barksdales mississippians along the bank of the river in the city to act as sharpshooters and impede the construction of the pontoon bridges with the view doubtless of thus giving time to marshal his troops the success of this device was considerable the workmen busily engaged in laying the federal pontoons were so much interrupted by the fire of the confederate * directed their aim through the heavy fog by the noise made in putting together the * after losing a number of men the federal commander discontinued his attempt it was renewed again and again without success as before when provoked apparently by the presence of this hornets nest which reversed all his plans general burnside about ten oclock opened a furious fire of artillery upon the city the extent of this bombardment will be understood from the statement that one hundred and fortyseven pieces of artillery were employed which fired seven thousand three hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition in one instance piercing a single small house with fifty * an eyewitness of this scene says the enemy had planted more than a hundred pieces of artillery on the hills to the northern and eastern sides of the town and from an early hour in the forenoon swept the streets with * shell and * firing frequently a hundred guns a minute the quick puffs of smoke touched in the centre with tongues of flame ran incessantly along the lines of their batteries on the slopes and as the smoke slowly drifted away the bellowing roar came up in one continuous roll the town was soon fired and a dense cloud of smoke enveloped its roofs and steeples the white * still rose serenely aloft defying shot or shell though a portion of one of them was torn off the smoke was succeeded by lurid flame and the crimson mass brought to mind the pictures of moscow burning the same writer says men women and children were driven from the town and hundreds of ladies and children were seen wandering homeless and without shelter over the frozen highway in thin clothing knowing not where to find a place of refuge general lee watched this painful spectacle from a redoubt to the right of the telegraph road not far from his centre where a shoulder * out from the ridge and now called lees hill afforded him a clear view of the city the destruction of the place and the suffering of the inhabitants aroused in him a deep melancholy mingled with exasperation and his comment on the scene was probably as bitter as any speech which he uttered during the whole war standing wrapped in his cape with only a few officers near he looked fixedly at the flames rising from the city and after remaining for a long time silent said in his grave deep voice these people delight to destroy the weak and those who can make no defence it just suits them general burnside continued the bombardment for some hours the mississippians still holding the riverbank and preventing the laying of the pontoons which was again begun and again discontinued at about four in the afternoon however a force was sent across in * and by nightfall the city was evacuated by lee and general burnside proceeded rapidly to lay his pontoon bridge upon which his army then began to pass over the crossing continued throughout the next day not materially obstructed by the fire of lees artillery as a dense fog rendered the aim of the cannoneers unreliable by nightfall of the 12th the federal army was over with the exception of general hookers centre grand division which was held in reserve on the north bank general burnside then proceeded to form his line of battle it stretched from the western suburbs of fredericksburg down the river along what is called the river road for a distance of about four miles and consisted of the right grand division under general sumner at the city and the left grand division under general franklin lower down and opposite lees right general franklins grand division numbered according to general meade from fiftyfive to sixty thousand men the numbers of generals sumner and hooker are not known to the present writer but are said by federal authorities as we have stated to have amounted together to about the same at daybreak on the morning of december 13th a muffled sound issuing from the dense fog covering the low ground indicated that the federal lines were preparing to advance to enable the reader to understand general burnsides plan of attack it is necessary that brief extracts should be presented from his orders on the occasion and from his subsequent testimony before the committee on the conduct of the war despite the length of time since his arrival at * period of more than three * federal commander had it appears been unable to obtain full and accurate information of the character of the ground occupied by lee and thus moved very much in the dark he seems to have formed his plan of attack in consequence of information from a colored man his words are the enemy had cut a road along in the rear of the line of heights where we made our attack i obtained from a colored man at the other side of the town information in regard to this new road which proved to be correct i wanted to obtain possession of that new road and that was my reason for making an attack on the extreme left it is difficult for those familiar with the ground referred to to understand how this new road a mere country bridlepath as it were extending along in the rear of lees right wing could have been regarded as a topographical feature of any importance the road which remains unchanged and may be seen by any one today was insignificant in a military point of view and in attaching such importance to seizing it the federal commander committed a grave error what seems to have been really judicious in his plan was the turning movement determined on against lees right along the old richmond road running from the direction of the river past the end of the ridge occupied by the confederates and so southward to break through at this point was the only hope of success and general burnside had accordingly resolved he declared upon a rapid movement down the old richmond road with franklins large command unfortunately however this wise design was complicated with another most unwise to send forward a division first to seize the crest of the ridge near the point where it sinks into the plain on this crest were posted the veterans of jackson commanded in person by that skilful soldier three lines of infantry supported by artillery were ready to receive the federal attack and to force back this stubborn obstacle general burnside sent a division the proof is found in his order to general franklin at about six oclock on the morning of the battle send out a division at least to seize if possible the heights near captain hamiltons which was the ground whereon jacksons right rested an attack on the formidable position known as maryes hill on lees left west of fredericksburg was also directed to be made by the same small force the order to general sumner was to form a column of a division for the purpose of pushing in the direction of the telegraph and plank roads for the purpose of seizing the heights in the rear of the town or according to another version up the plank road to its intersection with the telegraph road where they will divide with the object of seizing the heights on both sides of those roads the point of intersection here referred to was the locality of what has been called that sombre fatal terrible stone wall just under maryes hill where the most fearful slaughter of the federal forces took place maryes hill is a strong position and its importance was well understood by lee longstreets infantry was in heavy line of battle behind it and the crest bristled with artillery there was still less hope here of effecting any thing with a division than on the confederate right held by jackson general burnside seems however to have regarded success as probable he added in his order holding these heights with the heights near captain hamiltons will i hope compel the enemy to evacuate the whole ridge between these points in his testimony afterward he said that in the event of failure in these assaults on lees flanks he proposed to make a direct attack on their front and drive them out of their works these extracts from general burnsides orders and testimony clearly indicate his plan which was to assail both lees right and left and in the event of failure direct a heavy blow at his centre that the whole plan completely failed was mainly due it would seem to the inconsiderable numbers of the assaulting columns we return now to the narrative of the battle which these comments have interrupted general lee was ready to receive the federal attack and at an early hour of the morning rode from his headquarters in rear of his centre along his line of battle toward the right where he probably expected the main assault of the enemy to take place he was clad in his plain * gray uniform with felt hat * and short cape without sword and almost without any indications of his rank in these outward details he differed much from generals jackson and stuart who rode with him the latter as was usual with him wore a * uniform sash black plume sabre and handsome gauntlets general jackson also on this day chanced to have exchanged his dingy old coat and * * for a new coat covered with dazzling buttons and a cap brilliant with a broad band of gold lace in which for him extraordinary disguise his men scarcely knew him as lee and his companions passed along in front of the line of battle the troops cheered them it was evident that the army was in excellent spirits and ready for the hard work which the day would bring lee proceeded down the old richmond or stage * mentioned in general burnsides order as the one over which his large flanking column was to * rode on with stuart until he was near the river road running toward fredericksburg parallel to the federal line of battle here he stopped and endeavored to make out through the dense fog covering the plain whether the federal forces were moving a stifled hum issued from the mist but nothing could be seen it seemed however that the enemys * concealed in the ditches along the river * sharper eyes as bullets began to whistle around the two generals and soon a number of black specks were seen moving forward general lee remained for some time longer in spite of the exposure conversing with great calmness and gravity with stuart who was all ardor he then rode back slowly passed along his line of battle greeted wherever he was seen with cheers and took his position on the eminence in his centre near the telegraph road the same commanding point from which he had witnessed the bombardment of fredericksburg the battle did not commence until ten oclock owing to the dense fog through which the light of the sun could scarcely pierce at that hour the mist lifted and rolled away and the confederates posted on the ridge saw a heavy column of infantry advancing to attack their right near the hamilton house this force was meades division supported by gibbons with a third in reserve general franklin having put in action as many troops as his orders a division at least permitted general meade was arrested for some time by a minute but most annoying obstacle stuart had placed a single piece of artillery under major john pelham near the point where the old richmond and river roads * is directly on the flank of the advancing * this gun now opened a rapid and determined fire upon general meade major * a boy in * to hold his exposed position with great gallantry although the enemy opened fire upon him with several batteries killing a number of his gunners general lee witnessed this duel from the hill on which he had taken his stand and is said to have exclaimed it is glorious to see such courage in one so young pelham continued the cannonade for about two hours only retiring when he received a peremptory order from jackson to do so and it would seem that this one gun caused a considerable delay in the attack meade advanced across the plain but had not proceeded far says mr swinton before he was compelled to stop and silence a battery that stuart had posted on the port royal road having brushed away this annoying obstacle general meade with a force which he states to have amounted to ten thousand men advanced rapidly to attack the hill upon which the confederates awaited him he was suffered to approach within a few hundred yards when jacksons artillery under colonel walker posted near the end of the ridge opened a sudden and furious fire which threw the federal line into temporary confusion the troops soon rallied however and advanced again to the attack which fell on jacksons front line under ap hill the struggle which now ensued was fierce and bloody but a gap having been left between the brigades of archer and lane the enemy pierced the opening turning the left of one brigade and the right of the other pressed on attacked greggs brigade of hills reserve threw it into confusion and seemed about to carry the crest greggs brigade was quickly rallied however by its brave commander who soon afterward fell mortally wounded the further progress of the enemy was checked and jacksons second line rapidly advancing the enemy were met and forced back step by step until they were driven down the slope again here they were attacked by the brigades of hoke and atkinson and driven beyond the railroad the confederates cheering and following them into the plain the repulse had been complete and the slope and ground in front of it were strewed with federal dead they had returned as rapidly as they had charged pursued by shot and shell and general lee witnessing the spectacle from his hill murmured in his grave and measured voice it is well this is so terrible we should grow too fond of it the assault on the confederate right had thus ended in disaster but almost immediately another attack took place whose results were more bloody and terrible still as general meade fell back pursued by the men of jackson the sudden roar of artillery from the confederate left indicated that a heavy conflict had begun in that quarter the federal troops were charging maryes hill which was to prove the cemetery hill of fredericksburg this frightful * no other * can describe * made by general frenchs division supported by general hancock the federal troops rushed forward over the broken ground in the suburbs of the city and as soon as the masses became dense enough were received with a concentrated artillery fire from the hill in front of them this fire was so destructive that it made gaps that could be seen at the distance of a mile the charging division had advanced in column of brigades and the front was nearly destroyed the troops continued to move forward however and had nearly reached the base of the hill when the brigades of cobb and cooke posted behind a stone wall running parallel with the telegraph road met them with a sudden fire of musketry which drove them back in terrible disorder nearly half the force was killed or lay disabled on the field and upon the survivors now in full retreat was directed a concentrated artilleryfire from the hill in face of this discharge of cannon general hancocks force supporting french now gallantly advanced in its turn the charge lasted about fifteen minutes and in that time general hancock lost more than two thousand of the five thousand men of his command the repulse was still more bloody and decisive than the first the second column fell back in disorder leaving the ground covered with their dead general burnside had hitherto remained at the phillips house a mile or more from the rappahannock he now mounted his horse and riding down to the river dismounted walked up and down in great agitation and exclaimed looking at maryes hill that crest must be carried tonight in spite of the murderous results of the first charges the federal commander determined on a third general hookers reserve was ordered to make it and although that officer protested against it general burnside was immovable and repeated his order general hooker sullenly obeyed and opened with artillery upon the stone wall at the foot of the hill in order to make a breach in it this fire continued until nearly sunset when humphreys division was formed for the charge the men were ordered to throw aside their knapsacks and not to load their guns for there was no time there to load and fire says general hooker the word was given about sunset and the division charged headlong over the ground already covered with dead a few words will convey the result of four thousand men who charged seventeen hundred and sixty were left dead or wounded on the field the rest retreated pursued by the fire of the batteries and infantry and night fell on the battlefield this charge was the real termination of the bloody battle of fredericksburg but on the confederate right jackson had planned and begun to execute a decisive advance on the force in his front this he designed to undertake precisely at sunset and his intention was to depend on the bayonet his military judgment or instinct having satisfied him that the morale of the federal army was destroyed the advance was discontinued however in consequence of the lateness of the hour and the sudden artilleryfire which saluted him as he began to move a striking feature of this intended advance is the fact that jackson had placed his artillery in front of his line of battle intending to attack in that manner as darkness settled down the last guns of stuart who had defended the confederate right flank with about thirty pieces of artillery were heard far in advance and apparently advancing still the federal lines had fallen back wellnigh to the banks of the river and there seems little room to doubt that the morale of the men was seriously impaired from what i knew of our want of success upon the right says general franklin when interrogated on this point and the demoralized condition of the troops upon the right and centre as represented to me by their commanders i confess i believe the order to recross was a very proper one general burnside refused to give the order and nearly overwhelmed apparently by the fatal result of the attack determined to form the ninth corps in column of regiments and lead it in person against maryes hill on the next morning such a design in a soldier of ability indicates desperation to charge maryes hill with a corps in column of regiments was to devote the force to destruction it was nearly certain that the whole command would be torn to pieces by the southern artillery but general burnside seems to have regarded the possession of the hill as worth any amount of blood and in face of the urgent appeals of his officers gave orders for the movement at the last moment however he yielded to the entreaties of general sumner and abandoned his bloody design still it seemed that the federal commander was unable to come to the mortifying resolution of recrossing the rappahannock the battle was fought on the 13th of december and until the night of the 15th general burnside continued to face lee on the south bank of the * bands playing his flags flying and nothing indicating an intention of retiring to that resolve he had however come and on the night of the 15th in the midst of storm and darkness the federal army recrossed to the north bank of the rappahannock the battle of fredericksburg was another defeat of the federal programme of invasion as decisive and in one sense as disastrous as the second battle of manassas general burnside had not lost as many men as general pope and had not retreated in confusion pursued by a victorious enemy but brief as the conflict had * or three hours summing up all the real * desperate character and the evident hopelessness of any attempt to storm lees position profoundly discouraged and demoralized the northern troops we have quoted the statement of general franklin commanding the whole left wing that from the demoralized condition of the troops upon the right and centre as represented to him by their commanders he believed the order to recross was a very proper one nor is there any ground to suppose that the feeling of the left wing was greatly better that wing of the army had not suffered as heavily as the right which had recoiled with such frightful slaughter from maryes hill but the repulse of general meade in their own front had been equally decisive and the * of the right must have * on the left discouraging that also northern writers in a position to ascertain the condition of the troops fully bear out this view that the morale of the army of the potomac became seriously impaired after the disaster at fredericksburg says mr swinton the able and candid historian of the campaign was only too manifest indeed it would be impossible to imagine a graver or * a more sombre or * body of men than the army of the potomac a month after the battle and as the days went by despondency discontent and all evil * with their natural consequent desertion seemed to increase rather than to diminish until for the first time the army of the potomac could be said to be really demoralized general sumner noticed that a spirit of croaking had become diffused throughout the forces for an army to display that tendency clearly indicates that the troops have lost the most important element of * in themselves and their leader and for this sentiment there was valid reason columns wholly inadequate in numbers had been advanced against the formidable confederate positions positions so strong and well defended that it is doubtful if thrice the force could have made any impression upon them and the result was such as might have been expected the men lost confidence in the military capacity of their commander and in their own powers after the double repulse at maryes hill and in front of jackson the troops looking at the ground strewed with dead and wounded were in no condition to go forward hopefully to another struggle which promised to be equally bloody the southern army was naturally in a condition strongly in contrast with that of their adversary they had repulsed the determined assault of the federal columns with comparative ease on both flanks jacksons first line although pierced and driven back soon rallied and checked the enemy until the second line came up when general meade was driven back the third line not having moved from its position along the road near the hamilton house on the left longstreet had repulsed the federal charge with his artillery and two small brigades the loss of the confederates in both these encounters was much less than that of their adversaries a natural result of the circumstances and thus instead of sharing the depression of their opponents the southern troops were elated and looked forward to a renewal of the battle with confidence in themselves and in their leader it is not necessary to offer much comment upon the manner in which general burnside had attacked he is said by his critics not to have at the time designed the turning movement against general lees right upon which point the present writer is unable to decide that movement would seem to have presented the sole and only chance of success for the federal arms as the successful advance of general franklins fiftyfive or sixty thousand men up the old richmond road would have compelled lee to retire his whole right wing to protect it from an assault in flank and reverse what dispositions he would have made under these circumstances must be left to conjecture but it is certain that the blow would have proved a serious one calling for the display of all his military ability in the event however that this was the main great aim of general burnside his method of carrying out his design insured it would seem its failure ten thousand men only were to clear the way for the flanking movement in order to effect which object it was necessary to crush jackson so that it may be said that the success of the plan involved the repulse of onehalf lees army with ten thousand men the assault on maryes hill was an equally fatal military mistake that the position could not be stormed is proved by the result of the actual attempt it is doubtful if in any battle ever fought by any troops men displayed greater gallantry they rushed headlong not only once but thrice into the * of a frightful front and cross fire of artillery and smallarms losing nearly half their numbers in a few minutes the ground was * with their dead and yet the foremost had only been able to approach within sixty yards of the terrible stone wall in advance of the hill there they fell throwing up their hands to indicate that they saw at last that the attempt to carry the hill was hopeless these comments seem justified by the circumstances and are made with no intention of casting * upon the commander who displaying little ability gave evidences of unfaltering courage he had urged his inability to handle so large an army but the authorities had forced the command upon him he had accepted it and done his best and like a brave soldier determined to lead the final charge in person dying if necessary at the head of his men general lee has not escaped criticism any more than general burnside the southern people were naturally dissatisfied with the * safe retreat of the federal * asked why they had not been attacked and captured or destroyed the london times at that period and a military critic recently in the same journal declared that lee had it in his power to crush general burnside horse foot and dragoons and from his failure to do so argued his want of great generalship a full discussion of the question is left by the present writer to those better skilled than himself in military science it is proper however to insert here general lees own explanation of his action the attack on the 13th he says had been so easily repulsed and by so small a part of our army that it was not supposed the enemy would limit his efforts to one attempt which in view of the magnitude of his preparations and the extent of his force seemed to be comparatively insignificant believing therefore that he would attack us it was not deemed expedient to lose the advantages of our position and expose the troops to the fire of his inaccessible batteries beyond the river by advancing against him but we were necessarily ignorant of the extent to which he had suffered and only became aware of it when on the morning of the 16th it was discovered that he had availed himself of the darkness of night and the * of a violent storm of wind and rain to recross the river this statement was no doubt framed by general lee to meet the criticisms which the result of the battle occasioned in conversing with general stuart on the subject he added that he felt too great responsibility for the preservation of his troops to unnecessarily hazard them no one knows he said how brittle an army is the word may appear strange applied to the army of northern virginia which had certainly vindicated its claim under many arduous trials to the virtues of * and endurance but lees meaning was plain and his view seems to have been founded on good sense the enemy had in all probably two hundred pieces of artillery a large portion of which were posted on the high ground north of the river had lee descended from his ridge and advanced into the plain to attack this large number of guns would have greeted him with a rapid and destructive fire which must have inflicted upon him a loss as nearly heavy as he had inflicted upon general burnside at maryes hill from such a result he naturally shrunk it has been seen that the federal troops brave as they were had been demoralized by such a fire and lee was unwilling to expose his own troops to similar slaughter there is little question it seems that an advance of the description mentioned would have resulted in a conclusive victory and the probable surrender of the whole or a large portion of the federal army whether the probability of such a result was sufficient to compensate for the certain slaughter the reader will decide for himself general lee did not think so and did not order the advance he preferred awaiting in his strong position the second assault which general burnside would probably make and while he thus waited the enemy secretly recrossed the river rendering an attack upon them by lee impossible general burnside made a second movement to cross the * time at bankss ford above * the inclement month of january but as he might have anticipated the condition of the roads was such that it was impossible to advance his artillery with the horses dragging the pieces sank into the almost * mud where they stuck * the * found it difficult to march through the * the whole movement was speedily abandoned when general burnside issued the order for this injudicious advance two of his general officers met and one asked what do you think of it it dont seem to have the ring was the reply * bell is broken the other added this incident which is given on the authority of a northern writer probably conveys a correct idea of the feeling of both the officers and men of general burnsides army the disastrous day of fredericksburg had seriously injured the troops the army of the potomac the writer adds was sadly fractured and its tones had no longer the clear inspiring ring of victory the stormy year 1862 had terminated thus in a great confederate success in its arduous campaigns following each other in rapid succession general lee had directed the movements of the main great army and the result of the years fighting was to gain him that high military reputation which his subsequent movements only consolidated and increased a rapid glance at the events of the year in their general outlines will indicate the merit due the southern commander the federal plan of invasion in the spring had been extremely formidable virginia was to be pierced by no less than four * the northwest the shenandoah valley the potomac and the * whole force to converge upon richmond the heart of the rebellion of these the army of general mcclellan was the largest and most threatening it advanced with little opposition until it reached the chickahominy crossed and lay in sight of richmond the great force of one hundred and fifty thousand men was about to make the decisive assault when lee attacked it and the battle which ensued drove the federal army to a point thirty miles from the city with such loss as to render hopeless any further attempt to assail the capital such was the first act of the drama the rest speedily followed a new army was raised promptly by the federal authorities and a formidable advance was made against richmond again this time from the direction of alexandria lee was watching general mcclellan when intelligence of the new movement reached him remaining with a portion of his troops near richmond he sent jackson to the rapidan the battle of cedar mountain resulted in the repulse of general popes vanguard and discovering at last that the real danger lay in the direction of culpepper lee moved thither drove back general pope flanked him and in the severe battle of manassas routed his army which was forced to retire upon washington two armies had thus been driven from the soil of virginia and the confederate commander had moved into maryland in order to draw the enemy thither and if practicable transfer the war to the heart of pennsylvania unforeseen circumstances had defeated the latter of these objects the concentration on sharpsburg was rendered necessary an * battle ensued there and not defeated but forced to abandon further movements toward pennsylvania lee had retired into virginia where he remained facing his adversary this was the first failure of lee up to that point in the campaigns of the year and an attentive consideration of the circumstances will show that the result was not fairly attributable to any error which he had committed events beyond his control had shaped his action and directed all his movements and it will remain a question whether the * of his small force from its difficult position did not better prove lees generalship than the victory at manassas the subsequent operations of the opposing armies indicated clearly that the southern forces were still in excellent fighting condition and the movements of lee during the advance of general mcclellan toward warrenton were highly honorable to his military ability with a force much smaller than that of his adversary he greatly embarrassed and impeded the federal advance confronted them on the upper rappahannock completely checking their forward movement in that direction and when they moved rapidly to fredericksburg crossed the rapidan promptly reappearing in their front on the range of hills opposite that city the battle which followed compensated for the failure of the maryland campaign and the drawn battle of sharpsburg general burnside had attacked and sustained decisive defeat the stormy year so filled with great events and arduous encounters had thus wound up with a pitched battle in which the enemy suffered a bloody repulse and the best commentary on the decisive character of this last struggle of the year was the fault found with general lee for not destroying his adversary in less than six months lee had thus fought four great pitched * victories to his arms with the exception of sharpsburg which was neither a victory nor a defeat the result was thus highly encouraging to the south and had the army of northern virginia had its ranks filled up as the ranks of the northern armies were the events of the year 1862 would have laid the foundation of assured success an inquiry into the causes of failure in this particular is not necessary to the subject of the volume before the reader it is only necessary to state the fact that the army of northern virginia defending what all conceded to be the territory on which the decisive struggle must take place was never sufficiently numerous to follow up the victories achieved by it at the battles of the chickahominy the army numbered at most about seventyfive thousand at the second manassas about fifty thousand at sharpsburg less than forty thousand and at fredericksburg about fifty thousand in the following year it will be seen that these latter numbers were at first but little exceeded and as the months passed on that they dwindled more and more until in april 1865 the whole force in line of battle at petersburg was scarcely more than thirty thousand men such had been the number of the troops under command of lee in 1862 the reader has been informed of the number of the federal force opposed to him this was one hundred and fifty thousand on the chickahominy of whom one hundred and fifteen thousand were effective about one hundred thousand it would seem under general pope at the second battle of manassas eightyseven thousand actually engaged at the battle of sharpsburg and at fredericksburg from one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty thousand these numbers are stated on the authority of federal officers or historians and lees force on the authority of his own reports or of gentlemen of high character in a situation to speak with accuracy of the truth of the statements the writer of these pages can have no doubt and if the fighting powers of the northern and southern troops be estimated as equal the fair conclusion must be arrived at that lee surpassed his adversaries in generalship the result at least of the years fighting had been extremely encouraging to the south and after the battle of fredericksburg no attempts were made to prosecute hostilities during the remainder of the year the scheme of crossing above fredericksburg proved a fiasco beginning and ending in a day thereafter all movements ceased and the two armies awaited the return of spring for further operations before passing to the great campaigns of the spring and summer of 1863 we propose to say a few words of general lee in his private and personal character and to attempt to indicate the position which he occupied at this time in the eyes of the army and the country unknown save by reputation when he assumed command of the forces in june 1862 he had now by the winter of the same year become one of the bestknown personages in the south neither the troops nor the people had perhaps penetrated the full character of lee and they seem to have attributed to him more reserve and less warmth and impulse than he possessed but it was impossible for a human being occupying so prominent a station before the general eye to hide in any material degree his main great characteristics and these had conciliated for lee an exalted and wellnigh universal public regard he was felt by all to be an individual of great dignity sincerity and earnestness in the performance of duty destitute plainly of that vulgar ambition which seeks personal aggrandizement rather than the general good and dedicated as plainly heart and soul to the cause for which he fought he had won even from those who had denounced him for the supposed hesitation in his course in april 1861 and had afterward criticised his military operations the repute of a truly great man as well as of a commander of the first ability it was felt by all classes that the dignity of the southern cause was adequately represented in the person and character of the commander of her most important army while others as brave and patriotic no doubt but of different temperament had permitted themselves to become violent and embittered in their private and public utterances in reference to the north lee had remained calm moderate and dignified under every provocation his reports were without * or exaggeration and his tone uniformly modest composed and * after his most decisive successes his pulse had remained calm he had written of those successes with the air of one who sees no especial merit in any thing which he has performed and so marked was this tone of moderation and dignity that in reading his official reports today it seems wellnigh impossible that they could have been written in the hot atmosphere of a war which aroused the bitterest passions of the human soul upon this point of lees personal and official dignity it is unnecessary to dwell further as the quality has long since been conceded by every one acquainted with the character of the individual in the old world and the new it is the trait perhaps the most prominent to the observer looking back now upon the individual and it was doubtless this august moderation dignity and apparent exemption from natural infirmity which produced the impression upon many persons that lee was cold and * we shall speak in future at greater length of his real character than is necessary in this place but it may here be said that the fancy that he was cold and * was a very great error no man had stronger or warmer feelings or regarded the invasion of the south with greater indignation than himself the sole difference was that he had his feelings under greater control and permitted no temptation to overcome his sense of that august dignity and composure becoming in the chief leader of a great people struggling for independent government the sentiment of the southern people toward lee may be summed up in the statement that they regarded him in his personal and private character with an admiration which was becoming unbounded and reposed in him as commander of the army the most implicit confidence these expressions are strong but they do not convey more than the truth and this confidence was never withdrawn from him it remained as strong in his hours of disaster as in his * of success a few * or desponding people might lose heart indulge in croaking and denounce under their breath the commander of the army as responsible for failure when it occurred but these * people were in a small minority and had little encouragement in their muttered criticisms the southern people from virginia to the utmost limits of the gulf states resolutely persisted in regarding lee as one of the greatest soldiers of history and retained their confidence in him unimpaired to the end the army had set the example of this implicit reliance upon lee as the chief leader and military head of the confederacy the brave fightingmen had not taken his reputation on trust but had seen him win it fairly on some of the * fields of history the heavy blow at general mcclellan on the chickahominy had first shown the troops that they were under command of a thorough soldier the rout of pope at manassas had followed in the ensuing month at sharpsburg with less than forty thousand men lee had repulsed the attack of nearly ninety thousand and at fredericksburg general burnsides great force had been driven back with inconsiderable loss to the southern army these successes in the eyes of the troops were the proofs of true leadership and it did not detract from lees popularity that on all occasions he had carefully refrained from unnecessary exposure of the troops especially at fredericksburg where an ambitious commander would have spared no amount of bloodshed to complete his glory by a great victory such was lees repute as army commander in the eyes of men accustomed to close scrutiny of their leaders he was regarded as a thorough soldier at once brave wise cool resolute and devoted heart and soul to the cause personally the commanderinchief was also by this time extremely popular he did not mingle with the troops to any great extent nor often relax the air of dignity somewhat tinged with reserve which was natural with him this reserve however never amounted to stiffness or official coolness on the contrary lee was * free from the chill demeanor of the martinet and had become greatly endeared to the men by the unmistakable evidences which he had given them of his honesty sincerity and kindly feeling for them it cannot indeed be said that he sustained the same relation toward the troops as general jackson for the latter illustrious soldier the men had a species of familiar affection the result in a great degree of the informal and often eccentric demeanor of the individual there was little or nothing in jackson to indicate that he was an officer holding important command he was without reserve and exhibited none of that formal courtesy which characterized lee his manners on the contrary were quite informal familiar and conciliated in return a familiar regard we repeat the word familiar as conveying precisely the idea intended to be expressed it indicated the difference between these two great soldiers in their outward appearance lee retained about him upon all occasions more or less of the commanderinchief passing before the troops on an excellent and * horse his figure erect and graceful in the saddle for he was one of the best riders in the army his demeanor grave and thoughtful his whole bearing that of a man intrusted with great responsibilities and the general care of the whole army jacksons personal appearance and air were very different his dress was generally dingy a faded * tilted over his eyes causing him to raise his chin into the air his stirrups were apt to be too short and his knees were thus elevated * and he would * along on his rawboned horse with a singularly * expression of countenance raising from time to time his right hand and * his knee this brief outline of the two commanders will serve to show the difference between them personally and it must be added that jacksons eccentric bearing was the source in some degree of his popularity the men admired him immensely for his great military ability and his odd ways procured for him that familiar liking to which we have alluded it is not intended however in these observations to convey the idea that general lee was regarded as a stiff and unapproachable personage of whom the private soldiers stood in awe such a statement would not express the truth lee was perfectly * and no instance is upon record or ever came to the knowledge of the present writer in which he repelled the approach of his men or received the humblest of them with any thing but kindness he was naturally simple and kind with great gentleness and patience and it will not be credible to any who knew the man that he ever made any difference in his treatment of those who approached him from a consideration of their rank in the army his theory expressed upon many occasions was that the private * who fought without the * of rank emolument or individual * the most meritorious class of the army and that they deserved and should receive the utmost respect and consideration this statement however is doubtless unnecessary men of lees pride and dignity never make a difference in their treatment of men because one is humble and the other of high rank of such human beings it may be said that noblesse oblige the men of the army had thus found their commander all that they could wish and his increasing personal popularity was shown by the greater frequency with which they now spoke of him as marse robert old uncle robert and by other familiar titles this tendency in troops is always an indication of personal regard these * had been already showered upon jackson and general lee was having his turn the troops regarded him now more as their * than formerly having found that his dignity was not coldness and that he would under no temptation indulge his personal convenience or fare better than themselves it was * know not with what * the habit of northern generals in the war was to look assiduously to their individual comfort in selecting their quarters and to take pleasure in surrounding themselves with glittering staffofficers * and other indications of their rank and the consideration which they expected in these particulars lee differed extremely from his opponents and there were no evidences whatever at his headquarters that he was the commanderinchief or even an officer of high rank he uniformly lived in a tent in spite of the urgent invitations of citizens to use their houses for his headquarters and this refusal was the result both of an indisposition to expose these gentlemen to annoyance from the enemy when he himself retired and of a rooted objection to fare better than his troops they had tents only often indeed were without even that much covering and it was repugnant to lees feelings to sleep under a good roof when the troops were so much exposed his headquarters tent at this time december 1862 as before and afterward was what is called a * not differing in any particular from those used by the private soldiers of the army in winterquarters it was pitched in an opening in the wood near the narrow road leading to hamiltons crossing with the tents of the officers of the staff grouped near and with the exception of an orderly who always waited to summon couriers to carry dispatches there was nothing in the shape of a bodyguard visible or any indication that the unpretending group of tents was the army headquarters within no article of luxury was to be seen a few plain and indispensable objects were all which the tent contained the covering of the commanderinchief was an ordinary army blanket and his fare was plainer perhaps than that of the majority of his officers and men this was the result of an utter indifference in lee to personal convenience or indulgence citizens frequently sent him delicacies boxes filled with turkeys hams wine * and other things peculiarly tempting to one leading the hard life of the soldier but these were almost uniformly sent to the sick in some neighboring hospital lees principle in so acting seems to have been to set the good example to his officers of not * better than their men but he was undoubtedly indifferent naturally to luxury of all descriptions in his habits and feelings he was not the selfindulgent man of peace but the thorough soldier willing to live hard to sleep upon the ground and to disregard all * indulgence in his other habits he was equally * he cared nothing for wine whiskey or any stimulant and never used tobacco in any form he rarely relaxed his energies in any thing calculated to amuse him but when not riding along his lines or among the camps to see in person that the troops were properly cared for generally passed his time in close attention to official duties connected with the wellbeing of the army or in correspondence with the authorities at richmond when he relaxed from this continuous toil it was to indulge in some quiet and simple diversion social converse with ladies in houses at which he chanced to stop caresses bestowed upon children with whom he was a great favorite and frequently in informal conversation with his officers at * and moss neck two hospitable houses below fredericksburg he at this time often stopped and spent some time in the society of the ladies and children there one of the latter a little * girl would come up to him always to receive her accustomed kiss and one day confided to him as a personal friend her desire to kiss general jackson who blushed like a girl when lee with a quiet laugh told him of the childs wish on another occasion when his small friend came to receive his caress he said laughing that she would show more taste in selecting a younger gentleman than himself and pointing to a youthful officer in a corner of the room added there is the handsome major pelham which caused that modest young soldier to blush with confusion the bearing of general lee in these hours of relaxation was quite charming and made him warm friends his own pleasure and gratification were plain and gratified others who in the simple and kindly gentleman in the plain gray uniform found it difficult to recognize the commanderinchief of the southern army these moments of relaxation were however only occasional all the rest was toil and the routine of hard work and grave * went on month after month and year after year with little interruption with the exceptions which we have noted all pleasures and * seemed of little interest to lee and to the present writer at least he seemed on all occasions to bear the most striking resemblance to the traditional idea of washington high principle and devotion to duty were plainly this human beings springs of action and he went through the hard and continuous labor incident to army command with a grave and systematic attention wholly indifferent it seemed to almost every species of diversion and relaxation this attempt to show how lee appeared at that time to his * has extended to undue length and we shall be compelled to defer a full notice of the most interesting and beautiful trait of his character this was his humble and profound piety the world has by no means done him justice upon this subject no one doubted during the war that general lee was a sincere christian in conviction and his exemplary moral character and life were beyond criticism beyond this it is doubtful if any save his intimate associates understood the depth of his feeling on the greatest of all subjects jacksons strong religious fervor was known and often alluded to but it is doubtful if lee was regarded as a person of equally fervent convictions and feelings and yet the fact is certain that faith in gods providence and reliance upon the almighty were the foundation of all his actions and the secret of his supreme composure under all trials he was naturally of such reserve that it is not singular that the extent of this sentiment was not understood even then however good men who frequently visited him and conversed with him upon religious subjects came away with their hearts burning within them when the rev j william jones with another clergyman went in 1863 to consult him in reference to the better observance of the sabbath in the army his eye brightened and his whole countenance glowed with pleasure and as in his simple feeling words he expressed his delight we forgot the great warrior and only remembered that we were communing with an humble earnest christian when he was informed that the chaplains prayed for him tears started to his eyes and he replied i sincerely thank you for that and i can only say that i am a poor sinner trusting in christ alone and that i need all the prayers you can offer for me on the day after this interview he issued an earnest general order * the observance of the sabbath by officers and men urging them to attend public worship in their camps and forbidding the performance on sunday of all official duties save those necessary to the subsistence or safety of the army he always attended public worship if it were in his power to do so and often the earnestness of the preacher would make his eye kindle and his face glow he frequently attended the meetings of his chaplains took a warm interest in the proceedings and uniformly exhibited declares one who could speak from personal knowledge an ardent desire for the promotion of religion in the army he did not fail on many occasions to show his men that he was a sincere christian when general meade came over to mine run and the southern army marched to meet him lee was riding along his line of battle in the woods when he came upon a party of soldiers holding a prayermeeting on the eve of battle such a spectacle was not unusual in the army then and * rough fighters were often men of profound * on this occasion the sight before him seems to have excited deep emotion in lee he stopped * staffofficers accompanying him did the * lee uncovered his head and stood in an attitude of profound respect and attention while the earnest prayer proceeded in the midst of the thunder of artillery and the explosion of the enemys shells other incidents indicating the simple and earnest piety of lee will be presented in the course of this narrative the fame of the soldier has in some degree thrown into the background the * trait of personal piety in the individual no * of lee however would be complete without a full statement of his religious principles and feelings as the commanderinchief of the army of northern virginia he won that august renown which * his name with a halo of military glory both in america and europe his battles and victories are known to all men it is not known to all that the illustrious soldier whose fortune it was to overthrow one after another the best soldiers of the federal army was a simple humble and devoted christian whose eyes filled with tears when he was informed that his chaplains prayed for him and who said i am a poor sinner trusting in christ alone and need all the prayers you can offer for me lee remained throughout the winter at his headquarters in the woods south of fredericksburg watching the northern army which continued to occupy the country north of the city with the potomac river as their base of supplies with the coming of spring it was obviously the intention of the federal authorities to again essay the crossing of the rappahannock at some point either above or below fredericksburg and as the movement above was less difficult and promised more decisive results it was seen by general lee that this would probably be the quarter from which he might expect an attack general stuart a soldier of sound judgment said during the winter the next battle will take place at chancellorsville and the position of lees troops seemed to indicate that this was also his own opinion his right remained still opposite fredericksburg barring the direct approach to richmond but his left extended up the rappahannock beyond chancellorsville and all the fords were vigilantly guarded to prevent a sudden flank movement by the enemy in that direction as will be seen the anticipations of lee were to be fully realized the heavy blow aimed at him in the first days of spring was to come from the quarter in which he had expected it the federal army was now under command of general joseph hooker an officer of dash energy excellent administrative capacity and northern writers add extremely prone to * general hooker had harshly criticised the military operations both of general mcclellan on the chickahominy and of general burnside at fredericksburg and so strong an impression had these strictures made upon the minds of the authorities that they came to the determination of * the command of the army to the officer who made them doubtless concluding that his own success would prove greater than that of his predecessors this opinion seemed borne out by the first proceedings of general hooker he set to work energetically to reorganize and increase the efficiency of the army did away with general burnsides defective grand division arrangement consolidated the cavalry into an effective corps enforced strict discipline among officers and men alike and at the beginning of spring had brought his army to a high state of efficiency his confident tone inspired the men the depression resulting from the great disaster at fredericksburg was succeeded by a spirit of buoyant hope and the army was once more that great * ready for any undertaking which it had been under mcclellan it numbered according to one federal statement one hundred and * thousand three hundred men but according to another which appears more reliable one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and artillery and twelve thousand cavalry in all one hundred and thirtytwo thousand troops the army of general lee was considerably smaller two divisions of longstreets corps had been sent to suffolk south of james river to obtain supplies in that region and this force was not present at the battle of chancellorsville the actual numbers under lees command will appear from the following statement of colonel walter h taylor assistant adjutantgeneral of the army our strength at chancellorsville anderson and mclaws 13000 jackson hill rodes and trimble # early fredericksburg 6000 40000 cavalry and artillery 7000 total of all arms # as the federal infantry numbered one hundred and twenty thousand according to the smallest estimate of federal authorities and lees infantry forty thousand the northern force was precisely three times as large as the southern general hooker had already proved himself an excellent administrative officer and his plan of campaign against lee seemed to show that he also possessed generalship of a high order he had determined to pass the rappahannock above fredericksburg turn lees flank and thus force him to deliver battle under this disadvantage or retire upon richmond the safe passage of the stream was the first great object and general hookers dispositions to effect this were highly judicious a force of about twenty thousand men was to pass the rappahannock at fredericksburg and thus produce upon lee the impression that the federal army was about to renew the attempt in which they had failed under general burnside while general lees attention was engaged by the force thus threatening his right the main body of the northern army was to cross the rappahannock and rapidan above chancellorsville and sweeping down rapidly upon the confederate left flank take up a strong position between chancellorsville and fredericksburg the column which had crossed at the latter point to engage the attention of the confederate commander was then to recross to the northern bank move rapidly to the upper fords which the advance of the main body would by that time have uncovered and a second time crossing to the southern bank unite with the rest thus the whole federal army would be concentrated on the southern bank of the rappahannock and general lee would be compelled to leave his camps on the hills of the massaponnax and fight upon ground dictated by his adversary if he did not thus accept battle but one other course was left he must fall back in the direction of richmond to prevent his adversary from attacking his rear and capturing or destroying his army in order to insure the success of this promising plan of attack a strong column of * cavalry was to cross in advance of the army and strike for the railroads in lees rear connecting him with richmond and the southwest thus flanked or cut off and with all his communications destroyed it seemed probable that general lee would suffer decisive defeat and that the federal army would march in triumph to the capture of the confederate capital this plan was certainly excellent and seemed sure to succeed it was however open to some criticism as the event showed general hooker was * in the beginning of the movement his whole cavalry force for a distant operation and dividing his army by the ruse at fredericksburg in face of an adversary not likely to permit that great error to escape him while advancing thus apparently to the certain destruction of lee general hooker was leaving a vulnerable point in his own armor lee would probably discover that point and aim to pierce his opponent there at most general hooker was wrapping in huge folds the sword of lee not remembering that there was danger to the cordon as well as to the weapon such was the plan which general hooker had devised to bring back that success of the federal arms in the spring of 1863 which had attended them in the early spring of 1862 at this latter period a heavy cloud rested upon the confederate cause * and roanoke island fort macon and the city of new orleans had then fallen at * kernstown newbern and other places the federal forces had achieved important successes these had been followed however by the southern victories on the chickahominy at manassas and at fredericksburg near this lastnamed spot now where the year had wound up with so mortifying a federal failure general hooker hoped to reverse events and recover the federal glories of the preceding spring operations began as early as the middle of march when general averill with about three thousand cavalry crossed the rappahannock at kellys ford above its junction with the rapidan and made a determined attack upon nearly eight hundred horsemen there under general fitz lee with the view of passing through culpepper crossing the rapidan and cutting lees communications in the direction of gordonsville the obstinate stand of general fitz lees small force however defeated this object and general averill was forced to retreat beyond the rappahannock again with considerable loss and abandon his expedition in this engagement fell major john pelham who had been styled in lees first report of the battle of fredericksburg the gallant pelham and whose brave stand on the port royal road had drawn from lee the exclamation it is glorious to see such courage in one so young pelham was in spite of his youth an * of the first order of excellence and his loss was a serious one in spite of his inferior rank after this action every thing remained quiet until toward the end of * lee continuing to hold the same position with his right at fredericksburg his left at the fords near chancellorsville and his cavalry under stuart guarding the banks of the rappahannock in culpepper on the 27th of april general hooker began his forward movement by advancing three corps of his * fifth eleventh and * the banks of the river near kellys ford and on the next day this force was joined by three additional corpsthe first third and * the whole on wednesday the 29th crossed the river without difficulty that this movement was a surprise to lee as has been supposed by some persons is a mistake stuart was an extremely vigilant * and both he and general lee were in the habit of sending accomplished scouts to watch any movements in the federal camps as soon as these * in a large army cannot be * place information was always promptly brought and it was not possible that general hooker could move three large army corps toward the rappahannock as he did on april 27th without early knowledge on the part of his adversary of so important a circumstance as the federal infantry thus advanced the large cavalry force began also to move through culpepper toward the central railroad in lees rear this column was commanded by general stoneman formerly a subordinate officer in lees old cavalry regiment in the united states army and as general stonemans operations were entirely separate from those of the infantry and not of much importance we shall here dismiss them in a few words he proceeded rapidly across culpepper harassed in his march by a small body of horse under general william hf lee reached the central railroad at * below gordonsville and tore up a portion of it passed on to james river * the country and attempted the destruction of the columbia * but did not succeed in so doing when hearing probably of the unforeseen result at chancellorsville he hastened back to the rapidan pursued and harassed as in his advance and crossing regained the federal lines beyond the rappahannock to return to the movements of the main federal force under the personal command of general hooker this advanced rapidly across the angle between the two rivers with no obstruction but that offered by the cavalry under stuart and on thursday april 30th had crossed the rapidan at germanna and elys fords and was steadily concentrating around chancellorsville at the same time the second corps under general couch was preparing to cross at united states ford a few miles distant and general sedgwick commanding the detached force at fredericksburg having crossed and threatened lee in obedience to orders now began passing back to the northern bank again in order to march up and join the main body thus all things seemed in train to succeed on the side of the federal army general hooker was over with about one hundred thousand * thousand additional troops would soon join him lees army seemed scattered and not in hand to oppose him and there was some ground for the * of joy attributed to general hooker as he saw his great force massing steadily in the vicinity of chancellorsville to those around him he exclaimed the rebel army is now the legitimate property of the army of the potomac they may as well pack up their haversacks and make for richmond and i shall be after them in a congratulatory order to his troops he declared that they occupied now a position so strong that the enemy must either ingloriously fly or come out from behind his defences and give us battle on our own ground where certain destruction awaits him such were the joyful anticipations of general hooker who seems to have regarded the campaign as virtually ended by the successful passage of the river his expressions and his general order would seem to indicate an irrepressible joy but it is doubtful if the skilful soldiers under him shared this somewhat juvenile enthusiasm the gray cavalier at fredericksburg was not reported to be retiring as was expected on the contrary the southern troops seemed to be moving forward with the design of accepting battle lee had determined promptly upon that course as soon as stuart sent him information of the enemys movements chancellorsville was at once seen to be the point for which general hooker was aiming and lees dispositions were made for confronting him there and fighting a pitched battle the brigades of posey and mahone of andersons division had been in front of bankss and elys fords and this force of about eight thousand men was promptly ordered to fall back on chancellorsville at the same time wrights brigade was sent up to renforce this column but the enemy continuing to advance in great force general anderson commanding the whole fell back from chancellorsville to tabernacle church on the road to fredericksburg where he was joined on the next day by jackson whom lee had sent forward to his assistance the ruse at fredericksburg had not long deceived the confederate commander general sedgwick with three corps in all about twentytwo thousand men had crossed just below fredericksburg on the 29th and lee had promptly directed general jackson to oppose him there line of battle was accordingly formed in the enemys front beyond hamiltons crossing but as neither on that day nor the next any further advance was made by general sedgwick the whole movement was seen to be a feint to cover the real operations above lee accordingly turned his attention in the direction of chancellorsville jackson as we have related was sent up to renforce general anderson and lee followed with the rest of the army with the exception of about six thousand men under general early whom he left to defend the crossing at fredericksburg such were the positions of the opposing forces on the 1st day of may each commander had displayed excellent generalship in the preliminary movements preceding the actual fighting at last however the opposing lines were facing each other and the real struggle was about to begin the wilderness as the region around chancellorsville is called is so strange a country and the character of the ground had so important a bearing upon the result of the great battle fought there that a brief description of the locality will be here presented the region is a nearly unbroken expanse of dense thicket pierced only by narrow and winding roads over which the traveller rides mile after mile without seeing a single human habitation it would seem indeed that the whole barren and melancholy tract had been given up to the owl the whippoorwill and the * its original tenants the plaintive cries of the nightbirds alone break the gloomy silence of the desolate region and the shadowy thicket stretching in every direction produces a depressing effect upon the feelings chancellorsville is in the centre of this singular territory on the main road or rather roads running from orange courthouse to fredericksburg from which latter place it is distant about ten miles in spite of its imposing name chancellorsville was simply a large * originally inhabited by a private family but afterward used as a roadside inn a little to the westward the old turnpike and orange plankroad unite as they approach the spot where they again divide to unite a second time a few miles to the east where they form the main highway to fredericksburg from the north come in roads from united states and elys fords germanna ford is northwest from the south runs the brock road in the direction of the rapidan passing a mile or two west of the place the whole country the roads the chance houses the silence the unending thicket in this dreary wilderness produce a sombre effect a writer familiar with it says there all is wild desolate and lugubrious thicket undergrowth and jungle stretch for miles impenetrable and untouched narrow roads wind on forever between melancholy masses of stunted and gnarled oak little sunlight shines there the face of nature is dreary and sad it was so before the battle it is not more cheerful today when as you ride along you see fragments of shell rotting knapsacks rusty gunbarrels bleached bones and grinning * into this jungle continues the same writer general hooker penetrated it was the wolf in his den ready to tear any one who approached a battle there seemed impossible neither side could see its antagonist artillery could not move cavalry could not operate the very infantry had to * their bodies to glide between the stunted trees that an army of one hundred and twenty thousand men should have chosen that spot to fight forty thousand and not only chosen it but made it a hundred times more impenetrable by * trees erecting breastworks disposing artillery en masse to sweep every road and bridlepath which led to * fact seemed incredible it was no part of the original plan of the federal commander to permit himself to be cooped up in this difficult and embarrassing region where it was impossible to manoeuvre his large army the selection of the wilderness around chancellorsville as the ground of battle was dictated by lee general hooker it seems endeavored to avoid being thus shut up in the thicket and hampered in his movements finding that the confederate force retiring from in front of elys and united states fords had on reaching chancellorsville continued to fall back in the direction of fredericksburg he followed them steadily passed through the wilderness and emerging into the open country beyond rapidly began forming line of battle on ground highly favorable to the manoeuvring of his large force in action a glance at the map will indicate the importance of this movement and the great advantages secured by it the left of general hookers line nearest the river was at least five miles in advance of chancellorsville and commanded bankss ford thereby shortening fully onehalf the distance of general sedgwicks march from fredericksburg by enabling him to use the ford in question as a place of crossing to the south bank and uniting his column with the main body the centre and right of the federal army had in like manner emerged from the thickets of the wilderness and occupied cleared ground sufficiently elevated to afford them great advantages this was in the forenoon of the 1st of may when there was no force in general hookers front except the eight thousand men of anderson at tabernacle church jackson had marched at midnight from the massaponnax hills with a general order from lee to attack and repulse the enemy but had not yet arrived there was thus no serious obstacle in the path of the federal commander who had it in his power it would seem to mass his entire army on the commanding ground which his vanguard already occupied lee was aware of the importance of the position and had he not been delayed by the feint of general sedgwick would himself have seized upon it as it was general hooker seemed to have won the prize in the race and lee would apparently be forced to assail him on his strong ground or retire in the direction of richmond the movements of the enemy had however been so rapid that lees dispositions seem to have been made before they were fully developed and accurately known to him he had sent forward jackson and now proceeded to follow in person leaving only a force of about six thousand men under early to defend the crossing at fredericksburg the promptness of these movements of the confederate commander is noticed by northern writers lee with instant perception of the situation says an able historian now seized the masses of his force and with the grasp of a titan swung them into position as a giant might fling a mighty stone from a sling such were the relative positions of the two armies on the 1st of may general hookers forces well in advance of chancellorsville and rapidly forming line of battle on a ridge in open country general lees stretching along the whole distance from fredericksburg to tabernacle church and certainly not in any condition to deliver or accept battle the federal commander seemed to have clearly outgeneralled his adversary and * speaking the movements of the two armies up to this time seemed to point to a decisive federal success general hookers own act reversed all this brilliant promise at the very moment when his army was steadily concentrating on the favorable ground in advance of chancellorsville the federal commander for some reason which has never been * sent a peremptory order that the entire force should fall back into the wilderness this order * every thing is said to have been received with mingled amazement and incredulity by his officers two of whom sent him word that from the great advantages of the position it should be held at all hazards general hookers reply was return at once the army accordingly fell back to chancellorsville this movement undoubtedly lost general hooker all the advantages which up to that moment he had secured what his motive for the order in question was it is impossible for the present writer to understand unless the approach of lee powerfully affected his imagination and he supposed the thicket around chancellorsville to be the best ground to receive that assault which the bold advance of his opponent appeared to foretell whatever his motive general hooker withdrew his lines from the open country fell back to the vicinity of chancellorsville and began to erect elaborate defences behind which to receive lees attack in this backward movement he was followed and harassed by the forces of jackson the command of anderson being in front jacksons maxim was to always press an enemy when he was retiring and no sooner had the federal forces begun to move than he made a prompt attack he continued to follow them up toward chancellorsville until nightfall when the fighting ceased the confederate advance having been pushed to * house within about two miles of chancellorsville here the outer line of the federal works was found and jackson paused he was unwilling at so late an hour to attempt an assault upon them with his small force and directing further movements to cease awaited the arrival of the commanderinchief lee arrived and a consultation was held the question now was the best manner with a force of about thirtyfive thousand to drive the federal army of about one hundred thousand beyond the rappahannock on this night of the 1st of may the situation of affairs was strange indeed general hooker had crossed the rappahannock with a force of one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and had without obstruction secured a position so strong he declared that lee must either ingloriously fly or fight a battle in which certain destruction awaited him so absolutely convinced indeed was the federal commander of the result of the coming encounter that he had * described the southern army as the legitimate property of the army of the potomac which in the event of the retreat of the confederates would be after them there seemed just grounds for this declaration whatever question may have arisen of the good taste displayed by general hooker in making it the force opposed to him was in all about fortyseven thousand men but as cavalry take small part in pitched battles lees fighting force was only about forty thousand to drive back forty thousand with one hundred and twenty thousand would not apparently prove difficult and it was no doubt this conviction which had occasioned the joyous exclamation of general hooker but his own act and the nerve of his adversary had defeated every thing instead of retreating with his small force upon richmond lee had advanced to accept or deliver battle this bold movement which general hooker does not seem to have anticipated paralyzed his energies he had not only crossed the two rivers without loss but had taken up a strong position where he could manoeuvre his army perfectly when in consequence of lees approach with the evident intent of fighting he had ceased to advance hesitated and ended by retiring this is a fair summary of events up to the night of the 1st of may general hooker had advanced boldly he was now falling back he had foretold that his adversary would ingloriously fly and that adversary was pressing him closely the army of the potomac he had declared would soon be after the army of northern virginia but from the appearance of things at the moment the army of northern virginia seemed after the army of the potomac we use general hookers own * are expressive if not dignified they are indeed suited to the subject which contains no little of the grotesque that anticipations and expressions so confident should have been met with a commentary of events so damaging was sufficient had the occasion not been so tragic to cause laughter in the gravest of human beings lees intent was now unmistakable instead of falling back from the rappahannock to some line of defence nearer richmond where the force under longstreet at suffolk might have rejoined him with other renforcements he had plainly resolved with the forty or fifty thousand men of his command to meet general hooker in open battle and leave the event to providence a design so bold would seem to indicate in lee a quality which at that time he was not thought to * willingness to risk decisive defeat by military movements depending for their success upon good fortune alone such seemed now the only deus ex * that could extricate the southern army from disaster and a crushing defeat at that time would have had terrible results there was no other force save the small body under longstreet and a few local troops to protect richmond had lee been disabled and afterward pressed by general hooker it is impossible to see that any thing but the fall of the confederate capital could have been the result from these speculations and comments we pass to the narrative of actual events general hooker had abandoned the strong position in advance of chancellorsville and retired to the fastnesses around that place to receive the southern attack his further proceedings indicated that he anticipated an assault from lee the federal troops had no sooner regained the thicket from which they had advanced in the morning than they were ordered to erect elaborate works for the protection of infantry and artillery this was promptly begun and by the next morning heavy defences had sprung up as if by magic trees had been felled and the trunks * so as to present a formidable obstacle to the southern attack in front of these works the forest had been levelled and the fallen trunks were left lying where they fell forming thus an abatis sufficient to seriously delay an assaulting force which would thus be at every step of the necessarily slow advance under fire on the roads piercing the thicket in the direction of the confederates cannon were posted to rake the approaches to the federal position having thus made his preparations to receive lees attack general hooker awaited that attack no doubt confident of his ability to repulse it his line resembled in some degree the two sides of an * * longer side extending east and west in front that is to say south of chancellorsville and the shorter side north and south nearly east of the place his right in the direction of wilderness tavern was comparatively undefended as it was not expected that lee would venture upon a movement against that remote point this line it would appear was formed with a view to the possible necessity of falling back toward the rappahannock a commander determined to risk everything would it seems have fronted lee boldly with a line running north and south east of chancellorsville general hookers main front was nearly east and west whatever may have been his object in so establishing it on the night of the 1st of may as we have said lee and jackson held a consultation to determine the best method of attacking the federal forces on the next day all the information which they had been able to obtain of the federal positions east and south of chancellorsville indicated that the defences in both these quarters were such as to render an assault injudicious jackson had found his advance obstructed by strong works near * house on the road running eastward from the enemys camps and general stuart and general wright who had moved to the left and advanced upon the enemys front near the point called the furnace had discovered the existence of powerful defences in that quarter also they had been met by a fierce and sudden artilleryfire from federal epaulements and here as to the east of chancellorsville the enemy had evidently fortified their position under these circumstances it was necessary to discover if possible some more favorable opening for an attack there remained but one * hookers right west of chancellorsville but to divide the army as would be necessary in order to attack in that quarter seemed an undertaking too hazardous to be thought of to execute such a plan of assault with any thing like a hope of success general lee would be compelled to detach considerably more than half of his entire force this would leave in general hookers front a body of troops too inconsiderable to make any resistance if he advanced his lines and thus the movement promised to result in the certain destruction of one portion of the army to be followed by a triumphant march of the federal forces upon richmond in the council of war between lee and jackson on the night of the 1st of may these considerations were duly weighed and the whole situation discussed in the end the hazardous movement against general hookers right beyond chancellorsville was determined upon this was first suggested it is said by * have attributed the suggestion to lee the point is not material the plan was adopted and lee determined to detach a column of about twentyone thousand men under jackson to make the attack on the next day his plan was to await the arrival of jackson at the point selected for attack meanwhile engaging the enemys attention by demonstrations in their front when jacksons guns gave the signal that he was engaged the force in front of the enemy was to advance and participate in the assault and thus struck in front and flank at once general hooker it was hoped would be defeated and driven back across the rappahannock there was another possible result the defeat of lee and jackson by general hooker but the desperate character of the situation rendered it necessary to disregard this risk by midnight this plan had been determined upon and at dawn jackson began to move on the morning of the 2d of may general lee was early in the saddle and rode to the front where he remained in personal command of the force facing the enemys main line of battle throughout the day this force consisted of the divisions of anderson and mclaws and amounted to thirteen thousand men that left at fredericksburg as we have said under general early numbered six thousand men and the twentyone thousand which jackson had taken with him to strike at the enemys right made up the full body of troops under lee that is to say a little over forty thousand artillerymen included the cavalry numbering four or five thousand were like the absent federal cavalry not actually engaged in accordance with the plan agreed upon between lee and jackson the force left in the enemys front proceeded to engage their attention and desultory fighting continued throughout the day general lee meanwhile awaited the sound of jacksons guns west of chancellorsville and must have experienced great anxiety at this trying moment although with his accustomed selfcontrol he displayed little or none we shall now leave this comparatively interesting portion of the field and invite the attention of the reader to the movements of general jackson who was about to strike his last great blow and lose his own life in the moment of victory jackson set out at early dawn having under him three divisions commanded by rhodes and trimble in all about twentyone thousand men and directed his march over the old mine road toward the furnace about a mile or so from and in front of the enemys main line stuart moved with his cavalry on the flank of the column with the view of * it from observation and it reached and passed the furnace where a regiment with artillery was left to guard the road leading thence to chancellorsville and repel any attack which might be made upon the rear of the column just as the rearguard passed on the anticipated attack took place and the regiment thus left the twentythird georgia was suddenly surrounded and the whole force captured the confederate artillery however opened promptly upon the assailing force drove it back toward chancellorsville and jackson proceeded on his march without further interruption he had thus been seen but it seems that the whole movement was regarded by general hooker as a retreat of the confederates southward a bend in the road at this point toward the south leading to that supposition we know the enemy is flying general hooker wrote on the afternoon of this day to general sedgwick trying to save his trains two of sickless divisions are among them soon after leaving the furnace however jackson following the same * turned westward and marching rapidly between the walls of thicket struck into the brock road which runs in a direction nearly northwest toward germanna and elys fords this would enable him to reach without discovery the orange plankroad or old turnpike west of chancellorsville as the woods through which the narrow highway ran completely barred him from observation unless federal spies were lurking in the covert or their * of cavalry came in sight of the column it would move as secure from discovery as though it were a hundred miles distant from the enemy and against the latter danger of * stuarts presence with his horsemen provided the movement was thus made without alarming the enemy and the head of jacksons column reached the orange plankroad near which point general fitz lee invited jackson to ride up to a slight elevation from which the defences of the enemy were visible jackson did so and a glance showed him that he was not yet sufficiently upon the enemys flank he accordingly turned to an aide and said pointing to the orange plankroad tell my column to cross that road the column did so continuing to advance toward the rapidan until it reached the old turnpike running from the old wilderness tavern toward chancellorsville at this point jackson found himself full on the right flank of general hooker and halting his troops proceeded promptly to form line of battle for the attack it was now past four in the afternoon and the declining sun warned the confederates to lose no time the character of the ground was however such as to dismay any but the most resolute and it seemed impossible to execute the intended movement with any thing like rapidity in such a jungle on both sides of the old turnpike rose a wall of thicket through which it was impossible to move a regular line of battle all the rules of war must be reversed in face of this obstacle and the assault on general hookers works seemed destined to be made in column of infantry companies and with the artillery moving in column of pieces despite these serious obstacles jackson hastened to form such order of battle as was possible and with rodess division in front followed by colston trimble and hill advanced steadily down the old turnpike toward chancellorsville he had determined not only to strike the enemys right flank but to execute if possible a still more important movement this was to extend his lines steadily to the left swing round his left wing and so interpose himself between general hooker and the rapidan this design of unsurpassed boldness continued to burn in jacksons brain until he fell and almost his last words were an allusion to it the federal line of works which the confederates thus advanced to assault extended across the old turnpike near the house of * chancellor and behind was a second line which was covered by the federal artillery in the earthworks near chancellorsville the eleventh corps under general howard was that destined to receive jacksons assault this was made at a few minutes past five in the evening and proved decisive the federal troops were surprised at their suppers and were wholly unprepared they had scarcely time to run to their muskets which were stacked near at hand when rodes burst upon them stormed their works over which the troops marched almost * and in a few minutes the entire corps holding the federal right was in hopeless disorder rodes pressed on followed by the division in his rear and the affair became rather a hunt than a battle the confederates pursued with yells killing or capturing all with whom they could come up the federal artillery rushed off at a gallop striking against * and * and the army of general hooker seemed about to be hopelessly routed this is the account given by northern writers who represent the effect of jacksons sudden attack as indescribable it had a serious effect as will be subsequently shown on the morale both of general hooker and his army while opposing the heavy demonstrations of general lees forces on their left and in front this storm had burst upon them from a quarter in which no one expected it they were thus caught between two fires and ignorant as they were of the small number of the confederates must have regarded the army as seriously * jackson continued to pursue the enemy on the road to chancellorsville intent now upon making his blow decisive by swinging round his left and cutting off the federal army from the rappahannock it was impossible however to execute so important a movement until his troops were well in hand and the two divisions which had made the attack had become mixed up in a very confused manner they were accordingly directed to halt and general ap hill whose division had not been engaged was sent for and ordered to advance to the front thus affording the disordered divisions an opportunity to reform their broken lines soon after * this order jackson rode out in front of his line on the chancellorsville road in order to reconnoitre in person and ascertain if possible the position and movements of the enemy then within a few hundred yards of him it was now between nine and ten oclock at night the fighting had temporarily ceased and the moon * through misty clouds lit up the dreary thickets in which no sound was heard but the incessant and melancholy cries of the * jackson had ridden forward about a hundred yards in advance of his line on the turnpike accompanied by a few officers and had checked his horse to listen for any sound coming from the direction of chancellorsville when suddenly a volley was fired by his own infantry on the right of the road apparently directed at him and his companions under the impression that they were a federal * several of the party fell from their horses and wheeling to the left jackson galloped into the wood to escape a renewal of the fire the result was melancholy he passed directly in front of his men who had been warned to guard against an attack of cavalry in their excited state so near the enemy and surrounded by darkness jackson was supposed to be a federal cavalryman the men accordingly fired upon him at not more than twenty paces and wounded him in three * in the left arm and once in the right hand at the instant when he was struck he was holding his bridle with his left hand and had his right hand raised either to protect his face from boughs or in the strange gesture habitual to him in battle as the bullets passed through his arm he dropped the bridle of his horse from his left hand but seized it again with the bleeding fingers of his right hand when the animal wheeling suddenly darted toward chancellorsville in doing so he passed beneath the limb of a * which struck the wounded man in the face tore off his cap and threw him back on his horse nearly dismounting him he succeeded however in retaining his seat and regained the road where he was received in the arms of captain wilbourn one of his staffofficers and laid at the foot of a tree the fire had suddenly ceased and all was again still only captain wilbourn and a courier were with jackson but a shadowy figure on horseback was seen in the edge of the wood near silent and motionless when captain wilbourn called to this person and directed him to ride back and see what troops had thus fired upon them the silent figure disappeared and did not return who this could have been was long a mystery but it appears from a recent statement of general revere of the federal army that it was himself he had advanced to the front to reconnoitre had come on the group at the foot of the tree and receiving the order above mentioned had thought it prudent not to reveal his real character he accordingly rode into the wood and regained his own lines a few words will terminate our account of this melancholy event in the history of the * fall of jackson he was supported to the rear by his officers and during this painful progress gave his last order general pender recognized him and stated that he feared he could not hold his position jacksons eye flashed and he replied with animation you must hold your ground general pender you must hold your ground sir he was now so weak as to be unable to walk even leaning on the shoulders of his officers he was accordingly placed on a litter and borne toward the rear before the litter had gone far a furious artilleryfire swept the road from the direction of chancellorsville and the bearers lowered it to the earth and lay down beside it the fire * they again moved but one of the bearers stumbled over a root and let the litter fall jackson groaned and as the moonlight fell upon his face it was seen to be so pale that he appeared to be about to die when asked if he was much hurt he opened his eyes however and said no my friend dont trouble yourself about me he was then borne to the rear placed in an ambulance and carried to the hospital at the old wilderness tavern where he remained until he was taken to * station where he died such was the fate of lees great * man whom he spoke of as his right * death struck a chill to the hearts of the southern people from which they never recovered general lee was not informed of the misfortune which had befallen his great lieutenant until toward daybreak on the next morning this fact was doubtless attributable to the difficult character of the country the interposition of the federal army between the two confederate wings which rendered a long dtour necessary in reaching lee and the general confusion and dismay attending jacksons fall it would be difficult indeed to form an exaggerated estimate of the condition of jacksons corps at this time the troops had been thrown into what seemed inextricable disorder in consequence of the darkness and the headlong advance of the second * division upon the heels of rhodes which had resulted in a complete * of the two commands and to make matters worse general ap hill the second in command had been wounded and disabled nearly at the same moment with jackson by the artilleryfire of the enemy this transferred the command of military right to the brave and skilful general rhodes the ranking officer after hill but rhodes was only a brigadiergeneral and had for that reason never come into personal contact with the whole corps who knew little of him and was not aware of jacksons plans and * under these circumstances his ability to conduct to a successful issue so vitally important an operation as that intrusted to this great wing of the southern army stuart who had gone with his cavalry toward elys ford to make a demonstration on the federal rear was therefore sent for and rode as rapidly as possible to the scene of action and the command was formally relinquished to him by general rhodes jackson sent stuart word from wilderness tavern to act upon his own judgment and do what he thought best as he had implicit confidence in him but in consequence of the darkness and confusion it was impossible for stuart to promptly reform the lines and thus all things remained entangled and confused it was essential however to inform general lee of the state of affairs and jacksons * colonel pendleton requested captain wilbourn who had witnessed all the details of the painful scene in the wood to go to general lee and acquaint him with what had taken place and receive his orders from a ms statement of this meritorious officer we take these brief details of the interview lee was found lying asleep in a little clump of pines near his front covered with an * to protect him from the dews of the night and surrounded by the officers of his staff also asleep it was not yet daybreak and the darkness prevented the messenger from distinguishing the commanderinchief from the rest he accordingly called for major taylor lees adjutantgeneral and that officer promptly awoke when he was informed of what had taken place as the conversation continued the sound awoke general lee who asked who is there major taylor informed him and rising upon his elbow lee pointed to his blankets and said sit down here by me captain and tell me all about the fight last evening he listened without comment during the recital but when it was finished said with great feeling ah captain any victory is dearly bought which * us of the services of general jackson even for a short time from this reply it was evident that he did not regard the wounds received by jackson as of a serious * was natural from the fact that they were only * in the arm and * believed that the only result would be a temporary absence of his lieutenant from command as captain wilbourn continued to speak of the incident lee added with greater emotion than at first ah dont talk about it thank god it is no worse he then remained silent but seeing captain wilbourn rise as if to go he requested him to remain as he wished to talk with him some more and proceeded to ask a number of questions in reference to the position of the troops who was in command etc when informed that rhodes was in temporary command but that stuart had been sent for he exclaimed rhodes is a gallant courageous and energetic officer and asked where jackson and stuart could be found calling for paper and pencil to write to them captain wilbourn added that from what he had heard jackson say he thought he intended to get possession if possible of the road to united states ford in the federal rear and so cut them off from the river that night or early in the morning at these words lee rose quickly and said with animation these people must be pressed today it would seem that at this moment a * captain * jacksons skilful * from wilderness tavern bringing a note from the wounded general lee read it with much feeling and dictated the following reply this was dispatched with a second note to stuart directing him to assume command and press the enemy at dawn lee then mounted his horse and just as the day began to break formed line of battle opposite the enemys front his line extending on the right to the plankroad running from chancellorsville in the direction of fredericksburg this force under the personal command of lee amounted as we have said originally to about thirteen thousand men and as their loss had not been very severe in the demonstrations made against the enemy on the preceding days they were in good condition the obvious course now was to place the troops in a position which would enable them in the event of stuarts success in driving the federal right to unite the left of lees line with the right of stuart and so press the federal army back on chancellorsville and the river we shall now return to the left wing of the army which in spite of the absence of the commanding general was the column of attack which was looked to for the most important results in response to the summons of the preceding night stuart had come back from the direction of elys ford at a swift gallop burning with ardor at the thought of leading jacksons great corps into battle the military ambition of this distinguished commander of lees horse was great and he had often chafed at the jests directed at the cavalry arm and at himself as only a * he had now presented to him an opportunity of showing that he was a trained soldier competent by his nerve and military ability to lead any arm of the service and greeted the occasion with delight the men of jackson had been accustomed to see that commander pass slowly along their lines on a horse as * as himself a * figure with little of the poetry of war in his appearance they now found themselves commanded by a youthful and daring cavalier on a spirited animal with floating plume silken sash and a sabre which gleamed in the moonlight as its owner galloped to and fro cheering the men and * them for the coming assault as he led the lines afterward with joyous vivacity his sabre drawn his plume floating proudly one of the men compared him to henry of * at the battle of * but stuarts spirit of wild gayety destroyed the romantic dignity of the scene he led the men of jackson against general hookers breastworks bristling with cannon singing old joe hooker will you come out of the wilderness this sketch will convey a correct idea of the officer who had now grasped the * falling from the hand of the great marshal of lee it was probable that the advance of the infantry under such a commander would partake of the rush and rapidity of a * and the sequel justified this view at early dawn the southern lines began to move either in consequence of orders from lee or following his own conception stuart reversed the movement of jackson who had aimed to swing round his left and cut off the enemy he seemed to have determined to extend his right with the view of uniting with the left of andersons division under lee and enclosing the enemy in the angle near chancellorsville lee had moved at the same moment on their front advancing steadily over all obstacles and a northern writer who witnessed the combined attack speaks of it in enthusiastic terms from the large brick house which gives the name to this vicinity says the writer speaking of chancellorsville the enemy could be seen sweeping slowly but confidently * and surely through the * which extended in front nothing could excite more admiration for the qualities of the veteran soldiers than the manner in which the enemy swept out as they moved steadily onward the forces which were opposed to them we say it reluctantly and for the first time that the enemy have shown the finest qualities and we acknowledge on this occasion their superiority in the open field to our own men they delivered their fire with precision and were apparently inflexible and immovable under the storm of bullets and shell which they were constantly receiving coming to a piece of timber which was occupied by a division of our own men half the number were detailed to clear the woods it seemed certain that here they would be repulsed but they marched right through the wood driving our own soldiers out who delivered their fire and fell back halted again fired and fell back as before seeming to concede to the enemy as a matter of course the superiority which they evidently felt themselves our own men fought well there was no lack of courage but an evident feeling that they were destined to be beaten and the only thing for them to do was to fire and retreat this description of the steady advance of the southern line applies rather to the first portion of the attack which compelled the front line of the federal army to retire to the stronger ground in rear when this was reached and the troops of lee saw before them the last citadel the steady advance became a rush the divisions of anderson and mclaws on the right made a determined charge upon the great force under generals hancock slocum and others in that quarter and stuart closed in on the federal right steadily extending his line to join on to anderson the spectacle here was superb as the troops rushed on stuart shouted charge and remember jackson and this * seemed to drive the line forward with stuart leading them and singing in his joyous voice old joe hooker will you come out of the * courage poetry and seeming frivolity were strangely mingled in this great * troops went headlong at the federal works and in a few moments the real struggle of the battle of chancellorsville had begun from this instant when the lines respectively commanded in person by lee and by stuart closed in with the enemy there was little manoeuvring of any description it was an open attempt of lee by hard fighting to crush in the enemys front and force them back upon the river in this arduous struggle it is due to stuart to say that his generalship largely decided the event and the high commendation which he afterward received from general lee justifies the statement as his lines went to the attack his quick military eye discerned an elevated point on his right from which it appeared an artilleryfire * * the federal line about thirty pieces of cannon were at once hastened to this point and a destructive fire opened on the lines of general slocum which threw his troops into great confusion so serious was this fire that general slocum sent word to general hooker that his front was being swept away by it to which the sullen response was i cannot make soldiers or ammunition general hooker was indeed it seems at this moment in no mood to take a hopeful view of affairs the heavy assault of jackson appears to have as much demoralized the federal commander as his troops during the night he had erected a semicircular line of works in the form of a * in his rear toward the river behind which new works he no doubt contemplated falling back he now awaited the result of the southern attack leaning against a pillar of the porch at the chancellorsville house when a cannonball struck the pillar throwing it down and so stunning the general as to prevent him from retaining the command which was delegated to general couch the fate of the day had now been decided the right wing of the southern army under lee had gradually extended its left to meet the extension of stuarts right and this junction of the two wings having been effected lee took personal command of all and advanced his whole front in a decisive assault before this the federal front gave way and the disordered troops were huddled * only a confused and disorganized * chancellorsville the southern troops pursued with yells leaping over the earthworks and driving all before them a scene of singular horror ensued the chancellorsville house which had been set on fire by shell was seen to spout flame from every window and the adjoining woods had in like manner caught fire and were heard roaring over the dead and wounded of both sides alike the thicket had become the scene of the * of all agonies for the unfortunates unable to extricate themselves the whole spectacle in the vicinity of the chancellorsville house now in lees possession was frightful fire smoke blood confused yells and dying groans mingled to form the dark picture lee had ridden to the front of his line following up the enemy and as he passed before the troops they greeted him with one prolonged unbroken cheer in which those wounded and lying upon the ground united in that cheer spoke the fierce joy of men whom the hard combat had turned into bloodhounds arousing all the ferocious instincts of the human soul lee sat on his horse motionless near the chancellorsville house his face and figure lit up by the glare of the burning woods and gave his first attention even at this exciting moment to the unfortunates of both sides wounded and in danger of being burned to death while issuing his orders on this subject a note was brought to him from jackson congratulating him upon his victory after reading it with evidences of much emotion he turned to the officer who had brought it and said say to general jackson that the victory is his and that the congratulation is due to him the federal army had fallen back in disorder by this time toward their second line it was about ten oclock in the morning and chancellorsville was in lees possession lee hastened to bring the southern troops into order again and succeeded in promptly reforming his line of battle his front extending unbroken along the old turnpike facing the river his design was to press general hooker and reap those rich rewards of victory to which the hard fighting of the men had entitled them of the demoralized condition of the federal forces there can be no doubt and the obvious course now was to follow up their retreat and endeavor to drive them in disorder beyond the rappahannock the order to advance upon the enemy was about to be given when a messenger from fredericksburg arrived at full gallop and communicated intelligence which arrested the order just as it was on lees lips a considerable force of the enemy was advancing up the turnpike from fredericksburg to fall upon his right flank and upon his rear in case he moved beyond chancellorsville the column was that of general sedgwick this officer it will be remembered had been detached to make a heavy demonstration at fredericksburg and was still at that point with his troops drawn up on the southern bank three miles below the city on saturday night while jackson was fighting on that morning general hooker had sent for reynoldss corps but even in the absence of this force general sedgwick retained under him about twentytwo thousand men and this column was now ordered to storm the heights at fredericksburg march up the turnpike and attack lee in flank general sedgwick received the order at eleven oclock on saturday night about the time when jackson was carried wounded to the rear he immediately made his preparations to obey and at daylight moved up from below the city to storm the ridge at maryes and march straight upon chancellorsville in the first assaults he failed suffering considerable loss from the fire of the southern troops under general barksdale commanding the line at that point but subsequently forming an assaulting column for a straight rush at the hill he went forward with impetuosity drove the southern advanced line from behind the stone wall which generals sumner and hooker had failed in reaching and about eleven in the morning stormed maryes hill and killed captured or dispersed the entire southern force there the confederates fought hand to hand over their guns with the enemy for the possession of the crest but their numbers were inadequate the entire surviving force fell back over the telegraph road southward and general sedgwick promptly advanced up the turnpike leading from fredericksburg to chancellorsville to assail general lee it was the intelligence of this threatening movement which now reached lee and induced him to defer further attack at the moment upon general hooker he determined promptly to send a force against general sedgwick and this resolution seems to have been based upon sound military judgment there was little to be feared now from general hooker large as the force still was under that officer he was paralyzed for the time and would not probably venture upon any attempt to regain possession of chancellorsville with general sedgwick it was different his column was comparatively fresh was flushed with victory and numbered even after his loss of one thousand more than twenty thousand men compared with the entire federal army this force was merely a detachment it was true but it was a detachment numbering as many men probably as the effective of lees entire army at chancellorsville he had carried into that fight about thirtyfour thousand men his losses had been heavy and the commands were much shaken to have advanced under these circumstances upon general hooker without regard to general sedgwicks twenty thousand troops inspired by recent victory would have resulted probably in disaster these comments may detract from that praise of audacity accorded to lee in making this movement it seems rather to have been the dictate of * to have advanced upon general hooker would have been the audacity it was thus necessary to defer the final blow at the main federal army in his front and general lee promptly detached a force of about five brigades to meet general sedgwick which with earlys command now in rear of the federal column would it was supposed suffice this body moved speedily down the turnpike to check the enemy and encountered the head of his column about halfway near salem church general wilcox who had been sent by lee to watch bankss ford had already moved to bar the federal advance when the brigades sent by lee joined him the whole force formed line of battle a brisk action ensued continuing from about four in the afternoon until nightfall when the fighting ceased and general sedgwick made no further attempt to advance on that day these events took place as we have said on sunday afternoon the day of the federal defeat at chancellorsville on monday morning may 4th the theatre of action on the southern bank of the rappahannock presented a very remarkable * general early had been driven from the ridge at fredericksburg but no sooner had general sedgwick marched toward chancellorsville than early returned and seized upon maryes heights again he was thus in general sedgwicks rear and ready to prevent him from recrossing the rappahannock at fredericksburg sedgwick meanwhile was moving to assail lees flank and rear and lee was ready to attack general hooker in front such was the singular * of the northern and southern forces on monday morning after the battle of chancellorsville what the result was to be the hours of that day were now to decide lee resolved first if possible to crush general sedgwick when it was his design to return and make a decisive assault upon general hooker in accordance with this plan he on monday morning went in personal command of three brigades of andersons division reached the vicinity of salem church and proceeded to form line of battle with the whole force there owing to unforeseen delays the attack was not begun until late in the afternoon when the whole line advanced upon general sedgwick lees aim being to cut him off from the river in this he failed the stubborn resistance of the federal forces enabling them to hold their ground until night at that time however they seemed to waver and lose heart whether from receiving intelligence of general hookers mishap or from other causes is not known they were now pressed by the southern troops and finally gave way general sedgwick retreated rapidly but in good order to bankss ford where a pontoon had been fortunately laid and this enabled him to cross his men the passage was effected under cover of darkness the southern cannon firing upon the retreating column and with this ended the movement of general sedgwick on tuesday morning lee returned with his men toward chancellorsville and during the whole day was busily engaged in preparation for a decisive attack upon general hooker on the next morning when however the southern sharpshooters felt their way at daylight toward the federal position it was found that the works were entirely deserted general hooker had recrossed the river spreading * on the pontoon bridge to * the sound of his * so the great advance ended the movements of the two armies in the chancellorsville campaign as it is generally styled have been so fully described in the foregoing pages that little comment upon them is here necessary the main feature which * attention in surveying the whole series of operations is the boldness amounting to apparent recklessness of lee and first the excellent generalship and then the extraordinary tissue of military errors of general hooker up to the 1st of may when he emerged from the chancellorsville thicket every thing had succeeded with the federal commander and deserved to succeed he had successfully brought over his great force which he himself described as the finest army on the planet and occupied strong ground east of chancellorsville on the road to fredericksburg general sedgwick was absent at the latter place with a strong detachment of the army but the main body covered bankss ford but twelve miles from the city and by the afternoon of this day the whole army might have been concentrated then the fate of lee would seem to have been decided he had not only a very small army but that army was scattered and liable to be cut off in detail general sedgwick menaced his right at * hooker was in front of his left near * to crush one of these wings before the other could come to its assistance seemed a work of no very great difficulty general hooker appears however to have * his ability to effect this result and finding that general lee was advancing with his main body to attack him retired from his strong position in the open country to the dense thicket around chancellorsville that this was a grave military error there can be no doubt as by this retrograde movement general hooker not only discouraged his troops who had been elated by his confident and inspiring general orders but lost the great advantage of the open country where his large force could be successfully manoeuvred lee took instant advantage of this fault in his adversary and boldly pressed the force retiring into the wilderness where on the night of the 1st of may general hooker was shut up with his army this unforeseen result presented the adversaries now in an entirely new light the federal army which had been promised by its commander a speedy march upon richmond in pursuit of lee had instead of advancing made a backward movement and lee who it had been supposed would retreat was now following and offering them battle the daring resolution of lee to divide his army and attack the federal right followed it would seem unjust to general hooker greatly to blame him for the success of that blow which could not have been reasonably anticipated in determining upon this one of the most extraordinary movements of the war general lee proceeded in defiance of military rules and was only justified in his course by the desperate character of the situation of affairs it was impossible to make any impression upon general hookers front or left owing to the elaborate defences in both quarters it was therefore necessary either to retire or attack in a different direction as a retreat however upon richmond would have surrendered to the enemy a large and fertile tract of country it was desirable if possible to avoid that alternative and the attack on the federal right followed the results of this were truly extraordinary the force routed and driven back in disorder by general jackson was but a single corps and that corps it is said not a legitimate part of the old army of the potomac but the disorder seems to have communicated itself to the whole army and to have especially discouraged general hooker in describing the scene in question we refrained from dwelling upon the full extent of the confusion into which the federal forces were thrown some sentences taken from northern accounts may lead to a better understanding of the result after jacksons assault a northern historian says the open plain around chancellorsville presented such a spectacle as a * sweeping over the desert might make through the dusk of nightfall a rushing whirlwind of men and artillery and wagons swept down the road past headquarters and on toward the fords of the rappahannock and it was in vain that the staff opposed their persons and drawn sabres to the panicstricken fugitives another writer an eyewitness says the spectacle presented was that of solid columns of infantry retreating at doublequick a dense mass of beings flying hundreds of * left riderless at the first discharge from the rebels dashing frantically about in all directions scores of batteries flying from the field * ambulances horses men cannon caissons all * and tumbled together in one inextricable * stampede universal the disgrace general after all however it was but one corps of the federal army which had been thus thrown into disorder and general hooker had no valid grounds for * his ability to defeat lee in a more decisive action there are many reasons for coming to the conclusion that he did from that moment distrust his powers he had courageously hastened to the assailed point ordering the men to throw themselves into the breach and receive jacksons troops on the bayonet but after this display of soldierly resolution general hooker appears to have lost some of that nerve which should never desert a soldier and on the same night sent engineers to trace out a new line of defences in his rear to which it seems he already contemplated the probability of being forced to retire why he came to take this depressed view of the situation of affairs it is difficult to say one of general sedgwicks corps reached him on this night and his force at chancellorsville still amounted to between ninety and one hundred thousand men about thrice that of lee no decisive trial of strength had yet taken place between the two armies and yet the larger force was constructing defences in rear to protect them from the * circumstance not tending it would seem to greatly encourage the troops whose commander was thus providing for a safe retreat the subsequent order to general sedgwick to march up from fredericksburg and assail lees right was judicious and really saved the army from a great disaster lee was about to follow up the discouraged forces of general hooker as they fell back toward the river and as the southern army was flushed with victory the surrender of the great body might have ensued this possible result was prevented by the flank movement of general sedgwick and some gratitude for assistance so important from his able lieutenant would have seemed natural and graceful in general hooker this view of the subject does not seem however to have been taken by the federal commander he subsequently charged the defeat of chancellorsville upon general sedgwick who he declared had failed in a prompt compliance with his orders the facts do not bear out this charge as the reader has seen general sedgwick received the order toward midnight on saturday and at eleven oclock on sunday morning had passed over that stubborn stone wall which in the battle of the preceding december general hookers column had not even been able to reach had stormed maryes hill which general hooker had described in vindication of his own failure to carry the position as * a fortification and a mountain of rock and had marched thereafter so promptly as to force lee in his own defence to arrest the second advance upon the federal main body and divert a considerable force to meet the attack on his flank after the repulse of general sedgwick and his retreat across the rappahannock general hooker seems to have been completely discouraged and hastened to put the river between himself and lee his losses in the battles of saturday and sunday had amounted to seventeen thousand one hundred and * killed and wounded and missing fourteen pieces of artillery and twenty thousand stand of arms the confederate loss was ten thousand two hundred and * contrary to the ordinary course of things the assailing force had lost a less number of men than that assailed the foregoing reflections which necessarily involve a criticism of general hooker arise naturally from a review of the events of the campaign and seem justified by the circumstances there can be no inducement for the present writer to * the military ability of the federal commander as that want of ability rather * from than adds to the merit of general lee in defeating him it may be said indeed that without these errors and shortcomings of general hooker lee * speaking must have been either defeated or forced to retire upon richmond after giving full weight however to all the advantages derived from the extraordinary federal * and mistakes general lees merit in this campaign was greater perhaps than in any other during his entire career had he left behind him no other record than this it alone would have been sufficient to have conferred upon him the first glories of arms and handed his name down to posterity as that of one of the greatest soldiers of history it is difficult to discover a single error committed by him in the whole series of movements from the moment when general sedgwick crossed at fredericksburg to the time of general hookers retreat beyond the rappahannock it may appear that there was unnecessary delay in permitting tuesday to pass without a final advance upon general hooker in his second line of intrenchments but no doubt many circumstances induced lee to defer this * fatigue of his troops consequent upon the fighting of the four preceding days friday saturday sunday and monday the necessity of reforming his battalions for the final blow and the anticipation that general hooker who still had at his command a force of more than one hundred thousand men would not so promptly relinquish his campaign and retire with the exception of this error if it be such lee had made no single false step in the whole of his movements the campaign was round perfect and * as a student of the art of war might pore over and analyze as an instance of the greatest principles of military science clothed in act the most striking features of lees movements were their rapidity and audacity it had been the fashion with some persons to speak of lee as slow and cautious in his operations and this criticism had not been completely silenced even in the winter of 1862 when his failure to crush general burnside afforded his detractors another opportunity of repeating the old charge after the chancellorsville campaign these * were * one could be found to listen to them the whole southern movement completely contradicted their theory at the first intelligence of the advance of general hookers main body across the upper rappahannock lee rode rapidly in that direction and ordered his troops at the fords of the river to fall back to chancellorsville he then returned and finding that general sedgwick had crossed at fredericksburg held a prompt consultation with jackson when it was decided at once to concentrate the main body of the army in front of general hookers column at the word jackson moved lee followed on the 1st of may the enemy were pressed back upon chancellorsville on the 2d his right was crushed and his army thrown into confusion on the 3d he was driven from chancellorsville and but for the flank movement of general sedgwick which lee was not in sufficient force to prevent general hooker would upon that same day sunday have in all probability suffered a decisive defeat in the course of four days lee had thus advanced and checked and then attacked and repulsed with heavy slaughter an army thrice as large as his own on the last day of april he had been nearly enveloped by a host of about one hundred and twenty thousand men on the 3d day of may their main body was in disorderly retreat and at daylight on the morning of the 6th there was not a federal soldier with the exception of the prisoners taken on the southern bank of the rappahannock during all these critical scenes when the fate of the confederate capital and possibly of the southern cause hung suspended in the balance general lee preserved as thousands of persons can testify the most admirable serenity and composure without that jubilant confidence displayed by general hooker in his address to the troops and the exclamations to his officers lee was equally free from gloom or any species of depression his spirits seemed to rise under the pressure upon him and at times he was almost gay when one of general jacksons aides hastened into his tent near fredericksburg and with great animation informed him that the enemy were crossing the river in heavy force in his front he seemed to be amused by that circumstance and said smiling well i heard firing and i was beginning to think it was time some of you lazy young fellows were coming to tell me what it was all about say to general jackson that he knows just as well what to do with the enemy as i do the commanderinchief who could find time at such a moment to indulge in * must have possessed excellent nerve and this composure mingled with a certain buoyant hopefulness as of one sure of the event remained with lee throughout the whole great wrestle with general hooker he retained to the end his simple and quiet manner divested of every thing like excitement in the consultation with jackson on the night of the 1st of may when the crisis was so critical his demeanor indicated no anxiety and when as we have said the news came of jacksons wound he said simply sit down here by me captain and tell me all about the fight last * ah captain any victory is dearly bought which * us of the services of general jackson even for a short time dont talk about * god it is no worse the turns of expression here are those of a person who permits nothing to disturb his serenity and indulges his * and tenderer feelings even in the hot atmosphere of a great conflict the picture presented is surely an interesting and beautiful one the human being who uttered the goodnatured criticism at the expense of the lazy young fellows and who greeted the news of jacksons misfortune with a sigh as tender as that of a woman was the soldier who had seized the masses of his force with the grasp of a titan and swung them into position as a giant might fling a mighty stone to general hookers threat to crush him he had responded by crushing general hooker nearly surrounded by the huge cordon of the federal army he had cut the cordon and emerged in safety general hooker with his one hundred thousand men had retreated to the north bank of the rappahannock and on the south bank lee with his thirty thousand remained erect threatening and triumphant we have not presented in these pages the orders of lee on various occasions as these papers are for the most part of an official character and not of great interest to the general reader we shall however occasionally present these documents and here lay before the reader the orders of both general hooker and general lee after the battle of chancellorsville giving precedence to the former the order of the federal commander was as follows the most important incident of the great battle of chancellorsville was the fall of jackson the services of this illustrious soldier had now become almost indispensable to general lee who spoke of him as his right arm and the commanderinchief had so long been accustomed to lean upon the strong shoulder of his lieutenant that now when this support was withdrawn he seems to have felt the loss of it profoundly in the war indeed there had arisen no soldier who so powerfully drew the public eye as jackson in the opinion of many persons he was a greater and abler commander than lee himself and although such an opinion will not be found to stand after a full review of the characters and careers of the two leaders there was sufficient ground for it to induce many fair and intelligent persons to adopt it jackson had been almost uniformly successful he had conducted to a triumphant issue the arduous campaign of the valley where he was opposed in nearly every battle by a force much larger than his own and these victories in a quarter so important and at a moment so critical had come borne on the wind of the mountain to * and inspire the hearts of the people of richmond and the entire confederacy jacksons rapid march and assault on general mcclellans right on the chickahominy had followed he then advanced northward defeated the vanguard of the enemy at cedar mountain led the great column of lee against the rear of general pope destroyed manassas held his ground until lee arrived and bore an important part in the battle which ensued thence he had passed to maryland fallen upon harpers ferry and captured it returned to fight with lee at sharpsburg and in that battle had borne the brunt of the enemys main assault with an unbroken front that the result was a drawn battle and not a southern defeat was due to lees generalship and jacksons fighting the retrograde movement to the lowland followed and jackson was left in the valley to embarrass mcclellans advance in this he perfectly succeeded and then suddenly reappeared at fredericksburg where he received and repulsed one of the two great assaults of the enemy the battle of chancellorsville followed and lees statement of the part borne in this hard combat by jackson has been given the result was due he said not to his own generalship but to the skill and energy of his lieutenant whose congratulations he refused to receive declaring that the victory was jacksons here had at last ended the long series of nearly unbroken victories jackson had become the alter * of lee and it is not difficult to understand the sense of loss felt by the commanderinchief in addition to this natural sentiment was deep regret at the death of one personally dear to him and to whom he was himself an object of almost reverent love the personal relations of lee and jackson had from first to last remained the * the slightest cloud had ever arisen to disturb the perfect union in each of admiration and affection for the other it had never occurred to these two great soldiers to ask what their relative position was in the public * was most spoken of and commended or admired human nature is weak at best and the fame of jackson mounting to its dazzling zenith might have disturbed a less magnanimous soul than lees there is not however the slightest reason to believe that lee ever gave the subject a thought entirely free from that vulgar species of ambition which looks with cold eyes upon the success of others as offensive to its own * lee never seems to have instituted any comparison between himself and * praise of his famous lieutenant with sincere * was the first upon every occasion not only to express the fullest sense of jacksons assistance and the warmest admiration of his genius as a soldier but to attribute to him as after the battle of chancellorsville all the merit of every description it is not possible to contemplate this august affection and admiration of the two soldiers for each other without regarding it as a greater glory to them than all their successes in arms lees opinion of jackson and personal sentiment toward him have been set forth in the above sentences the sentiment of jackson for lee was as strong or stronger he regarded him with mingled love and admiration to excite such feelings in a man like jackson it was necessary that lee should be not only a soldier of the first order of genius but also a good and pious man it was in these lights that jackson regarded his commander and from first to last his confidence in and admiration for him never wavered he had defended lee from the criticism of unskilled or ignorant persons from the time when he assumed command of the army in the summer of 1862 at that time some one spoke of lee in jacksons presence as slow the criticism aroused the indignation of the silent soldier and he exclaimed general lee is not slow no one knows the weight upon his * great responsibilities he is commanderinchief and he knows that if an army is lost it cannot be replaced no there may be some persons whose good opinion of me may make them attach some weight to my views and if you ever hear that said of general lee i beg you will contradict it in my name i have known general lee for * years he is cautious he ought to be but he is not slow lee is a phenomenon he is the only man whom i would follow blindfold the abrupt and energetic expressions of jackson on this occasion indicate his profound sense of the injustice done lee by these criticisms and it would be difficult to imagine a stronger statement than that here made by him it will be conceded that he himself was competent to estimate soldiership and in jacksons eyes lee was a * only man whom he would follow blindfold the subsequent career of lee seems to have strengthened and intensified this extreme admiration what lee advised or did was always in jacksons eyes the very best that could be suggested or performed he yielded his own opinions upon every occasion with perfect readiness and cheerfulness to those of lee as to the * loved him revered him looked up to him and never seems to have found fault with him but upon one * he received lees note of congratulation after chancellorsville he then said general lee is very kind but he should give the glory to god this affection and admiration were fully returned by general lee who consulted jackson upon every occasion and confided in him as his personal friend there was seldom any question between them of superior and * except when the exigency required that the decision should be made by lee as commanderinchief jacksons supreme genius indeed made this course natural and no further praise is due lee in this particular save that of modesty and good sense but these qualities are commendable and not universal he committed the greatest * to jackson with the utmost confidence certain that he would do all that could be done and some words of his quoted above express this entire confidence say to general jackson he replied to the young staffofficer at fredericksburg that he knows just as well what to do with the enemy as i do lees personal affection was strikingly displayed after the battle of chancellorsville when jackson lay painfully but no one supposed mortally wounded first at wilderness tavern and then at * prevented from visiting the wounded man by the responsibilities of command now all the greater from jacksons absence and not regarding his hurt as serious as indeed it did not appear to be until toward the last lee sent him continual messages containing good wishes and inquiries after his health the tone of these messages is very familiar and affectionate and leaves no doubt of the character of the relations between the two men give him my affectionate regards he said to one officer and tell him to make haste and get well and come back to me as soon as he can he has lost his left arm but i have lost my right when the wound of the great soldier took a bad turn and it began to be whispered about that the hurt might prove fatal lee was strongly moved and said with deep feeling surely general jackson must recover god will not take him from us now that we need him so much surely he will be spared to us in answer to the many prayers which are offered for him he paused after uttering these words laboring evidently under very deep and painful emotion after remaining silent for some moments he added when you return i trust you will find him better when a suitable occasion offers give him my love and tell him that i wrestled in prayer for him last night as i never prayed i believe for myself the tone of these messages is as we have said that of familiar affection as from one valued friend to another the expression give him my love is a * which is used only when two persons are closely and firmly bound by long association and friendship such had been the case with lee and jackson and in the annals of the war there is no other instance of a friendship so close affectionate and unalloyed jackson died on the 10th of may and the unexpected intelligence shocked lee profoundly he mourned the death of the illustrious soldier with a sorrow too deep almost to find relief in tears and issued a general order to the troops which was in the following words it is probable that the composition of this order cost general lee one of the severest pangs he ever experienced the defeat of general hooker at chancellorsville was the turningpoint of the war and for the first time there was apparently a possibility of inducing the federal government to relinquish its opposition to the establishment of a separate authority in the south the idea of the formation of a southern confederacy distinct from the old union had up to this time been repudiated by the authorities at washington as a thing utterly out of the question but the defeat of the federal arms in the two great battles of the rappahannock had caused the most determined opponents of separation to doubt whether the south could be * to return to the union and what was equally or more important the proclamations of president lincoln declaring the slaves of the south free and placing the united states virtually under martial law aroused a violent clamor from the great democratic party of the north who loudly asserted that all constitutional liberty was disappearing this combination of * in military affairs and usurpation by the government * the advocates of peace to speak out plainly and utter their protest against the continuance of the struggle which they declared had only resulted in the prostration of all the liberties of the country journals and periodicals violently denunciatory of the course pursued by the government all at once made their appearance in new york and elsewhere a peace convention was called to meet in philadelphia mr * nominee of the democratic party for governor of ohio eloquently denounced the whole policy of endeavoring to subjugate the sovereign states of the south and judge curtis of boston formerly associate judge of the supreme court of the united states published a pamphlet in which the federal president was stigmatized as a usurper and tyrant i do not see wrote judge curtis that it depends upon the executive decree whether a servile war shall be invoked to help twenty millions of the white race to assert the rightful authority of the constitution and laws of their country over those who refuse to obey them but i do see that this proclamation * the southern slaves asserts the power of the executive to make such a decree i do not perceive how it is that my neighbors and myself residing remote from armies and their operations and where all the laws of the land may be enforced by constitutional means should be subjected to the possibility of arrest and imprisonment and trial before a military commission and punishment at its discretion for offences unknown to the * possibility to be converted into a fact at the mere will of the president or of some subordinate officer clothed by him with this power but i do perceive that this executive power is asserted it must be obvious to the meanest capacity that if the president of the united states has an implied constitutional right as commanderinchief of the army and navy in time of war to disregard any one positive prohibition of the constitution or to exercise any one power not delegated to the united states by the constitution because in his judgment he may thereby best subdue the enemy he has the same right for the same reason to disregard each and every provision of the constitution and to exercise all power needful in his opinion to enable him best to subdue the enemy the time has certainly come when the people of the united states must understand and must apply those great rules of civil liberty which have been arrived at by the * efforts of thought and action of their ancestors during seven hundred years of struggle against arbitrary power so far had reached the thunder of lees guns at chancellorsville their roar seemed to have awakened throughout the entire north the great party hitherto lulled to slumber by the plea of military necessity or paralyzed by the very extent of the executive usurpation which they saw but had not had heart to oppose on all sides the advocates of peace on the basis of separation were heard raising their importunate voices and in the north the hearts of the people began to thrill with the anticipation of a speedy termination of the bloody and exhausting struggle the occasion was embraced by mr stephens vicepresident of the confederate states to propose negotiations this able gentleman wrote from georgia on the 12th of june to president davis offering to go to washington and sound the authorities there on the subject of peace he believed that the moment was propitious and wished to act before further military movements were * before any further projects of invasion by * would tend he thought to silence the peace party at the north and again arouse the war spirit the letter of mr stephens was written on the 12th of june and president davis responded by telegraph a few days afterward requesting mr stephens to come to richmond he reached that city on the 22d or 23d of june but by that time lees vanguard was entering maryland and gettysburg speedily followed which terminated all hopes of peace the plan of moving the southern army northward with the view of invading the federal territory seems to have been the result of many circumstances the country was elated with the two great victories of fredericksburg and chancellorsville and the people were clamorous for active operations against an enemy who seemed powerless to stand the pressure of southern steel the army which had been largely augmented by the return of absentees to its ranks new levies and the recall of longstreets two divisions from suffolk shared the general enthusiasm and thus a very heavy pressure was brought to bear upon the authorities and on general lee in favor of a forward movement which it was supposed would terminate in a signal victory and a treaty of peace lee yielded to this view of things rather than urged it he was not opposed to an offensive policy and seems indeed to have shared the opinion of jackson that the scipio * policy was the best for the south his theory from the beginning of the war had been that the true policy of the south was to keep the enemy as far as possible from the interior fighting on the frontier or on federal soil if possible that of the south would there thus be protected from the ravages of the enemy and the further advantage would accrue that the confederate capital richmond would at all times be safe from danger this was an important consideration as events subsequently showed as long as the enemy were held at armslength north of the rappahannock richmond with her network of railroads connecting with every part of the south was safe and the government undisturbed in their capital remained a power in the eyes of the world but with an enemy enveloping the city and threatening her lines of communication the tenure of the place by the government was uncertain when general grant finally thus enveloped the city and laid hold upon the railroads lees army was defeated and the government became fugitive which alone would have struck a mortal blow to its prestige and authority it was to arrive at these results which his sagacity discerned that lee always advocated such movements as would throw back the enemy and drive him if possible from the soil of virginia another important consideration was the question of supplies these were at all times deficient in the confederate armies and it was obviously the best policy to protect as much territory from which supplies might be drawn as possible more than ever before these supplies were now needed and when general lee sent in may or june a requisition for rations to richmond the commissarygeneral is said to have endorsed upon the paper if general lee wishes rations let him seek them in pennsylvania the considerations here stated were the main inducements for that great movement northward which followed the battle of chancellorsville the army and country were enthusiastic the government rather followed than led and throughout the month of may lee was busily engaged in organizing and equipping his forces for the decisive advance experience had now dictated many alterations and improvements in the army it was divided into three corps * each consisting of three divisions and commanded by an officer with the rank of lieutenantgeneral longstreet remained at the head of his former corps ewell succeeded jackson in command of jacksons old corps and ap hill was assigned to a third corps made up of portions of the two others the infantry was thus rearranged in a manner to increase greatly its efficiency and the artillery arm was entirely reorganized the old system of assigning one or more batteries or battalions to each division or corps was done away with and the artillery of the army was made a distinct command and placed under general * pendleton a brave and energetic officer who was thenceforward lees chief of artillery the last arm the cavalry was also increased in efficiency and on the last day of may general lee had the satisfaction of finding himself in command of a wellequipped and * army of sixtyeight thousand three hundred and fiftytwo bayonets and nearly ten thousand cavalry and * all about eighty thousand men never before had the southern army had present for duty as fighting men so large a number except just before the battles on the chickahominy there was however this great difference between the army then and at this time in those first months of 1862 it was made up largely of raw troops who had never heard the discharge of a musket in their lives while now in may 1863 the bulk of the army consisted of lees veterans men who had followed him through the fire of manassas sharpsburg fredericksburg and chancellorsville and could be counted on to effect any thing not absolutely beyond human power general longstreet conversing after the war with a gentleman of the north declared as much the army at that time he said was in a condition to undertake any thing the great game of chess was now about to commence and taking an illustration from that game general lee is reported to have said that he believed he would * queens that is advance and attempt to capture the city of washington leaving general hooker at liberty if he chose so to do to seize in turn upon richmond what the result of so singular a manoeuvre would have been it is impossible to say it would certainly have proved one of the strangest incidents of a war fruitful in varied and shifting events such a plan of operations however if ever seriously contemplated by lee was speedily abandoned he nowhere makes mention of any such design in his published reports and he probably spoke of it only in jest his real aim in the great movement now about to commence is stated with brevity and * absolutely * also with sufficient clearness in his official report the position of the enemy opposite fredericksburg was he says such as to render an attack upon him injudicious it was therefore desirable to manoeuvre him out of * him to return toward * thus free the country of his forces a further result was expected from this movement the lower shenandoah valley was occupied by the enemy under general milroy who with his headquarters at winchester harassed the whole region which he ruled with a rod of iron with the withdrawal of the federal army under general hooker and before the advance of the confederates general milroy would also disappear and the fertile fields of the valley be relieved the whole force of the enemy would thus says lee be compelled to leave virginia and possibly to draw to its support troops designed to operate against other parts of the country he adds in this way it was supposed that the enemys plan of campaign for the summer would be broken up and part of the season of active operations be consumed in the formation of new combinations and the preparations that they would require in addition to these advantages it was hoped that other valuable results might be attained by military success that is to say by a battle which lee intended to fight when circumstances were favorable that he expected to fight not merely to manoeuvre the enemy from virginia is apparent from another sentence of the report it was thought he says that the corresponding movements on the part of the enemy to which those contemplated by us would probably give rise might offer a fair opportunity to strike a blow at the army therein commanded by general hooker the word therein referring to the region north of the potomac in the phrase other valuable results which might be attained by military success the reference is plainly to the termination of the contest by a treaty of peace based upon the independence of the south these sentences taken from the only publication ever made by lee on the subject of the gettysburg campaign express * but distinctly his designs he aimed to draw general hooker north of the potomac clear the valley induce the enemy to send troops in other quarters to the assistance of the main federal army and when the moment came attack general hooker defeat him if possible and thus end the war that a decisive defeat of the federal forces at that time in maryland or pennsylvania would have virtually put an end to the contest there seems good reason to believe following the southern victories of fredericksburg and chancellorsville a third bloody disaster would in all human probability have broken the resolution of the federal authorities with lee thundering at the gates of washington or philadelphia and with the peace party encouraged to loud and importunate protest it is not probable that the war would have continued intelligent persons in the north are said to have so declared since the war and the declaration seems based upon good sense before passing from this necessary preface to the narrative of events it is proper to add that in the contemplated battle with general hooker when he had drawn him north of the potomac lee did not intend to assume a tactical offensive but to force the federal commander if possible to make the attack from this resolution he was afterward induced by circumstances to depart and the result is known what is above written will convey to the reader a clear conception of lees views and intentions in undertaking his last great offensive campaign and we now proceed to the narrative of the movements of the two armies and the battle of gettysburg lee began his movement northward on the 3d day of june just one month after the battle of chancellorsville from this moment to the time when his army was concentrated in the vicinity of gettysburg his operations were rapid and energetic but with a cautious regard to the movements of the enemy pursuing his design of manoeuvring the federal army out of virginia without coming to action lee first sent forward one division of longstreets corps in the direction of culpepper another then followed and on the 4th and 5th of june ewells entire corps was sent in the same * hill remaining behind on the south bank of the rappahannock near fredericksburg to watch the enemy there and bar the road to richmond these movements became speedily known to general hooker whose army lay north of the river near that point and on the 5th he laid a pontoon just below fredericksburg and crossed about a corps to the south bank opposite hill this threatening demonstration however was not suffered by lee to arrest his own movements seeing that the presence of the enemy there was intended for the purpose of observation rather than attack and only aimed to check his operations he continued the withdrawal of his troops by way of culpepper in the direction of the shenandoah valley a brilliant pageant succeeded by a dramatic and stirring incident was now to prelude the march of lee into the enemys territory on the 8th of june the day of the arrival of lees head of column in culpepper a review of stuarts cavalry took place in a field east of the courthouse the review was a picturesque affair general lee was present sitting his horse motionless on a little * erect figure half concealed by the short * falling from his shoulders and the grave face overshadowed by the broad gray * above him from a lofty pole waved the folds of a large confederate flag the long column of about eight thousand cavalry was first drawn up in line and afterward passed in front of lee at a * and his staffofficers leading the charge with sabres at * point a species of military display highly attractive to the gallant and joyous young commander the men then charged in mimic battle the guns of the stuart horseartillery which were posted upon an adjoining hill and as the column of cavalry approached the artillerists received them with a thunderous discharge of blank ammunition which rolled like the roar of actual battle among the surrounding hills this * was kept up for some time and no doubt puzzled the enemy on the opposite shore of the rappahannock on the next * in consequence of a design formed before the review or to ascertain what this discharge of artillery * divisions of federal cavalry supported by two brigades of picked infantry were sent across the river at kellys and beverleys fords east of the courthouse to beat up the quarters of stuart and find what was going on in the southern camps the most extensive * probably of the whole war followed one of stuarts brigades near beverleys ford was nearly surprised and resolutely attacked at daylight by bufords division which succeeded in forcing back the brigade a short distance toward the high range called fleetwood hill in the rear from this eminence where his headquarters were established stuart went to the front at a swift gallop opened a determined fire of artillery and sharpshooters upon the advancing enemy and sent hamptons division to attack them on their left meanwhile however the enemy were executing a rapid and dangerous movement against stuarts rear general gregg commanding the second federal cavalry division crossed at kellys ford below passed the force left in that quarter and came in directly on stuarts rear behind fleetwood hill in the midst of the hard fight in front stuart was called now to defend his rear he hastened to do so by falling back and meeting the enemy now charging the hill the attack was repulsed and the enemys artillery charged in turn by the southerners this was captured and recaptured two or three times but at last remained in the hands of stuart general gregg now swung round his right and prepared to advance along the eastern slope of the hill stuart had however posted his artillery there and as the federal line began to move arrested it with a sudden and destructive fire of shell at the same time a portion of hamptons division under the brave georgian general * young was ordered to charge the enemy the assault was promptly made with the sabre * by carbine or pistol fire and young cut down or routed the force in front of him which dispersed in disorder toward the river the dangerous assault on the rear of fleetwood hill was thus repulsed and the advance of the enemy on the left near the river met with the same ill success general whf lee son of the commanding general gallantly charged them in that quarter and drove them back to the rappahannock receiving a severe wound which long confined him to his bed hampton had followed the retreating enemy on the right under the fire of stuarts guns from fleetwood hill and by nightfall the whole force had recrossed the rappahannock leaving several hundred dead and wounded upon the field this reconnoissance in * federal numbers probably amounting to fifteen * no other result than the discovery of the fact that lee had infantry in culpepper finding that the event of the fight was critical general lee had moved a body of infantry in the direction of the field of action and the gleam of the bayonets was seen by the enemy the infantry was not however engaged on either side unless the federal infantry participated in the initial skirmish near beverleys ford and general lees numbers and position were not discovered we have dwelt with some detail upon this cavalry combat which was an animated affair the handtohand encounter of nearly twenty thousand horsemen throughout a whole day general stuart was censured at the time for allowing himself to be surprised and a ball at culpepper courthouse at which some of his officers were present several days before was pointed to as the origin of this surprise the charge was wholly unjust stuart not having attended the ball nor was there any truth in the further statement that his headquarters were captured in consequence of his negligence his tents on fleetwood hill were all sent to the rear soon after daylight nothing whatever was found there but a section of the horseartillery who fought the charging cavalry with sabres and * over the guns that fleetwood hill was at one time in the hands of the enemy was due not to stuarts negligence but to the numbers and excellent soldiership of general gregg who made the flank and rear attack while stuart was breasting that in front these detached statements which may seem unduly minute are made in justice to a brave soldier who can no longer defend himself this attempt of the enemy to penetrate his designs had not induced general lee to interrupt the movement of his infantry toward the shenandoah valley the federal corps sent across the rappahannock at fredericksburg still remained facing general hill and two days after the fleetwood fight general hooker moved up the river with his main body advancing the third corps to a point near beverleys ford but these movements were disregarded by lee on the same day ewells corps moved rapidly toward chester gap passed through that defile in the mountain pushed on by way of front royal and reached winchester on the evening of the 13th having in three days marched seventy miles the position of the southern army now exposed it to very serious danger and at first sight seemed to indicate a deficiency of soldiership in the general commanding it in face of an enemy whose force was at least equal to his * had extended his line until it stretched over a distance of about one hundred miles when ewell came in sight of winchester hill was still opposite fredericksburg and longstreet halfway between the two in culpepper between the middle and rear corps was interposed the rapidan river and between the middle and advanced corps the blue ridge mountains general hookers army was on the north bank of the rappahannock well in hand and comparatively massed and the situation of lees army seemed excellent for the success of a sudden blow at it it seems that the propriety of attacking the southern army while thus in * suggested itself both to general hooker and to president lincoln but they differed as to the point and object of the attack in anticipation of lees movement general hooker had written to the president probably suggesting a * across the rappahannock somewhere near fredericksburg to threaten richmond and thus check lees advance this however president lincoln refused to sanction in case you find lee coming to the north of the rappahannock president lincoln wrote to general hooker i would by no means cross to the south of it i would not take any risk of being entangled upon the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable to be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or kick the other five days afterward the president wrote i think lees army and not richmond is your true objective point if he comes toward the upper potomac fight him when opportunity offers if he stays where he is fret him and fret him when intelligence now reached washington that the head of lees column was approaching the upper potomac while the rear was south of the rappahannock the president wrote to general hooker if the head of lees army is at martinsburg and the tail of it on the plank road between fredericksburg and chancellorsville the animal must be very slim * you not break him general hooker did not seem to be able to determine upon a decisive course of action in spite of the tempting opening presented to him by lee it would seem that nothing could have been plainer than the good policy of an attack upon hill at fredericksburg which would certainly have checked lees movement by recalling longstreet from culpepper and ewell from the valley but this bold operation did not appear to commend itself to the federal authorities instead of renforcing the corps sent across at fredericksburg and attacking hill general hooker withdrew the corps on the 13th to the north bank of the river got his forces together and began to fall back toward manassas and even remained in ignorance it seems of all connected with his adversarys movements even as late as the 17th of june his * general butterfield wrote to one of his officers try and hunt up somebody from pennsylvania who knows something and has a cool enough head to judge what is the actual state of affairs there with regard to the enemy my impression is that lees movement on the upper potomac is a cover for a * on the south side of the river we cannot go boggling around until we know what we are going after such was the first result of lees daring movement to transfer military operations to the region north of the potomac a northern historian has discerned in his plan of campaign an amount of boldness which seemed to imply a great contempt for his opponent this is perhaps a somewhat exaggerated statement of the case without boldness a commander is but half a soldier and it may be declared that a certain amount of that quality is absolutely essential to successful military operations but the question is did lee expose himself by these movements of his army to probable disaster if his * to the * at his flank a failure of the campaign of invasion would probably have resulted from such an attack either upon hill at fredericksburg or upon longstreet in culpepper inasmuch as ewells column in that event must have fallen back but a defeat of the combined forces of hill and longstreet who were within supporting distance of each other was not an event which general hooker could count upon with any degree of certainty the two corps numbered nearly fifty thousand * is to say twothirds of the southern army general hookers whole force was but about eighty thousand and it was not probable that the eighty thousand would be able to rout the fifty thousand when at chancellorsville less than this last number of southerners had defeated one hundred and twenty thousand there seems little reason to doubt that general lee took this view of the subject and relied on hill and longstreet to unite and repulse any attack upon them while ewells great raiding column drove forward into the heart of the enemys territory that the movement was bold there can certainly be no question that it was a reckless and hazardous operation depending for its success in lees eyes solely on the supposed inefficiency of general hooker does not appear these comments delay the narrative but the subject is fruitful in suggestion it may be pardoned a southern writer if he lingers over this last great offensive movement of the southern army the last it was also one of the greatest and most brilliant the war therefore was to enter upon its second stage in which the south was to simply maintain the defensive but lee was terminating the first stage of the contest by one of those great campaigns which project events and personages in bold relief from the broad canvas and * the pages of history events were now in rapid progress ewells * sharp head of the southern * winchester on the 13th of june and rodes who had been detached at front royal to drive the enemy from berryville reached the lastnamed village on the same day when the force there retreated to winchester on the next morning earlys division attacked the forces of milroy at winchester stormed and captured their star fort on a hill near the place and so complete was the rout of the enemy that their commander general milroy had scarcely time to escape with a handful of his men in the direction of the potomac for this disaster the unfortunate officer was harshly criticised by general hooker who wrote to his government in my opinion milroys men will fight better under a soldier after thus clearing the country around winchester ewell advanced rapidly on martinsburg where he took a number of prisoners and some artillery the captures in two days had been more than four thousand prisoners and twentynine cannon with four hundred horses and a large amount of stores ewell continued then to advance and entering maryland sent a portion of his cavalry under general imboden westward to destroy the baltimore and ohio railroad and another body under general jenkins in advance toward chambersburg meanwhile the rest of the army was moving to join him hill finding that the enemy had disappeared from his front near fredericksburg hastened to march from that vicinity and was sent forward by lee on the track of ewell passing in rear of longstreet who had remained in culpepper the latter was now directed by lee to move along the eastern side of the blue ridge and by occupying ashbys and * gaps protect the flank of the column in the valley from * work in which stuarts cavalry thrown out toward the enemy assisted such was the posture of affairs when general hookers * became so much puzzled and described the federal army as boggling around and not knowing what they were going after lees whole movement it appears was regarded as a feint to cover a * on the south side of the * strange conclusion it would seem in reference to a movement of such magnitude it now became absolutely necessary that lees designs should be * if possible and to effect this object stuarts cavalry force covering the southern flank east of the blue ridge must be driven back this was undertaken in a deliberate manner three corps of cavalry with a division of infantry and a full supply of artillery were sent forward from the vicinity of manassas to drive stuart in on all the roads leading to the mountain a fierce struggle followed in which stuart who knew the importance of his position fought the great force opposed to him from every hill and knoll but he was forced back steadily in spite of a determined resistance and at upperville a handtohand * wound up the movement in which the federal cavalry was checked when stuart fell back toward paris crowned the mountainside with his cannon and awaited a final attack this was not however made night approaching the federal force fell back toward manassas and on the next morning stuart followed them on the same road over which he had so rapidly retreated beyond middleburg lee paid little attention to these operations on his flank east of the mountains but proceeded steadily in personal command of his infantry in the direction of the cumberland valley ewell was moving rapidly toward harrisburg with orders to take that place if he deemed his force adequate general jenkins commanding cavalry preceding the advance of his infantry he had thus pierced the enemys territory and it was necessary promptly to support him hill and longstreet were accordingly directed to pass the potomac at shepherdstown and williamsport the columns united at hagerstown and on the 27th of june entered chambersburg general hooker had followed crossing the potomac opposite leesburg at about the moment when lees rear was passing from maryland into pennsylvania the direction of the federal march was toward frederick from which point general hooker could move in either one of two * across the mountain toward boonsboro which would throw him upon lees communications or northward to westminster or gettysburg which would lead to an open collision with the invading army in a pitched battle at this juncture of affairs just as the federal army was concentrating near frederick general hooker at his own request was relieved from command the occasion of this unexpected event seems to have been a difference of opinion between himself and general halleck the federal generalinchief on the question whether the fortifications at harpers ferry should or should not be abandoned the point at issue would appear to have been unimportant but ill feeling seems to have arisen general hooker resented the action of the authorities and requested to be relieved his request was complied with and his place was filled by majorgeneral george g meade general meade an officer of excellent soldiership and enjoying the repute of modesty and dignity assumed command of the federal army and proceeded rapidly in pursuit of lee the design of moving directly across the south mountain on lees communications if ever entertained by him was abandoned the outcry from pennsylvania drew him perforce ewell with one division had penetrated to carlisle and early with another division was at york everywhere the horses cattle and supplies of the country had been seized upon for the use of the troops and general meade was loudly called upon to go to the assistance of the people thus exposed to the terrible rebels his movements were rapid assuming command on june 28th he began to move on the 29th and on the 30th was approaching the town of gettysburg lee in personal command of the corps of hill and longstreet had meanwhile moved on steadily in the direction of the susquehanna and reaching chambersburg on the 27th of june made preparations to advance upon harrisburg at chambersburg he issued an order to the troops which should find a place in every biography of this great soldier the course pursued by many of the federal commanders in virginia had been merciless and atrocious beyond words general pope had ravaged the counties north of the rappahannock especially the county of culpepper in a manner which reduced that smiling region wellnigh to a waste general milroy with his headquarters at winchester had so cruelly oppressed the people of the surrounding country as to make them * the very mention of his name and the excesses committed by the troops of these officers with the knowledge and permission of their commanders had been such said a foreign writer as to cast mankind two centuries back toward barbarism now the tables were turned and the world looked for a sudden and merciless retaliation on the part of the southerners lee was in pennsylvania at the head of an army thirsting to revenge the accumulated wrongs against their helpless families at a word from him the fertile territory of the north would be made to feel the iron pressure of military rule proceeding on the theory that retaliation is a just principle to adopt toward an enemy fire slaughter and outrage would have burst upon pennsylvania and the black flag which had been virtually raised by generals pope and milroy would have flaunted now in the air at the head of the southern army instead of permitting this disgraceful oppression of noncombatants lee issued at chambersburg the following general order to his troops the noble maxims and truly christian spirit of this paper will remain the undying glory of lee under what had been surely a bitter provocation he retained the calmness and forbearance of a great soul saying to his army the duties exacted of us by civilization and christianity are not less obligatory in the country of the enemy than in our own no greater disgrace could befall the army and through it our whole people than the * of outrage upon the innocent and defenceless we make war only upon armed men and cannot take vengeance for the wrongs our people have suffered without offending against him to whom vengeance * without whose favor and support our efforts must all prove in vain such were the utterances of lee resembling those we might attribute to the ideal christian warrior and indeed it was such a spirit that lay under the plain uniform of the great virginian what he ordered was enforced and no one was disturbed in his person or property of this statement many proofs could be given a pennsylvania farmer said to a northern correspondent in reference to the southern troops i must say they acted like gentlemen and their cause aside i would rather have forty thousand rebels quartered on my premises than one thousand union troops from the journal of colonel freemantle an english officer accompanying the southern army we take these sentences in passing through greencastle we found all the houses and windows shut up the natives in their sunday clothes standing at their doors regarding the troops in a very unfriendly manner i saw no straggling into the houses nor were any of the inhabitants disturbed or annoyed by the soldiers sentries were placed at the doors of many of the best houses to prevent any officer or soldier from getting in on any pretence i entered chambersburg at 6 pm sentries were placed at the doors of all the principal houses and the town was cleared of all but the military passing through or on duty no officer or soldier under the rank of a general is allowed in chambersburg without a special order from general lee which he is very chary of giving and i hear of officers of rank being refused this pass i went into chambersburg again and witnessed the singularly good behavior of the troops toward the citizens i heard soldiers saying to one another that they did not like being in a town in which they were very naturally detested to any one who has seen as i have the ravages of the northern troops in southern towns this forbearance seems most commendable and surprising a northern correspondent said of the course pursued by general jenkins in command of ewells cavalry by way of giving the devil his due it must be said that although there were over sixty acres of wheat and eighty acres of corn and oats in the same field he protected it most carefully and * his horses so that it could not be injured no fences were wantonly destroyed poultry was not disturbed nor did he compliment our blooded cattle so much as to test the quality of their steak and roast of the feeling of the troops these few words from the letter of an officer written to one of his family will convey an idea i felt when i first came here that i would like to revenge myself upon these people for the devastation they have brought upon our own beautiful * home where we could have lived so happily and that we loved so much from which their * has driven you and my helpless little ones but though i had such severe wrongs and grievances to redress and such great cause for revenge yet when i got among these people i could not find it in my heart to molest them such was the treatment of the people of pennsylvania by the southern troops in obedience to the order of the commanderinchief lee in person set the example a southern journal made the sarcastic statement that he became irate at the robbing of * and if he saw the top rail of a fence lying upon the ground as he rode by would dismount and replace it with his own hands this was the position of the great adversaries in the last days of june lee was at chambersburg in the cumberland valley about to follow ewell who was approaching harrisburg early had captured york and the federal army was concentrating rapidly on the flank of the southern army toward gettysburg lee had ordered the movement of early upon york with the object of diverting the attention of the federal commander from his own rear in the cumberland valley the exact movements and position of general meade were unknown to him and this arose in large measure from the absence of stuarts cavalry this unfortunate incident has given rise to much comment and stuart has been harshly criticised for an alleged disobedience of lees plain orders the question is an embarrassing one lees statement is as follows general stuart was left to guard the passes of the mountains ashbys and other gaps in the blue ridge in virginia and observe the movements of the enemy whom he was instructed to harass and impede as much as possible should he attempt to cross the potomac in that event general stuart was directed to move into maryland crossing the potomac east or west of the blue ridge as in his judgment should be best and take position on the right of our column as it advanced this order was certainly plain up to a certain point stuart was to harass and embarrass the movements of the enemy in case they attempted to cross to the north bank of the potomac when they did cross he also was to pass the river either east or west of the blue ridge as in his judgment should seem best so far the order was unmistakable the river was to be crossed at such point as stuart should select either on the lower waters or in the valley lee added however that this movement should be made in such a manner as to enable stuart to take position on the right of our column as it * meaning appearing to be that the cavalry should move between the two armies in order to guard the southern flank as it advanced into the cumberland valley circumstances arose however which rendered it difficult for stuart to move on the line thus indicated with sufficient promptness to render his services valuable the enemy crossed at leesburg while the southern cavalry was near middleburg and from the jaded condition of his horses stuart feared that he would be unable in case he crossed above to place his column between the two armies then rapidly advancing he accordingly took the bold resolution of passing the potomac below leesburg designing to shape his course due northward toward harrisburg the objective point of the southern army this he * at * * on the march he was delayed by many incidents near * he stopped to capture a large train of federal wagons at westminster and hanovertown he was temporarily arrested by combats with the federal cavalry and ignorant as he was of the concentration of lees troops upon gettysburg he advanced rapidly toward carlisle where in the midst of an attack on that place he was recalled by lee such were the circumstances leading to and the incidents attending this movement the reader must form his own opinion of the amount of blame to be justly attached to stuart he always declared and asserted in his report of these occurrences that he had acted in exact obedience to his orders but on the contrary as appears from general lees report those orders were meant to prescribe a different movement he had marched in one sense on the right of the southern column as it advanced but in another sense he had not done so victory at gettysburg would have silenced all criticism of this difference of construction but unfortunately the event was different and the strictures directed at stuart were natural the absence of the cavalry unquestionably embarrassed lee greatly but in his report he is moderate and guarded as usual in his expressions the absence of cavalry he says rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information of general meades movements and the march toward gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the federal army been known to return now to the movements of lees infantry after the arrival of the main body at chambersburg lee was about to continue his advance in the direction of harrisburg when on the night of the 29th his scouts brought him intelligence that the federal army was rapidly advancing and the head of the column was near the south mountain a glance at the map will indicate the importance of this intelligence general meade would be able without difficulty in case the southern army continued its march northward to cross the * range and place himself directly in lees rear in the cumberland valley then the southern forces would be completely * meade would be master of the * lee must retreat east of the mountain or cut his way through the federal army a battle was thus clearly about to be forced upon the southern commander and it only remained for him to so manoeuvre his army as to secure a position in which he could receive the enemys attack with advantage lee accordingly put his column in motion across the mountain toward gettysburg and sending couriers to ewell and early to return from harrisburg and york toward the same point made his preparations to take position and fight on the morning of the 1st day of july this was then the condition of affairs general meade was advancing with rapidity upon the town of gettysburg and lee was crossing the south mountain opposite chambersburg to meet him when the heads of the two columns came together in the vicinity of gettysburg the thunders of battle began the sanguinary struggle which now ensued between the army of northern virginia and the army of the potomac continued for three days and the character of these battles together with their decisive results have communicated to the events an extraordinary interest every fact has thus been preserved and the incidents of the great combat down to the most minute details have been placed upon record the subject is indeed almost embarrassed by the amount of information collected and published and the chief difficulty for a writer at this late day is to select from the mass such salient events as indicate clearly the character of the conflict this difficulty the present writer has it in his power to evade in great measure by confining himself mainly to the designs and operations of general lee these were plain and simple he had been forced to relinquish his march toward the susquehanna by the dangerous position of general meade so near his line of retreat this rendered a battle unavoidable and lee was now moving to accept battle designing if possible to secure such a position as would give him the advantage in the contest before he succeeded in effecting this object battle was forced upon * by general meade but by simple stress of circumstances the federal commander had formed the same intention as that of his * accept and not deliver battleand did not propose to fight near gettysburg he was rather looking backward to a strong position in the direction of westminster when suddenly the head of his column became engaged near gettysburg and this determined every thing a few words are necessary to convey to the reader some idea of the character of the ground gettysburg is a town nestling down in a valley with so many roads * in the place that if a circle were drawn around it to represent the circumference of a wheel the roads would resemble the spokes a short distance south of the town is a ridge of considerable height which runs north and south bending eastward in the vicinity of gettysburg and describing a curve resembling a hook from a graveyard on this high ground it is called cemetery hill or ridge opposite this ridge looking westward is a second and lower range called seminary ridge this extends also north and south passing west of gettysburg still west of seminary ridge are other still lower ranges between which flows a small stream called willoughby run and beyond these distant about ten miles rise the blue heights of the south mountain across the south mountain by way of the village of cashtown lee on the morning of the 1st of july was moving steadily toward gettysburg when hill holding the front suddenly encountered the head of the enemys column in the vicinity of willoughby run this consisted of general bufords cavalry division which had pushed on in advance of general reynoldss infantry corps the foremost infantry of the federal army and now almost before it was aware of hills presence became engaged with him general buford posted his horseartillery to meet hills attack but it soon became obvious that the federal cavalry could not stand before the southern infantry fire and general reynolds at about ten in the morning hastening forward reached the field an engagement immediately took place between the foremost infantry divisions of hill and reynolds a brigade of hills from mississippi drove back a federal brigade seizing upon its artillery but in return archers brigade was nearly surrounded and several hundred of the men captured almost immediately after this incident the federal forces sustained a serious loss general * of the most trusted and energetic lieutenants of general * mortally wounded while disposing his men for action and borne from the field the federal troops continued however to fight with gallantry some of the men were heard exclaiming we have come to stay in reference to which one of their officers afterward said and a very large portion of them never left that ground battle was now joined in earnest between the two heads of column and on each side renforcements were sent forward to take part in this unexpected encounter neither general lee nor general meade had expected or desired it both had aimed in manoeuvring their forces to select ground suitable for receiving instead of making an attack and now a blind chance seemed about to bring on a battle upon ground unknown to both commanders when the sound of the engagement was first heard by lee he was in the rear of his troops at the headquarters which hill had just vacated near cashtown under the south mountain the firing was naturally supposed by him to indicate an accidental collision with some body of the enemys cavalry and when intelligence reached him that hill was engaged with the federal infantry the announcement occasioned him the greatest astonishment general meades presence so near him was a circumstance completely unknown to lee and certainly was not desired by him but a small portion of his forces were up longstreet had not yet passed the mountain and the forces of general ewell although that officer had promptly fallen back in obedience to his orders from the susquehanna were not yet in a position to take part in the engagement under these circumstances if the whole of general meades army had reached gettysburg directly in lees front the advantage in the approaching action must be largely in favor of the federal army and a battle might result in a decisive confederate defeat no choice however was now left general lee the head of his advancing column had come into collision with the enemy and it was impossible to retire without a battle lee accordingly ordered hills corps to be closed up and renforcements to be sent forward rapidly to the point of action he then mounted his horse and rode in the direction of the firing guided by the sound and the smoke which rose above the tranquil landscape it was a beautiful day and a beautiful season of the year the fields were green with grass or golden with ripening grain over which passed a gentle breeze raising waves upon the brilliant surface the landscape was broken here and there by woods in the west rose the blue range of the south mountain the sun was shining through * clouds and in the east the sky was * by a rainbow this peaceful scene was now disturbed by the thundering of artillery and the rattle of musketry the sky was darkened here and there by clouds of smoke rising from barns or * set on fire by shell and beneath rose red tongues of flame roaring in response to the guns each side had now sent forward reinforcements to support the * and an obstinate struggle ensued the proportions of the fight gradually increasing until the action became a regular battle hill although suffering from indisposition which the pallor of his face indicated met the federal attack with his habitual resolution he was hard pressed however when fortunately one of general ewells divisions under rodes * from the carlisle road running northward from gettysburg and came to his assistance ewell had just begun to move from carlisle toward * second division under early being at * a dispatch from lee reached him directing him to return and proceed to gettysburg or cashtown as his circumstances might direct he promptly obeyed encamped within about eight miles of gettysburg on the evening of the 30th and was now moving toward cashtown where johnsons division of his corps then was when hill sent him word that he needed his assistance rodes was promptly sent forward to the field of action early was ordered to hurry back and rodes soon reached the battlefield where he formed his line on high ground opposite the federal right the appearance of this important renforcement relieved hill and caused the enemy to extend his right to face rodes the federal line thus resembled a crescent the left half fronting hill toward the northwest and the right * rodes toward the * town of gettysburg being in rear of the curve an obstinate attack was made by the enemy and by rodes at nearly the same moment the loss on both sides was heavy but rodes succeeded in shaking the federal right when early made his appearance from the direction of york this compelled the federal force to still farther extend its right to meet the new attack the movement greatly weakened them rodes charged their centre with impetuosity early came in on their right with gordons brigade in front and under this combined attack the federal troops gave way and retreated in great disorder to and through gettysburg leaving the ground covered with their dead and wounded to the number of about five thousand and the same number of prisoners in the hands of the confederates the first collision of the two armies had thus resulted in a clear southern victory and it is to be regretted that this important success was not followed up by the seizure of the cemetery range south of the town which it was in the power of the southern forces at that time to do to whom the * blame there * this failure is justly chargeable the writer of these pages is unable to state all that he has been able to ascertain with certainty is the following as soon as the federal forces gave way general lee rode forward and at about four oclock in the afternoon was posted on an elevated point of seminary ridge from which he could see the broken lines of the enemy rapidly retreating up the slope of cemetery range in his front the propriety of pursuit with a view to seizing this strong position was obvious and general lee sent an officer of his staff with a message to general ewell to the effect that he could see the enemy flying that they were disorganized and that it was only necessary to push on vigorously and the cemetery heights were ours just about the moment it would seem when this order was * halfpast * hill who had joined lee on the ridge received a message from general ewell requesting him hill to press the enemy in front while he performed the same operation on his right this statement is taken from the journal of colonel freemantle who was present and noted the hour he adds the pressure was accordingly applied in a mild degree but the enemy were too strongly posted and it was too late in the evening for a regular attack general ewell an officer of great courage and energy is said to have awaited the arrival of his third division johnsons before making a decisive assault upon the arrival of johnson about sunset general ewell prepared to advance and seize upon the eastern terminus of the cemetery range which commanded the subsequent federal position at this moment general lee sent him word to proceed with his troops to the right in case he could do nothing where he was he proceeded to general lees tent thereupon to confer with him and the result was that it was agreed to first assault the hill on the right it was now however after midnight and the attack was directed by lee to be deferred until the next morning it was certainly unfortunate that the advance was not then made but lee in his report attributes no blame to any one the attack he says was not pressed that afternoon the enemys force being unknown and it being considered advisable to await the arrival of the rest of our troops the failure to press the enemy immediately after their retreat with the view of driving them from and occupying cemetery heights is susceptible of an explanation which seems to retrieve the southern commander and his subordinates from serious criticism the federal forces had been driven from the ground north and west of gettysburg but it was seen now that the troops thus defeated constituted only a small portion of general meades army and lee had no means of ascertaining with any degree of certainty that the main body was not near at hand the fact was not improbable and it was not known that cemetery hill was not then in their possession the wooded character of the ground rendered it difficult for general lee even from his elevated position on seminary ridge to discover whether the heights opposite were or were not held by a strong force infantry were visible there and in the plain in front the cavalry of general buford were drawn up as though ready to accept battle it was not until after the battle that it was known that the heights might have been seized * hancock who had succeeded reynolds having to defend them but a single brigade this fact was not known to lee the sun was now declining and the advance upon cemetery hill was deferred until the next day when on the next morning between daybreak and sunrise general lee accompanied by hill longstreet and hood ascended to the same point on seminary ridge and * the opposite heights through his fieldglass they were seen to be occupied by heavy lines of infantry and numerous artillery the moment had passed the rampart in his front bristled with bayonets and cannon general hancock in command of the federal advance had hastened back at nightfall to general meade who was still some distance in rear and reported the position to be an excellent one for receiving the southern attack upon this information general meade had at once acted by one oclock in the morning his headquarters were established upon the ridge and when lee on seminary hill opposite was reconnoitring the heights the great bulk of the federal army was in position to receive his assault the adversaries were thus face to face and a battle could not well be avoided lee and his troops were in high spirits and confident of victory but every advantage of position was seen to be on the side of the enemy the morning of the 2d of july had arrived and the two armies were in presence of each other and ready for battle the question was which of the great adversaries would make the attack general meade was as averse to assuming the offensive as his opponent lees statement on this subject has been given but is here repeated it had not been intended to fight a general battle he wrote at such a distance from our base unless attacked by the enemy general meade said before the war committee afterward it was my desire to fight a defensive rather than an offensive battle and he adds the obvious explanation that he was satisfied his chances of success were greater in a defensive battle than an offensive one there was this great advantage however on the federal side that the troops were on their own soil with their communications uninterrupted and could wait while general lee was in hostile territory a considerable distance from his base of supplies and must for that reason either attack his adversary or retreat he decided to attack to this decision he seems to have been impelled in large measure by the extraordinary spirit of his troops whose demeanor in the subsequent struggle was said by a federal officer to resemble that of men drunk on champagne general longstreet described the army at this moment as able from the singular * which bore it up to undertake any thing and this sanguine spirit was the natural result of a nearly unbroken series of victories at fredericksburg chancellorsville and in the preliminary struggle of gettysburg they had driven the enemy before them in disorder and on the night succeeding this last victory both officers and men spoke of the coming battle as a certainty and the universal feeling in the army was one of profound contempt for an enemy whom they had beaten so constantly and under so many disadvantages contempt of an adversary is dangerous and pride goes before a fall the truth of these pithy * was now about to be shown general lee it is said shared the general confidence of his troops and was carried away by it he says in his report finding ourselves unexpectedly confronted by the federal army it became a matter of difficulty to withdraw through the mountain with our large trains at the same time the country was unfavorable for collecting supplies while in the presence of the enemys main body as he was enabled to restrain our * by occupying the passes of the mountains with regular and local troops a battle thus became in a measure unavoidable but even after the battle when the southern army was much weaker it was found possible without much difficulty to withdraw through the mountains with the trains a stronger motive than this is stated in the next sentence of general lees report encouraged by the successful issue of the engagement of the first day and in view of the valuable results that would ensue from the defeat of the army of general meade it was thought advisable to renew the attack the meaning of the writer of these words is plain the federal troops had been defeated with little difficulty in the first days fight it seemed probable that a more serious conflict would have similar results and a decisive victory promised to end the war general meade it seems scarcely expected to be attacked he anticipated a movement on lees part over the * road southward by giving that direction to his army general lee would have forced his adversary to retire from his strong position on cemetery hill or come out and attack him whether however it was desirable on general lees part to run the risk of such an attack on the southern column in * it is left to others better able than the present writer to determine this unskilled comment must pass for what it is worth it is easy after the event for the smallest to criticise the greatest under whatever influences general lee determined not to retreat either through the south mountain or toward * but marshalled his army for an attack on the position held by general meade the southern lines were drawn up on seminary ridge and on the ground near gettysburg longstreets corps was posted on the right opposite the federal left near the southern end of cemetery ridge next came hills corps extending along the crest nearly to gettysburg there it was joined by ewells line which passing through the town bent round * itself to the position of the federal right which held the high ground curving round in the shape of a hook at the north end of the ridge the federal lines thus occupied the whole cemetery * being higher commanded seminary * consisted counting from right to left of the troops of generals howard hancock sickles sykes and sedgwick the two latter forming a strong reserve to guard the federal left the position was powerful as both flanks rested upon high ground which gave every advantage to the assailed party but on the federal left an accidental error it seems had been committed by general sickles he had advanced his line to a ridge in front of the main range which appeared to afford him a better position but this made it necessary to retire the left wing of his corps to cover the opening in that direction the result was an * effect of which is to expose troops to serious * this faulty disposition of the federal left seems to have induced general lee to direct his main attack at the point in question with the view of breaking the federal line and seizing upon the main ridge in rear in front of general longstreet he says the enemy held a position from which if he could be driven it was thought that our army could be used to advantage in assailing the more elevated ground beyond in order to coperate in this the main attack ewell was ordered at the same time to assail the federal right toward gettysburg and hill directed to threaten their centre and if there were an opening make a real attack these demonstrations against the enemys right and centre lee anticipated would prevent him from renforcing his left longstreet would thus he hoped be enabled to reach the west of the ridge in rear of the federal line and general meade afterward said if they had succeeded in occupying that it would have prevented me from holding any of the ground which i subsequently held at the * is to say that he would have been driven from the entire cemetery range such was the position of the two adversaries and such the design of lee on the 2d of july when the real struggle was about to begin throughout the forenoon of the day about to witness one of those great passages of arms which throw so bloody a glare upon the pages of history scarcely a sound disturbed the silence and it was difficult to believe that nearly two hundred thousand men were watching each other across the narrow valley ready at the word to advance and do their best to tear each other to pieces during all these long hours when expectation and suspense were sufficient to try the stoutest nerves the two commanders were * their lines for the obstinate struggle which was plainly at hand general meade who knew well the ability of his opponent was seeing in person to every thing and satisfying himself that his lines were in order to receive the attack lee was making his preparations to commence the assault upon which there could be little doubt the event of the whole war depended from the gallantry which the federal troops displayed in this battle they must have been in good heart for the encounter it is certain that the southern army had never been in better condition for a decisive conflict we have spoken of the extraordinary confidence of the men in themselves and in their commander this feeling now exhibited itself either in joyous laughter and the spirit of jesting among the troops or in an air of utter indifference as of men sure of the result and giving it scarcely a thought the swarthy gunners still begrimed with powder from the work of the day before lay down around the cannon in position along the crest and passed the moments in uttering * or in slumber and the lines of infantry seated or lying musket in hand were as careless the army was plainly ready and would respond with alacrity to lees signal of the result no human being in this force of more than seventy thousand men seemed to have the least doubt lee was engaged during the whole morning and until past noon in * his preparations for the assault which he designed making against the enemys left in front of longstreet all was not ready until about four in the afternoon then he gave the word and longstreet suddenly opened a heavy artilleryfire on the position opposite him at this signal the guns of hill opened from the ridge on his left and ewells artillery on the southern left in front of gettysburg thundered in response under cover of his * longstreet then advanced his lines consisting of hoods division on the right and * division on the left and made a headlong assault upon the federal forces directly in his front the point aimed at was the salient formed by the projection of general sickless line forward to the high ground known as the peach orchard here as we have already said the federal line of battle formed an angle with the left wing of sickless corps bending backward so as to cover the opening between his line and the main crest in his rear hoods division swung round to assail the portion of the line thus retired and so rapid was the movement of this energetic soldier that in a short space of time he pushed his right beyond the federal left flank had pierced the exposed point and was in direct proximity to the * crest of the ridge upon the possession of which depended the fate of the battle hood was fully aware of its importance and lost not a moment in advancing to seize it his troops largely composed of those famous texas regiments which lee had said fought grandly and nobly and upon whom he relied in all tight places responded to his ardent orders a small run was crossed the men rushed up the slope and the crest was almost in their very grasp success at this moment would have decided the event of the battle of gettysburg and in all probability that of the war all that was needed was a single brigade upon either * force sufficient to seize the crest for neither side held itand with this brigade a rare good fortune or rather the prompt energy of a single officer according to northern historians supplied the federal commander hoods line was rushing up with cheers to occupy the crest which here takes the form of a separate peak and is known as little round top when general warren * of the army who was passing saw the importance of the position and determined at all hazards to defend it he accordingly ordered the federal * which had used the peak as a signalstation but were hastily folding up their flags to remain where they were laid violent hands upon a brigade which was passing and ordered it to occupy the crest and when hoods men rushed up the rocky slope with yells of triumph they were suddenly met by a fusillade from the * brigade delivered full in their faces a violent struggle ensued for the possession of the heights the men fought hand to hand on the summit and the issue remained for some time doubtful at last it was decided in favor of the federal troops who succeeded in driving hoods men from the hill the summit of which was speedily crowned with artillery which opened a destructive fire upon the retreating southerners they fell back sullenly leaving the ground strewed with their dead and wounded hood had been wounded and many of his best officers had fallen for an instant he had grasped in his strong hand the prize which would have been worth ten times the amount of blood shed but he had been unable to retain his hold he was falling back from the coveted crest pursued by that roar of the enemys cannon which seemed to rejoice in his discomfiture an obstinate struggle was meanwhile taking place in the vicinity of the peach orchard where the left of hood and the division of mclaws had struck the front of general sickles and were now pressing his line back steadily toward the ridge in his rear in spite of resolute resistance the federal troops at this point were pushed back to a wheatfield in the rear of the peach orchard and following up this advantage longstreet charged them and broke their line which fell back in disorder toward the high ground in rear in this attack mclaws was assisted by hills right * of anderson with this force longstreet continued to press forward and piercing the federal line seemed about to inflict upon them a great disaster by seizing the commanding position occupied by the federal left nothing appears to have saved them at this moment from decisive defeat but the masterly concentration of renforcements after renforcements at the point of danger the heavy reserves under generals sykes and sedgwick were opposite this point and other troops were hastened forward to oppose longstreet this renforcement was continuous throughout the entire afternoon in spite of lees demonstrations in other quarters to direct attention general * by * to move fresh troops incessantly to protect his left and success finally came as the reward of his energy and soldiership longstreet found his weary troops met at every new step in advance by fresh lines and as night had now come he discontinued the attack the federal lines had been driven considerably beyond the point which they had held before the assault and were now east of the wheatfield where some of the hardest fighting of the day had taken place but in spite of this loss of ground they had suffered no serious disaster and above all lee had not seized upon that crest of the ridge which was the keystone of the position thus longstreets attack had been neither a success nor a failure he had not accomplished all that was expected but he had driven back the enemy from their advanced position and held strong ground in their front a continuance of the assault was therefore deferred until the next * having now * general longstreet ordered the advance to cease and the firing to be discontinued during the action on the right hill had continued to make heavy demonstrations on the federal centre and ewell had met with excellent success in the attack directed by lee to be made against the enemys right this was posted upon the semicircular eminence a little southeast of gettysburg and the federal works were attacked by ewell about sunset with earlys division on his right and johnsons on his left ewell advanced across the open ground in face of a heavy artilleryfire the men rushed up the slope and in a brief space of time the federal artillerists and infantry were driven from the works which at nightfall remained in ewells hands such had been the fate of the second struggle around gettysburg the moon which rose just as the fighting terminated threw its ghastly glare upon a field where neither side had achieved full success lee had not failed and he had not succeeded he had aimed to drive the federal forces from the cemetery range and had not been able to effect that object but they had been forced back upon both their right and left and a substantial advantage seemed thus to have been gained that the confederate success was not complete seems to have resulted from the failure to seize the * hill the crisis of the battle had undoubtedly been the moment when hood was so near capturing this * reference to the importance of which we quoted general meades own words it was saved to the federal army by the presence of mind it seems of a single officer and the gallantry of a single brigade such are the singular chances of battle in which the smallest causes so often effect the greatest results general lee in company with general hill had during the battle occupied his former position on seminary ridge near the centre of his * seated for the greater portion of the time upon the stump of a tree and looking thoughtfully toward the opposite heights which longstreet was endeavoring to storm his demeanor was entirely calm and composed an observer would not have concluded that he was the commanderinchief from time to time he raised his fieldglass to his eyes and rising said a few words to general hill or general long of his staff after this brief colloquy he would return to his seat on the stump and continue to direct his glass toward the wooded heights held by the enemy a notable circumstance and one often observed upon other occasions was that during the entire action he scarcely sent an order during the time longstreet was * about halfpast four until * sent but one message and received but one report having given full directions to his able lieutenants and informed them of the objects which he desired to attain he on this occasion as upon others left the execution of his orders to them relying upon their judgment and ability a singular incident occurred at this moment which must have diverted lee temporarily from his abstracted mood in the midst of the most furious part of the cannonade when the air was filled with exploding shell a confederate band of music between the opposing lines just below general lees position began defiantly playing * and * on their instruments the incident was strange in the midst of such a hurlyburly the bloody battlefield seemed turned into a ballroom with nightfall the firing sunk to silence the moon had risen and the pale light now lit up the faces of the dead and wounded of both sides lees first great assault had failed to secure the full results which he had anticipated from it the weird hours of the moonlit night succeeding the second day at gettysburg witnessed a consultation between lee and his principal officers as to the propriety of renewing the attack on the federal position or falling back in the direction of the potomac in favor of the latter course there seemed to be many good reasons the supplies both of provisions and ammunition were running short the army although unshaken had lost heavily in the * attack in the event of defeat now its situation might become perilous and the destruction of the army of northern virginia was likely to prove that of the southern cause on the other hand the results of the days fighting if not decisive had been highly encouraging on both the federal wings the confederates had gained ground which they still held longstreets line was in advance of the peach orchard held by the enemy on the morning of the second and ewell was still rooted firmly it seemed in their works near gettysburg these advantages were certainly considerable and promised success to the southern arms if the assault were renewed but the most * consideration * a renewal of the attack was the condition of the troops they were undismayed and unshaken either in spirit or efficiency and were known both to expect and to desire a resumption of the assault even after the subsequent charge of pickett which resulted so disastrously the ragged infantry were heard exclaiming weve not lost confidence in the old man this days work wont do him no harm uncle robert will get us into washington yet add to this the fact that the issue of the second day had stirred up in lee himself all the martial ardor of his nature and there never lived a more thorough soldier when he was fully aroused than the virginian all this soldiership of the man revolted at the thought of retreating and abandoning his great enterprise he looked on the one hand at his brave army ready at the word to again advance upon the * that enemy scarce able on the previous day to hold his * weighing every circumstance in his comprehensive mind which looked before and after lee determined on the next morning to try a decisive assault upon the federal troops to storm if possible the cemetery range and at one great blow terminate the campaign and the war the powerful influences which we have mentioned coperating shaped the decision to which lee had come he would not retreat but fight the campaign should not be abandoned without at least one great charge upon the federal position and orders were now given for a renewal of the attack on the next morning the general plan of attack lee says was unchanged except that one division and two brigades of hills corps were ordered to support longstreet from these words it is obvious that lees main aim now as on the preceding day was to force back the federal left in front of longstreet and seize the high ground commanding the whole ridge in flank and reverse to this end longstreet was renforced and the great assault was evidently intended to take place in that quarter but circumstances caused an alteration as will be seen in lees plans the centre thus weakened was from stress of events to become the point of decisive struggle the assaults of the previous day had been directed against the two extremities of the enemy the assault of the third day which would decide the fate of the battle and the campaign was to be the furious rush of picketts division of virginian troops at the enemys centre on cemetery hill a preliminary conflict brought on by the federal commander took place early in the morning ewell had continued throughout the night to hold the enemys breastworks on their right from which he had driven them in the evening as dawn approached now he was about to resume the attack and in obedience to lees orders attempt to dislodge the enemy from other parts of the ridge when general meade took the * and opened upon him a furious fire of cannon which was followed by a determined infantry charge to regain the hill ewell held his ground with the obstinate nerve which characterized him and the battle raged about four * is until about eight oclock at that time however the pressure of the enemy became too heavy to stand general meade succeeded in driving ewell from the hill and the federal lines were * on the commanding ground which they had previously occupied this event probably deranged in some degree general lees plans which contemplated as we have seen an attack by ewell contemporaneous with the main assault by longstreet ewell was in no condition at this moment to assume the offensive again and the pause in the fighting appears to have induced general lee to reflect and * his plans throughout the hours succeeding the mornings struggle lee attended by generals hill and longstreet and their staffofficers rode along the lines reconnoitring the opposite heights and the cavalcade was more than once saluted by bullets from the enemys sharpshooters and an occasional shell the result of the reconnoissance seems to have been the conclusion that the federal * strengthened by breastworks behind which powerful reserves lay * not a favorable point for attack general meade no doubt expected an assault there and aroused to a sense of his danger by the confederate success of the previous day had made every preparation to meet a renewal of the movement the confederate left and centre remained but it seemed injudicious to think of attacking from ewells position a concentration of the southern force there would result in a dangerous separation of the two wings of the army and in the event of failure the enemy would have no difficulty in descending and turning lees right flank and thus interposing between him and the potomac the centre only was left and to this lee now turned his attention a determined rush with a strong column at cemetery hill in his front might wrest that point from the enemy then their line would be pierced the army would follow lee would be rooted on this commanding ground directly between the two federal wings upon which their own guns might be turned and the defeat of general meade must certainly follow such were doubtless the reflections of general lee as he rode along the seminary range scanning through his fieldglass the line of the federal works his decision was made and orders were given by him to prepare the column for the assault for the hard work at hand picketts division of virginian troops which had just arrived and were fresh was selected these were to be supported by heths division of north carolina troops under general pettigrew who was to move on picketts left and a brigade of hills under general wilcox was to cover the right of the advancing column and protect it from a flank attack the advance of the charging column was preceded by a tremendous artilleryfire directed from seminary ridge at the enemys left and centre this began about an hour past noon and the amount of thunder thus * will be understood from the statement that lee employed one hundred and fortyfive pieces of artillery and the enemy replied with * all two hundred and twentyfive guns all discharging at the same time for nearly two hours this frightful hurlyburly continued the harsh roar reverberating ominously in the gorges of the hills and thrown back in crash after crash from the rocky slopes of the two ridges to describe this fire afterward the cool soldier general hancock could find no other but the word terrific their artilleryfire he says was the most terrific cannonade i ever witnessed and the most prolonged it was a most terrific and appalling * possibly hardly ever * while this * was in progress the charging column was being formed on the west of seminary ridge opposite the federal centre on cemetery hill pickett drew up his line with kempers and garnetts brigades in front and armisteads brigade in rear the brigade under general wilcox took position on the right and on the left was placed the division under pettigrew which was to participate in the charge the force numbered between twelve and fifteen thousand men but as will be seen nearly in the beginning of the action pickett was left alone and thus his force of about five thousand was all that went forward to pierce the centre of the federal army the opposing ridges at this point are about one mile asunder and across this space pickett moved at the word his line advancing slowly and perfectly dressed with its red battleflags flying and the sunshine darting from the gunbarrels and bayonets the two armies were silent concentrating their whole attention upon this slow and ominous advance of men who seemed in no haste and resolved to allow nothing to arrest them when the column had reached a point about midway between the opposing heights the federal artillery suddenly opened a furious fire upon them which inflicted considerable loss this however had no effect upon the troops who continued to advance slowly in the same excellent order without exhibiting any desire to return the fire it was impossible to witness this steady and * march under heavy fire without feeling admiration for the soldiership of the troops who made it where shell tore gaps in the ranks the men quietly closed up and the hostile front advanced in the same ominous silence toward the slope where the real struggle all felt would soon begin they were within a few hundred yards of the hill when suddenly a rapid * thundered on their right and shell and canister from nearly fifty pieces of artillery swept the southern line enfilading it and for an instant throwing the right into some disorder this disappeared at once however the column closed up and continued to advance unmoved toward the height at last the moment came the steady * step had become quick time this had changed to doublequick then the column rushed headlong at the enemys breastworks on the slope of the hill as they did so the real thunder began a fearful fire of musketry burst forth and struck them in the face and this hurricane scattered the raw troops of pettigrew as leaves are scattered by a wind that whole portion of the line gave way in disorder and fled from the field which was strewed with their dead and as the other supports had not kept up the virginians under pickett were left alone to breast the tempest which had now burst upon them in all its fury they returned the fire from the breastworks in their front with a heavy volley and then with loud cheers dashed at the enemys works which they reached stormed and took possession of at the point of the bayonet their loss however was frightful garnett was killed armistead fell mortally wounded as he leaped on the breastworks cheering and waving his hat kemper was shot and disabled and the ranks of the virginians were thinned to a handful the men did not however pause the enemy had partially retreated from their first line of breastworks to a second and stronger one about sixty yards beyond and near the crest and here the federal reserve as northern writers state was drawn up four deep this line bristling with bayonets and cannon the virginians now charged in the desperate attempt to storm it with the bayonet and pierce in a decisive manner the centre of the federal army but the work was too great for their powers as they made their brave rush they were met by a concentrated fire full in their faces and on both flanks at the same moment this fire did not so much cause them to lose heart as literally hurl them back before it the whole charging column seemed to melt and disappear the bravest saw now that further fighting was * the works in their front could not be * with the frightful fire of the enemy still tearing their lines to pieces the poor remnants of the brave division retreated from the hill as they fell back sullenly like * from whom their prey had been snatched just as it was in their grasp the enemy pursued them with a destructive fire both of cannon and musketry which * down large numbers if large numbers indeed can be said to have been left the command had been nearly annihilated three generals fourteen fieldofficers and threefourths of the men were dead wounded or prisoners the virginians had done all that could be done by soldiers they had advanced undismayed into the * of a fire unsurpassed perhaps in the annals of war had fought bayonet to bayonet had left the ground strewed with their dead and the small remnant who survived were now sullenly retiring * and if repulsed not whipped such was the last great charge at gettysburg lee had concentrated in it all his strength it seemed when it failed the battle and the campaign failed with it the demeanor of general lee at this moment when his hopes were all reversed and his last great blow at the enemy had failed excited the admiration of all who witnessed it and remains one of the greatest glories of his memory seeing from his place on seminary ridge the unfortunate results of the attack he mounted his horse and rode forward to meet and encourage the retreating troops the air was filled with exploding shell and the men were coming back without order general lee now met them and with his staffofficers busied himself in rallying them uttering as he did so words of hope and encouragement colonel freemantle who took particular notice of him at this moment describes his conduct as perfectly sublime lees countenance he adds did not show signs of the slightest disappointment care or annoyance but preserved the utmost placidity and cheerfulness the hurry and confusion of the scene seemed not to move him in any manner and he rode slowly to and fro saying in his grave kindly voice to the men all this will come right in the end well talk it over afterward but in the mean time all good men must rally we want all good and true men just now numbers of wounded passed him some stretched on * which men wearing the red badge of the ambulance corps were bearing to the rear others limping along bleeding from hurts more or less serious to the badly wounded lee uttered words of sympathy and kindness to those but slightly injured he said come bind up your wound and take a musket adding my friend as was his habit an evidence of his composure and absence of flurry was presented by a slight incident an officer near him was striking his horse violently for becoming frightened and unruly at the bursting of a shell when general lee seeing that the horse was terrified and the punishment would do no good said in tones of friendly remonstrance dont whip him captain dont whip him ive got just such a foolish horse myself and whipping does no good meanwhile the men continued to stream back pursued still by that triumphant roar of the enemys artillery which swept the whole valley and slope of seminary ridge with shot and shell lee was everywhere encouraging them and they responded by taking off their hats and cheering * the wounded joining in this ceremony although exposing himself with entire indifference to the heavy fire he advised colonel freemantle as that officer states to shelter himself saying this has been a sad day for us colonel a sad day but we cant expect always to gain victories as he was thus riding about in the fringe of woods general wilcox who about the time of picketts repulse had advanced and speedily been thrown back with loss rode up and said almost sobbing as he spoke that his brigade was nearly destroyed lee held out his hand to him as he was speaking and grasping the hand of his subordinate in a friendly manner replied with great gentleness and kindness never mind general all this has been my fault it is i who have lost this fight and you must help me out of it in the best way you can this supreme calmness and composure in the commanderinchief rapidly communicated itself to the troops who soon got together again and lay down quietly in line of battle in the fringe of woods along the crest of the ridge where lee placed them as they came up in front of them the guns used in the great cannonade were still in position and lee was evidently making every preparation in his power for the highly probable event of an instant assault upon him in his disordered condition by the enemy it was obvious that the situation of affairs at the moment was such as to render such an attack highly perilous to the southern * a sudden cheering which was now heard running along the lines of the enemy on the opposite heights seemed clearly to indicate that their forces were moving every preparation possible under the circumstances was made to meet the anticipated assault the repulsed troops of pickett like the rest of the army were ready and even eager for of the * it did not come the cheering was afterward ascertained to have been simply the greeting of the men to some one of their officers as he rode along the lines and night fell without any attempt on the federal side to improve their success that success was indeed sufficient and little would have been gained and perhaps much * by a counterattack lee was not defeated but he had not succeeded general meade could with propriety refrain from an attack the battle of gettysburg had been a federal victory thus had ended the last great conflict of arms on northern * a decisive if not a crushing repulse of the southern arms the chain of events has been so closely followed in the foregoing pages and the movements of the two armies have been described with such detail that any further comment or illustration is unnecessary the opposing armies had been handled with skill and energy the men had never fought better and the result seems to have been decided rather by an occult decree of providence than by any other circumstance the numbers on each side were nearly the same or differed so slightly that in view of past conflicts fought with much greater odds in favor of the one side they might be regarded as equal the southern army when it approached gettysburg numbered sixtyseven thousand bayonets and the cavalry and artillery probably made the entire force about eighty thousand general meades statement is that his own force was about one hundred thousand the federal loss was twentythree thousand one hundred and ninety the southern losses were also severe but cannot be ascertained they must have amounted however to at least as large a number even larger perhaps as an attacking army always suffers more heavily than one that is attacked what is certain however is that the southern army if diminished in numbers and strength was still unshaken lee commenced his retreat in the direction of the potomac on the night of the 4th of july that the movement did not begin earlier is the best proof of the continued efficiency of his army and his own willingness to accept battle if the enemy were inclined to offer it after the failure of the attack on the federal centre he had withdrawn ewell from his position southeast of gettysburg and forming a continuous line of battle on seminary ridge awaited the anticipated assault of general meade what the result of such an assault would have been it is impossible to say but the theory that an attack would have terminated in the certain rout of the southern army has nothing whatever to support it the morale of lees army was untouched the men instead of being discouraged by the tremendous conflicts of the preceding days were irate defiant and ready to resume the struggle foreign officers present at the time testify fully upon this point describing the demeanor of the troops as all that could be desired in soldiers and general longstreet afterward stated that with his two divisions under hood and mclaws and his powerful artillery he was confident had the enemy attacked of inflicting upon them a blow as heavy as that which they had inflicted upon pickett the testimony of general meade himself fully * these statements when giving his evidence afterward before the war committee he said my opinion is now that general lee evacuated that position not from the fear that he would be dislodged from it by any active operations on my part but that he was fearful that a force would be sent to harpers ferry to cut off his communications that was what caused him to retire when asked the question did you discover after the battle of gettysburg any symptoms of demoralization in lees army general meade replied no sir i saw nothing of that kind there was indeed no good reason why general lee should feel any extreme solicitude for the safety of his army which after all its losses still numbered more than fifty thousand troops and with that force of veteran combatants experience told him he could count upon holding at bay almost any force which the enemy could bring against him at chancellorsville with a less number he had nearly routed a larger army than general meades if the morale of the men remained unbroken he had the right to feel secure now and we have shown that the troops were as full of fight as ever the exclamations of the ragged infantry overheard by colonel freemantle expressed the sentiment of the whole army recoiling from the fatal charge on cemetery hill and still followed by the terrible fire they had heart to shout defiantly weve not lost confidence in the old man this days work wont do him no harm uncle robert will get us into washington * bet he will lees reasons for retiring toward the potomac were unconnected with the morale of his army the difficulty of procuring supplies he says rendered it impossible to continue longer where we were what he especially needed was ammunition his supply of which had been nearly exhausted by the three days fighting and it was impossible to count upon new supplies of these essential stores now that the enemy were in a condition to interrupt his communications in the direction of harpers ferry and williamsport the danger to which the army was thus exposed was soon shown not to have been * general meade promptly sent a force to occupy harpers ferry and a body of his cavalry hastening across the south mountain reached the potomac near falling waters where they destroyed a pontoon bridge laid there for the passage of the southern army lee accordingly resolved to retire and after remaining in line of battle on seminary ridge throughout the evening and night of the 3d and the whole of the 4th during which time he was busy burying his dead began to withdraw by the fairfield and chambersburg roads on the night of this latter day the movement was deliberate and without marks of haste the rearguard not leaving the vicinity of gettysburg until the morning of the 5th those who looked upon the southern army at this time can testify that the spirit of the troops was * they had been severely checked but there every thing had ended weary covered with dust with wounds whose bandages were soaked in blood the men tramped on in excellent spirits and were plainly ready to take position at the first word from lee and meet any attack of the enemy with a nerve as perfect as when they had advanced for the reasons stated by himself general meade did not attack he had secured substantial victory by awaiting lees assault on strong ground and was unwilling now to risk a disaster such as he had inflicted by attacking lee in position the enthusiasm of the authorities at washington was not shared by the cool commander of the federal army he perfectly well understood the real strength and condition of his adversary and seems never to have had any intention of striking at him unless a change of circumstances gave him some better prospect of success than he could see at that time the retrograde movement of the southern army now began lees trains retiring by way of chambersburg and his infantry over the fairfield road in the direction of hagerstown general meade at first moved directly on the track of his enemy the design of a stern chase was however speedily abandoned by the federal commander who changed the direction of his march and moved southward toward frederick when near that point he crossed the south mountain went toward sharpsburg and on the 12th of july found himself in front of the southern army near williamsport where lee had formed line of battle to receive his adversarys attack the deliberate character of general meades movements sufficiently indicates the * he felt to place himself directly in his opponents front and thus receive the full weight of his attack there is reason indeed to believe that nothing could better have suited the views of general meade than for lee to have passed the potomac before his * event would have signified the entire abandonment of the campaign of invasion leaving victory on the side of the federal army but the elements seemed to * to bring on a second struggle despite the reluctance of both commanders the recent rains had swollen the potomac to such a degree as to render it * and as the pontoon near williamsport had been destroyed by the federal cavalry lee was brought to bay on the north bank of the river where on the 12th as we have said general meade found him in line of battle lees demeanor at this critical moment was perfectly undisturbed and exhibited no traces whatever of anxiety though he must have felt much in his rear was a swollen river and in his front an adversary who had been renforced with a considerable body of troops and now largely outnumbered him in the event of battle and defeat the situation of the southern army must be perilous in the extreme nothing would seem to be left it in that event but surrender or dispersion among the western mountains where the detached bodies would be hunted down in detail and destroyed or captured confidence in himself and his men remained however with general lee and with his line extending from near hagerstown to a point east of williamsport he calmly awaited the falling of the river resolved doubtless if in the mean time the enemy attacked him to fight to the last gasp for the preservation of his army no attack was made by general meade who arriving in front of lee on the 12th did no more on that day than feel along the southern lines for a point to assault on the next day he assembled a council of war and laid the question before them whether or not it were advisable to make an assault the votes of the officers were almost unanimously against it as lees position seemed strong and the spirit of his army defiant and the day passed without any attempt of the federal army to dislodge its adversary while general meade was thus hesitating lee was acting a portion of the pontoon destroyed by the enemy was recovered new boats were built and a practicable bridge was completed near falling waters by the evening of the 13th the river had also commenced falling and by this time was fordable near williamsport toward dawn on the 14th the army commenced moving in the midst of a violent rainstorm across the river at both points and lee sitting his horse upon the rivers bank superintended the operation as was his habit on occasions of emergency loss of rest and fatigue with that feeling of suspense unavoidable under the circumstances had impaired the energies of even his superb physical constitution as the bulk of the rearguard of the army safely passed over the * bridge which lee had looked at with some anxiety as it swayed to and fro lashed by the current he uttered a sigh of relief and a great weight seemed taken from his shoulders seeing his fatigue and exhaustion general stuart gave him some coffee he drank it with avidity and declared as he handed back the cup that nothing had ever refreshed him so much when general meade who is said to have resolved on an attack in spite of the opposition of his officers looked on the morning of the 14th toward the position held on the previous evening by the southern army he saw that the works were deserted the army of northern virginia had vanished from the hills on which it had been posted and was at that moment crossing the potomac pressing on its track toward falling waters the federal cavalry came up with the rear and in the skirmish which ensued fell the brave pettigrew who had supported pickett in the great charge at gettysburg where he had waved his hat in front of his men and in spite of a painful wound done all in his power to rally his troops with this exception and a few captures resulting from accident the army sustained no losses the movement across the potomac had been effected in face of the whole federal army as successfully as though that army had been a hundred miles distant lee moved his army to the old encampment on the banks of the opequan which it had occupied after the retreat from sharpsburg in september 1862 and here a few days were spent in resting we have in the journal of a foreign officer an outline of lees personal appearance at this time and as we are not diverted from these characteristic details at the moment by the narrative of great events this account of lee given by the officer in * freemantle of the british * laid before the reader this personal description is entirely correct except that the word jacket conveys a somewhat erroneous idea of lees undress uniform coat and his hat was generally gray otherwise the sketch is exactly accurate and is here presented as the * description and estimate of a foreign gentleman who had no inducement such as might be attributed to a southern writer to * his portrait such in personal appearance was the leader of the southern * plain soldier in a plain dress without arms with slight indications of rank courteous full of dignity a perfect gentleman and with no fault save an excessive amiability the figure is attractive to the * excited the admiration of a foreign officer and remains in many memories now when the sound of battle is hushed and the great leader in turn has finished his * and lain down in peace the movements of the two armies were soon resumed and we shall briefly follow those movements which led the adversaries back to the rappahannock lee appears to have conceived the design after crossing the potomac at williamsport to pass the shenandoah river and the blue ridge and thus place himself in the path of general meade if he crossed east of the mountain or threaten washington this appears from his own statement owing he says to the swollen condition of the shenandoah river the plan of operations which had been contemplated when we recrossed the potomac could not be put in execution the points fixed upon by lee for passing the mountain were probably * and ashbys gaps opposite berryville and millwood the rains had however made the river in these places * on the 17th and 18th days of july less than a week after lees crossing at williamsport general meade passed the potomac above leesburg and lee moved his army in the direction of chester gap near front royal toward culpepper the new movements were almost * the same as the old when general mcclellan advanced in november 1862 and the adoption of the same plans by general meade involves a high compliment to his predecessor he acted with even more energy as lees head of column was defiling toward chester gap beyond front royal general meade struck at it through manassas gap directly on its flank and an action followed which promised at one time to become serious the enemy was however repulsed and the southern column continued its way across the mountain the rest of the army followed and descended into culpepper from which position when longstreet was detached to the west lee retired taking post behind the rapidan general meade thereupon followed and occupied culpepper his advance being about halfway between culpepper courthouse and the river such was the position of the two armies in the first days of october when lee weary it seemed of inactivity set out to flank and fight his adversary in a work of the present description the writer has a choice between two courses he may either record the events of the war in all quarters of the country as bearing more or less upon his narrative or may confine himself to the life of the individual who is the immediate subject of his volume of these two courses the writer prefers the latter for many reasons to present a narrative of military transactions in all portions of the south would expand this volume to undue proportions and there is the further objection that these occurrences are familiar to all it might be necessary in writing for persons ignorant of the events of the great conflict to omit nothing but this ignorance does not probably exist in the case of the readers of these pages and the writer will continue as heretofore to confine himself to the main subject only noting incidentally such prominent events in other quarters as affected lees movements one such event was the fall of vicksburg which post surrendered at the same moment with the defeat at gettysburg rendering thereafter impossible all movements of invasion and another was the advance of general rosecrans toward atlanta which resulted in the month of september in a southern victory at chickamauga the immediate effect of the federal demonstration toward chattanooga had been to detach longstreets corps from general lees army for service under general bragg general meades force is said to have also been somewhat lessened by detachments sent to enforce the draft in new york and these circumstances had in the first days of october reduced both armies in virginia to a less force than they had numbered in the past campaign general meade however presented a bold front to his adversary and with his headquarters near culpepper courthouse kept close watch upon lee whose army lay along the south bank of the rapidan for some weeks no military movements took place and an occasional cavalry skirmish between the troopers of the two armies was all which broke the monotony of the autumn days this inactivity however was now about to terminate lee had resolved to attempt a flank movement around general meades right with the view of bringing him to battle and a brief campaign ensued which if indecisive and reflecting little glory upon the infantry was fruitful in romantic incidents and highly creditable to the cavalry of the southern army in following the movements and describing the operations of the main body of the * * have necessarily been compelled to pass over to a great extent the services of the cavalry in the past campaign these had nevertheless been * arm of the service had exhibited greater efficiency and but for the fact that in all armies the brunt of battle falls upon the * it might be added that the services of the cavalry had been as important as those of the infantry stuart was now in command of a force varying from five to eight thousand sabres and among his troopers were some of the best fightingmen of the south the cavalry had always been the favorite arm with the southern youth it had drawn to itself as privates in the ranks thousands of young men of collegiate education great wealth and the highest social position and this force was * in virginia by such resolute commanders as wade hampton fitz lee william hf lee rosser jones wickham young munford and many others under these leaders and assisted by the * stuart horseartillery under pelham and his successors the cavalry had borne their full share in the hard marches and combats of the army on the chickahominy in the march to manassas and the battles in maryland in the operations on the rappahannock and the incessant fighting of the campaign to gettysburg stuart and his troopers had vindicated their claim to the first honors of arms and if these services were not duly estimated by the infantry of the army the fact was mainly attributable to the circumstance that the fighting of the cavalry had been done at a distance upon the outposts far more than in the pitched battles where in modern times from the improved and destructive character of artillery playing havoc with horses the cavalry arm can achieve little and is not risked the actual losses in stuarts command left however no doubt of the obstinate soldiership of officers and men since the opening of the year he had lost general hampton cut down in a handtohand * at gettysburg general whf lee shot in the fight at fleetwood colonels frank hampton and williams killed in the same action colonel butler torn by a shell major pelham chief of artillery killed while leading a charge about six officers of his personal staff either killed wounded or captured and in the gettysburg campaign he had lost nearly onethird of his entire command of its value to the army the infantry might have their doubts but general lee had none stuart and his horsemen had been the eyes and ears of the army of northern virginia had fought incessantly as well as observed the enemy and lee never committed the injustice of * this indispensable arm which if his official commendation of its operations under stuart is to be believed was only second in importance in his estimation to the infantry itself the army continued nevertheless to amuse itself at the expense of the cavalry and either asserted or intimated on every favorable occasion that the real fighting was done by themselves this flattering assumption might be natural under the circumstances but it was now about to be shown to be wholly unfounded a campaign was at hand in which the cavalry were to turn the tables upon their * critics and silence them where the infantry were doomed to failure in nearly all which they attempted and the troopers were to do the greater part of the fighting and achieve the only successes to the narrative of this brief and romantic episode of the war we now proceed general lees aim was to pass around the right flank of his adversary and bring him to battle and although the promptness of general meades movements defeated the lastnamed object nearly completely the manoeuvres of the two armies form a * study the eminent soldiers commanding the forces played a veritable game of chess with each other there was little hard fighting but more scientific manoeuvring than is generally displayed in a campaign the brains of lee and meade rather than the two armies were matched against each other and the conflict of ideas proved more interesting than the actual fighting in prosecution of the plan determined upon general lee on the morning of the 9th of october crossed the rapidan at the fords above orange courthouse with the corps of ewell and ap hill and directed his march toward madison courthouse stuart moved with hamptons cavalry division on the right of the advancing * fitz lee having been left with his division to guard the front on the * general imboden commanding west of the blue ridge was ordered by lee to advance down the valley and guard the gaps of the mountains on our left we have said that lees design was to bring general meade to battle it is proper to state this distinctly as some writers have attributed to him in the campaign as his real object the design of manoeuvring his adversary out of culpepper and pushing him back to the federal frontier his own words are perfectly plain he set out with the design he declares of bringing on an engagement with the federal * is to say of fighting general meade not simply forcing him to fall back his opponent it seems was not averse to accepting battle indeed from expressions attributed to him he appears to have ardently desired it in case he could secure an advantageous position for receiving the southern attack it is desirable that this readiness in both commanders to fight should be kept in view the fact adds largely to the interest of this brief campaign of manoeuvres in which the army falling back like that advancing sought battle to proceed to the narrative which will deal in large measure with the operations of the * arm of the service as we have said having borne the chief share of the fighting and achieved the only successes stuart moved out on the right of the infantry which marched directly toward madison courthouse and near the village of james city directly west of culpepper courthouse drove in the cavalry and infantry outposts of general kilpatrick on the main body beyond the village continuous skirmishing ensued throughout the rest of the * object being to occupy the enemy and divert attention from the infantry movement in his rear in this he seems to have fully succeeded lee passed madison courthouse and moving as he says by circuitous and concealed roads reached the vicinity of griffinsburg on what is called the sperryville road northwest of culpepper courthouse a glance at the map will show the relative positions of the two armies at this moment general meade lay around culpepper courthouse with his advance about halfway between that place and the rapidan and lee had attained a position which gave him fair hopes of intercepting his adversarys retreat that retreat must be over the line of the orange and alexandria railroad but from griffinsburg to manassas was no farther than from culpepper courthouse to the same point if the federal army fell back as lee anticipated it would be a question of speed between the retreating and pursuing columns and as the narrative will show the race was * few hours lost making the difference between success and failure in lees movement on the morning of the 10th while the infantry were still near griffinsburg general stuart moved promptly down upon culpepper courthouse driving the enemy from their large camps near stonehouse mountain these were elaborately provided with luxuries of every description and there were many indications of the fact that the troops had expected to winter there no serious fighting occurred a regiment of infantry was charged and dispersed by the jefferson company of captain * and stuart then proceeded rapidly to culpepper courthouse where the federal cavalry forming the rearguard of the army awaited him general meade was already moving in the direction of the rappahannock the presence of the southern army near griffinsburg had become known to him he was at no loss to understand lees object and leaving his cavalry to cover his rear he moved toward the river as stuart attacked the federal horse posted on the hills east of the village the roar of cannon on his right steadily drawing nearer indicated that general fitz lee was forcing the enemy in that direction to fall back stuart was now in high spirits and indulged in hearty laughter although the enemys shells were bursting around him ride back to general lee he said to an officer of his staff and tell him we are forcing the enemy back on the rappahannock and i think i hear fitz lees guns toward the rapidan the officer obeyed and found general lee at his headquarters which consisted of one or two tents with a battleflag set up in front on the highway near griffinsburg he was conversing with general ewell and the contrast between the two soldiers was striking ewell was thin cadaverous and supported himself upon a crutch for he had not yet recovered from the wound received at manassas general lee on the contrary was erect ruddy robust and exhibited indications of health and vigor in every detail of his person when stuarts message was delivered to him he bowed with that grave courtesy which he exhibited alike toward the highest and the lowest soldier in his army and said thank you tell general stuart to continue to press them back toward the river he then smiled and added with that accent of sedate humor which at times characterized him but tell him too to spare his * spare his horses it is not necessary to send so many messages he turned as he spoke to general ewell and pointing to the officer who had come from stuart and another who had arrived just before him said with lurking humor i think these two young gentlemen make eight messengers sent me by general stuart he then said to ewell you may as well move on with your troops i suppose general and soon afterward the infantry began to advance stuart was meanwhile engaged in an obstinate combat with the federal cavalry near brandy in the immediate vicinity of fleetwood hill the scene of the great fight in june the stand made by the enemy was resolute but the arrival of general fitz lee decided the event that officer had crossed the rapidan and driven general buford before him the result now was that while stuart was pressing the enemy in his front general buford came down on stuarts rear and fitz lee on the rear of buford the scene which ensued was a grand * of the tragic and * every thing was mingled in wild confusion but the day remained with the southern cavalry who at nightfall had pressed their opponents back toward the river which the federal army crossed that night blowing up the railroad bridge behind them such was the first act of the bustling drama at the approach of lee general meade had vanished from culpepper and so well arranged was the whole movement in spite of its rapidity that scarce an empty box was left behind lees aim to bring his adversary to battle south of the rappahannock had thus failed but the attempt was renewed by a continuation of the flanking movement toward warrenton springs with the design lee says of reaching the orange and alexandria railroad north of the river and interrupting the retreat of the enemy unfortunately however for this project which required of all things rapidity of movement it was found necessary to remain nearly all day on the 11th near culpepper courthouse to supply the army with provisions it was not until the 12th that the army again moved stuart preceded it and after a brisk skirmish drove the enemy from warrenton * in person in front of his column as it charged through the river and up the hill beyond where a considerable body of federal * were put to flight the cavalry then pressed on toward warrenton and the infantry who had witnessed their prowess and cheered them heartily followed on the same road the race between lee and general meade was in full progress it was destined to become complicated and an error committed by general meade came very near exposing him to serious danger it appears that after retreating across the rappahannock the federal commander began to entertain doubt whether the movement had not been hasty and would not justly subject him to the charge of yielding to sudden panic influenced apparently by this sentiment he now ordered three corps of the federal army with a division of cavalry back to culpepper and this the main body accordingly crossed back leaving but one corps north of the river such was now the very peculiar situation of the two armies general lee was moving steadily in the direction of warrenton to cut off his adversary from manassas and that adversary was moving back into culpepper to hunt up lee there the comedy of errors was soon terminated but not so soon as it otherwise would have been but for a ruse de guerre played by generals rosser and young general rosser had been left by stuart near brandy with about two hundred horsemen and one gun and when the three infantry corps and the cavalry division of general meade moved forward from the river they encountered this obstacle insignificant as was his force general rosser so manoeuvred it as to produce the impression that it was considerable and though forced of course to fall back he did so fighting at every step assistance reached him just at dusk in the shape of a brigade of cavalry from above the courthouse under general young the same officer whose charge at the fleetwood fight had had so important a bearing upon the result there young now formed line with his men dismounted and advancing with a confident air opened fire upon the federal army the darkness proved friendly and taking advantage of it general young kindled fires along a front of more than a mile ordered his band to play and must have caused the enemy to doubt whether lee was not still in large force near culpepper courthouse they accordingly went into camp to await the return of daylight when at midnight a * courier came with orders from general meade these orders were urgent and directed the federal troops to recross the river with all haste general lee it was now ascertained had left an insignificant force in culpepper and with nearly his whole army was moving rapidly toward warrenton to cut off his adversary the game of * change the * now in full progress and nothing more dramatic could be conceived of than the relative positions of the two armies at midnight on monday october 12th lees army was near warrenton springs ready to advance in the morning upon warrenton while three of the four corps under general meade were halfway between the rappahannock and culpepper courthouse expecting battle there thus a choice of two courses was presented to the federal commander to order back his main force and rapidly retreat toward manassas or move the fourth corps to support it and place his whole army directly in lees rear the occasion demanded instant decision every hour now counted but unfortunately for general meade he was still in the dark as to the actual amount of lees force in culpepper the movement toward warrenton might be a mere ruse the great master of the art of war to whom he was opposed might have laid this trap for * counted upon his falling into the * while a portion of the southern force was engaged in culpepper might design an attack with the rest upon the federal right flank or rear in fact the situation of affairs was so anomalous and puzzling that lee might design almost any thing and succeed in crushing his adversary the real state of the case was that lee designed nothing of this description having had no intimation whatever of general meades new movement back toward culpepper he was advancing toward warrenton under the impression that his adversary was retreating and aimed to come up with him somewhere near that place and bring him to battle upon this theory his opponent now acted by promptly ordering back his three corps to the north bank of the rappahannock they began to march soon after midnight recrossed the river near the railroad and on the morning of the 13th hastened forward by rapid marches to pass the dangerous point near warrenton toward which lee was also moving with his infantry in this race every advantage seemed to be on the side of lee the three federal corps had fully twice as far to march as the southern forces lee was concentrating near warrenton while they were far in the rear and if the confederates moved with only half the rapidity of their adversaries they were certain to intercept them and compel them either to surrender or cut their way through these * * necessary to the comprehension of the singular situation we proceed now with the narrative stuart had pushed on past warrenton with his cavalry toward the orange railroad when on the night of the 13th he met with one of those adventures which were thickly strewed throughout his romantic career he was near auburn just at nightfall when as his rearguard closed up information reached him from that quarter that the federal army was passing directly in his rear nearly at the same moment intelligence arrived that another column of the enemy consisting like the first of infantry cavalry and artillery was moving across his front stuart was now in an actual trap and his situation was perilous in the extreme he was enclosed between two moving walls of enemies and if discovered his fate seemed sealed but one course was left him to preserve if possible complete silence in his command to lie * in the wood and await the occurrence of some fortunate event to extricate him from his * situation he accordingly issued * orders to the men that no noise of any description should be made and not a word be uttered and there was little necessity to repeat this command the troopers remained silent and motionless in the saddle throughout the night ready at any instant to move at the order and thus passed the long hours of * southern horsemen as silent as phantoms the federal columns passing rapidly with the roll of * the tramp of * and the shuffling sound of feet on both sides of the * column moving in rear of stuart being distant but two or three hundred yards this romantic incident was destined to terminate fortunately for stuart who having dispatched scouts to steal through the federal column and announce his situation to general lee prepared to seize upon the first opportunity to release his command from its imminent peril the opportunity came at dawn the federal rear under general * had bivouacked near and had just kindled fires to cook their breakfast when from the valley beneath the hill on which the troops had halted stuart opened suddenly upon them with his horseartillery and as he says in his report knocked over * and other utensils at the moment when the men least expected it he then advanced his sharpshooters and directed a rapid fire upon the disordered troops and under cover of this fire wheeled to the left and emerged safely toward warrenton the army greeted him with cheers and he was himself in the highest spirits he had certainly good reason for this joy for he had just grazed destruction as stuarts artillery opened the sound was taken up toward warrenton where ewell in obedience to lees orders had attacked the federal column nothing resulted however from this assault general meade had concentrated his army and was hastening toward manassas all now depended again upon the celerity of lees movements in pursuit he had lost many hours at warrenton where another halt was made he says to supply the troops with provisions thus on the morning of the 14th he was as far from intercepting general meade as before and all now depended upon the movements of hill who while ewell moved toward * had been sent by way of new baltimore to come in on the federal line of retreat at bristoe station near manassas in spite however of his excellent soldiership and habitual promptness hill did not arrive in time he made the dtour prescribed by lee passed new baltimore and hastened on toward bristoe where on approaching that point he found only the rearguard of the federal * whole force with this exception having crossed broad run and hastened on toward manassas hills arrival had thus been tardy it would have been fortunate for him if he had not arrived at all seeing the federal column under general warren hastening along the railroad to pass broad run he ordered a prompt attack and cookes brigade led the charge the result was unfortunate for the confederates general warren seeing his peril had promptly disposed his line behind the railroad embankment at the spot where protected by this impromptu breastwork the men rested their guns upon the iron rails and poured a destructive fire upon the southerners rushing down the open slope in front by this fire general cooke was severely wounded and fell and his brigade lost a considerable part of its numbers before a new attack could be made general warren hastily withdrew carrying off with him in triumph a number of prisoners and five pieces of artillery captured on the banks of the run before his retreat could be again interrupted he was safe on the opposite side of the stream and lost no time in hurrying forward to join the main body which was retreating on centreville general meade had thus completely foiled his adversary lee had set out with the intention of bringing the federal commander to battle had not succeeded in doing so owing to the rapidity of his retreat had come up only with his rearguard under circumstances which seemed to seal the fate of that detached force and the small rearguard had repulsed him completely capturing prisoners and artillery from him and retiring in triumph such had been the issue of the campaign all the success had been on the side of general meade he is said to have declared that it was like pulling out his * not to have had a fight but something resembling * fighting had occurred on the banks of broad run and the victory was clearly on the side of the federal troops to turn to general lee it would be an interesting question to discuss whether he really desired to intercept general meade if there were any data upon which to base a decision the writer hazards the observation that it seems doubtful whether this was lees intention he had a high opinion of general meade and is said to have declared of that commander that he gave him lee as much trouble as any of them lee was thus opposed to a soldier whose ability he respected and it appears doubtful whether he desired to move so rapidly as to expose his own communications to interruption by his adversary this view seems to derive support from the apparently unnecessary delays at culpepper courthouse and warrenton there was certainly no good reason why under ordinary circumstances an army so accustomed to rapid marches as the army of northern virginia should not have been able to reach warrenton from the neighborhood of culpepper courthouse in less than four days we were compelled to halt lee writes of the delay at culpepper but of that at warrenton he simply says another halt was made whether these views have or have not foundation the reader must judge we shall aim in a few pages to conclude our account of this interesting campaign lee rode forward to the field upon which general hill had sustained his bloody repulse and * and mortified at the * to explain the * and vindicate himself from censure lee is said to have listened in silence as they rode among the dead bodies and to have at length replied gravely and sadly well well general bury these poor men and let us say no more about it he had issued orders that the troops should cease the pursuit and riding on the next morning with general stuart to the summit of a hill overlooking broad run dismounted and held a brief conversation with the commander of his cavalry looking intently as he spoke in the direction of manassas his demeanor was that of a person who is far from pleased with the course of events and the word glum best describes his expression the safe retreat of general meade with the heavy blow struck by him in retiring was indeed enough to account for this * the campaign was altogether a failure since general meades position at centreville was unassailable and if he were only driven therefrom he had but to retire to the defences at washington lee accordingly gave stuart directions to follow up the enemy in the direction of centreville and ordering the orange and alexandria railroad to be torn up back to the rappahannock put his infantry in motion and marched back toward culpepper we shall now briefly follow the movements of the cavalry stuart advanced to manassas following up the federal rear and hastening their retreat across bull run beyond he then left fitz lees division near manassas in the federal front and moving with hamptons division to the left toward groveton passed the little catharpin proceeded thence through the beautiful autumn forest toward * pan and there found and attacked with his command dismounted and acting as sharpshooters the second corps of the federal army this sudden appearance of southern troops on the flank of centreville is said to have caused great excitement there as it was not known that the force was not general lees army the fact was soon apparent however that it was merely a cavalry attack the federal infantry advanced whereupon stuart retired and the adventurous southern horsemen moved back in the direction of warrenton they were not to rejoin lees army however before a final conflict with the federal cavalry and the circumstances of this conflict were as dramatic and picturesque as the ruse de guerre of young in culpepper and the midnight adventure of stuart near auburn the bold assault on the second corps seemed to have excited the ire of the federal commander and he promptly sent forward a considerable body of his cavalry under general kilpatrick to pursue stuart and if possible come up with and defeat him stuart was near the village of buckland on the road to warrenton when intelligence of the approach of the federal cavalry reached him the movement which followed was suggested by general fitz lee he proposed that stuart should retire toward warrenton with hamptons division while he with his own division remained on the enemys left flank then at a given signal stuart was to face about he general fitz lee would attack them in flank when their rout would probably ensue this plan was carried out to the letter general kilpatrick who seems to have been confident of his ability to drive stuart before him pressed forward on the warrenton road closely following up his adversary when the sudden boom of artillery from general fitz lee gave the signal stuart wheeled at the signal and made a headlong charge upon his pursuers fitz lee came in at the same moment and attacked them in flank and the result was that general kilpatricks entire command was routed and retreated in confusion stuart pursuing as he wrote from within three miles of warrenton to buckland the horses at full speed the whole distance so terminated an incident afterward known among the troopers of stuart by the * title of the buckland races and the southern cavalry retired without further molestation behind the rappahannock the coperation of general imboden in the campaign should not be passed over that officer whose special duty had been to guard the gaps in the blue ridge advanced from berryville to charlestown attacked the federal garrison at the latter place drove them in disorder toward harpers ferry and carried back with him four or five hundred prisoners the enemy followed him closely and he was forced to fight them off at every step he succeeded however in returning in safety having performed more than the duty expected of him lee was now behind the rappahannock and it remained to be seen what course general meade would * he would remain near centreville or strive to regain his lost ground all doubt was soon terminated by the approach of the federal army which marching from centreville on october 19th and repairing the railroad as it advanced reached the rappahannock on the 7th of november lees army at this time was in camp toward culpepper courthouse with advanced forces in front of kellys ford and the railroad bridge general meade acted with vigor on his arrival he promptly sent a force across at kellys ford the southern troops occupying the riflepits there were driven off with the loss of many prisoners and an attack near the railroad bridge had still more unfortunate results for general lee a portion of earlys division had been posted in the abandoned federal works on the north bank at this point and these were now attacked and after a fierce resistance completely routed nearly the whole command was * remnant barely * the way having thus been cleared general meade threw his army across into culpepper general lee retired before him with a heavy heart and a deep melancholy which in spite of his great control over himself was visible in his countenance the * of the campaign had begun and ended in disaster for him in the thirty days he had lost at least two thousand men and was back again in his old camps having achieved absolutely nothing november of the bloody year 1863 had come and it seemed not unreasonable to anticipate that a twelvemonth marked by such incessant fighting at chancellorsville fredericksburg salem church winchester gettysburg front royal bristoe and along the rappahannock would now terminate in peace permitting the combatants on both sides worn out by their arduous work to go into winterquarters and * their energies for the operations of the ensuing spring but general meade had otherwise determined he had resolved to try a last advance in spite of the inclement weather and lees anticipations of a season of rest and refreshment for his troops undisturbed by hostile demonstrations on the part of the enemy were destined speedily to be disappointed the southern army had gone regularly into winterquarters south of the rapidan and the men were * themselves upon the prospect of an uninterrupted season of leisure and enjoyment in their rude cabins built in sheltered nooks or under their * of canvas raised upon logs and fitted with rough but comfortable chimneys built of * * when suddenly intelligence was brought by scouts that the federal army was in motion the fact reversed all their hopes of rest and song and laughter by the good * the musket was taken from its place on the rude walls the cartridgebox assumed and the army was once more ready for * gay hopeful and resolved as in the first days of spring general meade had indeed resolved that the year should not end without another blow at his adversary and the brief campaign known as the advance to mine run followed it was the least favorable of all seasons for active operations but the federal commander is vindicated from the charge of bad soldiership by two circumstances which very properly had great weight with him the first was the extreme impatience of the northern authorities and people at the small results of the bloody fighting of the year gettysburg had seemed to them a complete defeat of lee since he had retreated thereafter without loss of time to virginia and yet three months afterward the defeated commander had advanced upon and forced back his victorious adversary that such should be the result of the years * seemed absurd to the north a clamorous appeal was made to the authorities to order another advance and this general sentiment is said to have been shared by general meade who had declared himself bitterly disappointed at missing a battle with lee in october a stronger argument in favor of active operations lay in the situation at the moment of the southern army lee anticipating no further fighting during the remainder of the year opposed the enemy on the rapidan with only one of his two * of ewell while the * of * thrown back in detached divisions at various points on the orange and the virginia central railroads for the purpose of subsistence during the winter this fact becoming known to general meade dictated it is said his plan of operations an advance seemed to promise from the position of the southern forces a decisive success ewells right extended no farther than * ford on the rapidan and thus the various fords down to chancellorsville were open if general meade could cross suddenly and by a rapid march interpose between ewell and the scattered divisions of hill far in rear it appeared not unreasonable to conclude that lees army would be completely * and that the two corps one after another might be crushed by the federal army this plan which is given on the authority of northern writers exhibited good soldiership and if lee were to be caught unawares promised to succeed without further comment we shall now proceed to the narrative of this brief movement which indecisive as it was in its results was not uninteresting and may prove as attractive to the military student as other operations more imposing and accompanied by * fighting general meade began to move toward the rapidan on november 26th and every exertion was made by him to advance with such secrecy and rapidity as to give him the advantage of a surprise in this however he was disappointed no sooner had his orders been issued and the correspondent movements begun than the accomplished scouts of stuart hurried across the rapidan with the intelligence stuart whose headquarters were in a hollow of the hills near orange and not far from general lees promptly communicated in person to the commanderinchief this important information and lee dispatched immediately an order to general ap hill in rear to march at once and form a junction with ewell in the vicinity of verdierville the latter officer was directed to retire from his advanced position upon the rapidan which exposed him to an attack on his right flank and rear and to fall back and take post behind the small stream called mine run in following with a critical eye the operations of general lee the military student must be struck particularly by one circumstance that in all his movements he seemed to proceed less according to the nice technicalities of the art of war than in accordance with the dictates of a broad and comprehensive good sense it may be said that in choosing position he always chose the right and never the wrong one and the choice of mine run now as a defensive line was a proof of this the run is a small watercourse which rising south of the great highway between orange and chancellorsville flows due northward amid woods and between hills to the rapidan into which it * itself a few miles above germanna general meades main place of crossing this stream is the natural defence of the right flank of an army posted between orange and the rapidan it is also the natural and obvious line upon which to receive the attack of a force marching from below toward gordonsville behind mine run therefore just east of the little village of verdierville general lee directed his two corps to concentrate and at the word the men lounging but now carelessly in winterquarters sprung to arms fell in and with burnished muskets took up the line of march we have spoken of the promptness with which the movement was made and it may almost be said that general meade had scarcely broken up his camps north of the rapidan when lee was in motion to go and meet him on the night of the 26th stuart whose cavalry was posted opposite the lower fords pushed forward in person and bivouacked under some pines just below verdierville and before daylight general lee was also in the saddle and at sunrise had reached the same point the night had been severely cold for winter had set in in earnest but general lee always robust and careless of weather walked down without wrapping and wearing only his plain gray uniform to stuarts impromptu headquarters under the pines where beside a great fire and without other covering than his * the commander of the cavalry had slept since midnight as lee approached stuart came forward and lee said admiringly what a hardy soldier they consulted stuart walking back with general lee and receiving his orders he then promptly mounted and hastened to the front where taking command of his cavalry he formed it in front of the advancing enemy and with artillery and dismounted sharpshooters offered every possible impediment to their advance general meade made the passage of the rapidan without difficulty and as his expedition was * with wagons advanced rapidly the only serious obstruction to his march was made by johnsons division of ewells corps which had been thrown out beyond the run toward the river upon this force the federal third corps under general french suddenly blundered by taking the wrong road it is said and an active engagement followed which resulted in favor of the southerners the verdict of lees troops afterward was that the enemy fought badly but general french probably desired nothing better than to shake off this * into which he had stumbled and to reach in the time prescribed by general meade the point of federal concentration near robertsons tavern toward that point the northern forces now * from the various crossings of the river and stuart continued to reconnoitre and feel them along the entire front fighting obstinately and falling back only when compelled to do so every step was thus contested with sharpshooters and the horseartillery from far below to above * church the federal infantry however continued steadily to press forward forcing back the cavalry and on the 27th general meade was in face of mine run lee was ready hill had promptly marched and his corps was coming into position on the right of ewell receiving intelligence of the enemys movement only upon the preceding day lee had seemed to move the divisions of hill far back toward charlottesville as by the wave of his hand the army was concentrated the line of defence occupied and general meades attempt to surprise his adversary by interposing between his * wings had resulted in decisive failure if he fought now the battle must be one of army against army and what was worst of all it was lee who held all the advantages of position we have spoken of mine run it is a strong defensive position on its right bank and on its left flowing generally between hills and with * banks it is difficult to cross from either side in face of an opposing force and it was lees good fortune to occupy the attitude of the party to be assailed he seemed to feel that he had nothing to fear and was in excellent spirits as were the men an eyewitness describes them as gay lively laughing magnificent in front of his left wing he had already erected works his centre and right were as yet undefended but the task of strengthening the line at these points was rapidly prosecuted lee superintended in person the establishment of his order of battle and it was plain to those who saw him thus engaged that the department of military engineering was a favorite one with him riding along the western bank of the watercourse a large part of which was densely clothed in oak chestnut and hickory he selected with the quick eye of the trained engineer the best position for his * moved it when it had been established on bad * out the positions for artillery and as he thus rode slowly along the works which he had directed seemed to spring up behind him as though by magic as the troops of hill came up and halted in the wood the men seized axes attacked the large trees which soon fell in every direction and the heavy logs were dragged without loss of time to the prescribed line where they were piled upon each other in double walls which were filled in rapidly with earth and thus in an * short space of time the men had defences * which would turn a cannonshot in front for some distance too the timber had been felled and an abatis thus formed a few hours after the arrival of the troops on the line marked out by lee they were rooted behind excellent breastworks with forest stream and abatis in front to delay the assailing force under the fire of smallarms and cannon this account of the movements of the army and the preparations made to receive general meades attack may appear of undue length and minuteness of detail in view of the fact that no battle ensued but the volume before the reader is not so much a history of the battles of virginia which have often been described as an attempt to delineate the military and personal character of general lee which displayed itself often more strikingly in indecisive events than in those whose results attract the attention of the world it was the vigorous brain indeed of the great soldier that made events * off by military acumen and ability the disaster with which he was threatened at mine run lees quick eye for position and masterly handling of his forces completely checkmated an adversary who had advanced to deliver decisive battle with felled trees breastworks and a crawling stream lee reversed all the calculations of the commander of the federal army from the 27th of november to the night of the 1st of december general meade moved to and fro in front of the formidable works of his adversary feeling them with skirmishers and artillery and essaying vainly to find some joint in the armor through which to pierce there was none lee had inaugurated that great system of breastworks which afterward did him such good service in his long campaign with general grant a feature of the military art unknown to * had thus its birth in the woods of america and this fact if there were naught else of interest in the campaign would communicate to the * affair the utmost interest general meade it seems was bitterly opposed to foregoing an attack in spite of the powerful position of his adversary he ordered an assault it is said but this did not take place in consequence it would appear of the reluctance of general warren to charge the confederate right this seemed so strong that the men considered it hopeless when the order was communicated to them each one wrote his name on a scrap of paper and pinned it to his breast that his corpse might be recognized and if possible conveyed to his friends this was ominous of failure general warren suspended the attack and general meade it is said acquiesced in his decision he declared it is related that he could carry the position with a loss of thirty thousand men but as that idea was frightful there seemed nothing to do but retreat lee seemed to realize the embarrassment of his adversary and was in excellent heart throughout the whole affair riding to and fro along his line among his merry * they had never appeared in finer spirits or with greater confidence in their * addressed encouraging words to them exposed himself with entire indifference to the shelling and seemed perfectly confident of the result it was on this occasion that finding a party of his ragged soldiers devoutly kneeling in one of the little glades behind the breastworks and holding a * in the midst of bursting shells he dismounted took off his hat and remained silently and devoutly listening until the earnest prayer was concluded a great revival was then going on in the army and thousands were becoming professors of religion the fact may seem strange to those who have regarded lee as only a * and soldier looking like all soldiers to military success but the religious enthusiasm of his men in this autumn of 1863 probably gave him greater joy than any successes achieved over his federal adversary those who saw him on the lines at mine run will remember the composed satisfaction of his countenance an eyewitness recalls his mild face as he rode along accompanied by hill in his drooping hat simple and cordial early laughing ewell pale and haggard but with a smile de bon coeur he was thus attended sitting his horse upon a hill near the left of his line when a staff officer rode up and informed him that the enemy were making a heavy demonstration against his extreme right infantry or cavalry he asked with great calmness infantry i think general from the appearance of the guns general wilcox thinks so and has sent a regiment of sharpshooters to meet them who commands the regiment asked general lee and it was to introduce this question that this trifle has been mentioned lee knew his army man by man almost and could judge of the probable result of the movement here announced to him by the name of the officer in command finding that general meade would not probably venture to assail him lee determined on the night of december 1st to attack his adversary on the next morning his * on this night yielded to soldierly ardor and he exclaimed they must be attacked they must be attacked his plan is said to have contemplated a movement of his right wing against the federal left flank for which the ground afforded great advantages all was ready for such a movement and the orders are said to have been issued when as the dawn broke over the hills the federal camps were seen to be deserted general meade had abandoned his campaign and was in full retreat toward the rapidan the army immediately moved in pursuit with lee leading the column the disappearance of the enemy was an astounding event to them and they could scarcely realize it an entertaining illustration of this fact is found in the journal of a staffofficer who was sent with an order to general hampton in looking for him says the writer i got far to our right and in a hollow of the woods found a grand guard of the eleventh cavalry with pickets and * out gravely sitting their horses and watching the * for the advance of an enemy who was then retreating across elys ford stuart was pressing their rear with his cavalry while the infantry were steadily advancing but the pursuit was vain general meade had disappeared like a phantom and was beyond pursuit to the extreme regret and disappointment of general lee who halted his troops in great discouragement at parkers store tell general stuart he said with an air of deep melancholy to an officer whom he saw passing that i had received his dispatch when he turned into the brock road and have halted my infantry here not wishing to march them unnecessarily even at that early hour all chance of effective pursuit was lost general meade without wagons and not even with the weight of the rations brought over which the men had consumed had moved with the rapidity of cavalry and was already crossing the river far below he was afterward asked by a gentleman of culpepper whether in crossing the rapidan he designed a real advance certainly he is reported by the gentleman in question to have replied i meant to go to richmond if i could but lees position was so strong that to storm it would have cost me thirty thousand men i could not remain without a * weather was so cold that my sentinels froze to death on post the pursuit was speedily abandoned by general lee as entirely impracticable and the men were marched back between the burning woods set on fire by the federal campfires the spectacle was * numerous fires burning * in the carpet of thick leaves formed picturesque rings of flame resembling brilliant necklaces and as the flames reached the tall trees wrapped to the summit in dry vines these would blaze aloft like gigantic * torches of * fall by the federal commander in his hasty retrograde twentyfour hours afterward the larger part of general lees army were back in their winterquarters in less than a week the * campaign had begun and ended the movement of general meade might have been compared to that of the king of france and his forty thousand men in the song but the campaign was not ill devised was rather the dictate of sound military judgment all that defeated it was the extreme promptness of lee the excellent choice of position and the beginning of that great system of impromptu breastworks which afterward became so powerful an engine against general grant general lees headquarters remained throughout the autumn and winter of 1863 in a wood on the southern slope of the spur called clarkes mountain a few miles east of orange courthouse here his tents had been pitched in a cleared space amid pines and cedars and the ingenuity of the couriers as messengers and orderlies were called in the southern army had fashioned * and walks leading to the various tents the tent of the commanding general occupying the centre of the gentlemen of general lees staff we have not considered it necessary to speak but it may here be said that it was composed of officers of great efficiency and of the most courteous manners from colonel taylor the indefatigable adjutantgeneral to the youngest and least prominent member of the friendly group among these able assistants of the commanderinchief were colonel marshall of maryland a gentleman of distinguished intellect colonel peyton who had entered the battle of manassas as a private in the ranks but on the evening of that day for courage and efficiency occupied the place of a commissioned officer on beauregards staff and others whose names were comparatively unknown to the army but whose part in the conduct of affairs under direction of lee was most important with the gentlemen of his staff general lee lived on terms of the most kindly regard he was a strict * and abhorred the theory that a commissioned officer from considerations of rank should hold himself above the private soldiers but there was certainly no fault of this description to be found at army headquarters and the general and his staff worked together in harmonious coperation the respect felt for him by gentlemen who saw him at all hours and under none of the guise of ceremony was probably greater than that experienced by the community who looked upon him from a distance that distant perspective hiding little weaknesses and revealing only the great proportions of a human being is said to be essential generally to the heroic sublime no man it has been said can be great to those always near him but in the case of general lee this was far from being the fact he seemed greater and nobler day by day as he was better and more intimately known and upon this point we shall quote the words of the brave john b gordon one of his most trusted lieutenants it has been my fortune in life says general gordon from circumstances to have come in contact with some whom the world pronounced * of the earths celebrated and distinguished but i declare it here today that of any mortal man whom it has ever been my privilege to approach he was the greatest and i assert here that grand as might be your conception of the man before he arose in incomparable majesty on more familiar acquaintance this can be affirmed of few men who have ever lived or died and of no other man whom it has ever been my fortune to approach like niagara the more you gazed the more its grandeur grew upon you the more its majesty expanded and filled your spirit with a full satisfaction that left a perfect delight without the slightest feeling of oppression grandly majestic and dignified in all his deportment he was genial as the sunlight of this beautiful day and not a ray of that cordial social intercourse but brought warmth to the heart as it did light to the understanding upon this point general breckinridge too bears his testimony during the last year of that unfortunate struggle he says it was my good fortune to spend a great deal of time with him i was almost constantly by his side and it was during the two months immediately preceding the fall of richmond that i came to know and fully understand the true nobility of his character in all those long vigils he was considerate and kind gentle firm and * i can give no better idea of the impression it made upon me than to say it inspired me with an ardent love of the man and a profound veneration of his character it was so massive and noble so grand in its proportions that all men must admire its heroism and gallantry yet so gentle and tender that a woman might adopt and claim it as her own we beg the reader to observe that in these two tributes to the worth of the great soldier his distinguished associates dwell with peculiar emphasis upon the charms of private intercourse with him and bear their testimony to the fact that to know him better was to love and admire him more and more the fact is easily explained there was in this human beings character naught that was * assumed or pretentious it was a great and massive * gentle too and tender as a womans or a * lay beneath the reserved exterior and made the soldier more beloved as its qualities were better known other men reveal their weaknesses on nearer * only revealed his greatness and he was more and more loved and admired the justice of these comments will be recognized by all who had personal intercourse with the illustrious soldier and in this autumn and winter of 1863 his army lying around him along the rapidan began to form that more intimate acquaintance which uniformly resulted in profound admiration for the man in the great campaigns of the two past years the gray soldier had shared their hardships and never relaxed his fatherly care for all their wants he had led them in battle exposing his own person with entire indifference had never exposed them when it was possible to avoid it and on every occasion had demanded often with disagreeable persistence from the civil authorities that the wants of his veterans should be supplied if all else was neglected these facts were now known to the troops and made lee immensely popular from the highest officers to the humblest private soldiers he was universally respected and beloved the whole army seemed to feel that in the * soldier sleeping like themselves under canvas in the woods of orange they had a guiding and protecting head ever studious of their wellbeing jealous of their * fame and ready both as friend and commander to represent them and claim their due we have spoken of the great revival of religion which at this time took place in the army the touching spectacle was presented of bearded veterans who had charged in a score of combats kneeling devoutly under the rustic roofs of evergreens built for religious gatherings and praying to the god of battles who had so long protected them a commanderinchief of the old european school might have ridiculed these emotional * or at best passed them without notice as freaks in which he disdained to take part lee on the contrary greeted the religious enthusiasm of his troops with undisguised pleasure he went among them conversed with the chaplains assisted the good work by every means in his power and no ordained minister of the gospel could have exhibited a * * or more heartfelt delight than himself at the general extension of religious feeling throughout the army we have related how in talking with * his cheeks flushed and his eyes filled with tears at the good tidings he begged them to pray for him too as no less needing their pious intercession and in making the request he was as always simple and sincere unaccustomed to exhibit his feelings upon this the profoundest and most sacred of subjects he was yet penetrated to his inmost soul by a sense of his own weakness and dependence on divine support and indeed it may be questioned whether any other element of the great soldiers character was so * and controlling as his spirit of love to god it took in the eyes of the world the form of a love of duty but with lee the word duty was but another name for the will of the almighty and to discover and perform this was first and last the sole aim of his life we elaborate this point before passing to the last great campaign of the war since to understand lee in those last days it is absolutely necessary to keep in view this utter subjection of the mans heart to the sense of an overruling * providence which shapes our ends * them how we will we shall be called upon to delineate the soldier meeting adverse circumstances and disaster at every turn with an imperial calmness and a resolution that never shook and up to a certain point this noble composure may be attributed to the stubborn courage of the mans nature there came in due time however a moment of trial when military courage simply was of no * that human being never lived who looking to earthly support alone would not have lost heart and given up the contest lee did not in this hour of conclusive trial either lose heart or give up the struggle and the world not understanding the phenomenon gazed at him with wonder few were aware of the true explanation of his utter serenity when all things were crumbling around him and when he knew that they were crumbling the stout heart of the soldier who will not yield to fate was in his breast but he had a still stronger sentiment than manly courage to support himthe consciousness that he was doing his duty and that god watched over him and would make all things work together for good to those who loved him as yet that last great wrestle of the opposing armies lay in the future the veterans of the army of northern virginia defended the line of the rapidan and the gray commanderinchief in his tent on clarkes mountain serenely awaited the further movements of the enemy during the long months of winter he was busily engaged as usual in official correspondence in looking to the welfare of his men and in preparations for the coming campaign he often rode among the camps and the familiar figure in the wellknown hat cape and gray uniform mounted upon the powerful * famous traveller who survived to bear his master after the * everywhere greeted by the ragged veterans with cheers and marks of the highest respect and regard at times his rides were extended to the banks of the rapidan and in passing he would stop at the headquarters of general stuart or other officers on these occasions he had always some goodhumored speech for all not overlooking the youngest officer but he shone in the most amiable light perhaps in conversing with some old private soldier grayhaired like himself at such moments the generals countenance was a pleasant spectacle a kindly smile lit up the clear eyes and moved the lips * by the grizzled mustache the * of this smile was irresistible and the aged private soldier in his poor tattered * was made to feel by it that his commanderinchief regarded him as a friend and comrade we dwell at too great length perhaps upon these slight personal traits of the soldier but all relating to such a human being is interesting and worthy of record to the writer indeed this is the most attractive phase of his subject the analysis and description of campaigns and battles is an * task to him but the personal * of a good and great man even in his lesser and more familiar traits is a pleasing * portion of his subject upon which he delights to linger what the writer here tries to draw he looked upon with his own eyes the figure of a great calm soldier with kindly sweetness and dignity but above all a charming sincerity and simplicity in every movement accent and expression entirely free from the trappings of high command and with nothing to distinguish him from any other soldier save the * stars on the collar of his * the commanderinchief was * at the very first glance and no less the simple and kindly gentleman his old soldiers remember him as he appeared on many battlefields and will describe his martial seat in the saddle as he advanced with the advancing lines but they will speak of him with even greater pleasure as he appeared in the winters of 1862 and 1863 on the rappahannock and the * gray and simple soldier riding among them and smiling kindly as his eyes fell upon their tattered uniforms and familiar faces in the first days of may 1864 began the immense campaign which was to terminate only with the fall of the confederacy for this which was regarded as the decisive trial of strength the federal authorities had made elaborate preparations new levies were raised by draft to fill up the ranks of the depleted forces great masses of war material were accumulated at the central depots at washington and the government summoned from the west an officer of high reputation to conduct hostilities on what was more plainly than ever before seen to be the theatre of decisive * the officer in question was general ulysses s grant who had received the repute of eminent military ability by his operations in the west he was now commissioned lieutenantgeneral and president lincoln assigned him to the command of all the armies of the united states at that time estimated to number one million men general grant promptly accepted the trust confided to him and relinquishing to majorgeneral sherman the command of the western forces proceeded to culpepper and assumed personal command of the army of the potomac although nominally that army remained under command of general meade the spring campaign was preceded in february by two movements of the federal forces one the advance of general * butler up the peninsula to the chickahominy where for a few hours he threatened richmond only to retire hastily when opposed by a few local troops the other the expedition of general kilpatrick with a body of cavalry from the rapidan toward richmond with the view of releasing the federal prisoners there this failed completely like the expedition up the peninsula general kilpatrick after threatening the city rapidly retreated and a portion of his command under colonel dahlgren was pursued and a large portion killed including their commander it is to be hoped for the honor of human nature that colonel dahlgrens designs were different from those which are attributed to him on what seems unassailable proof papers found upon his body contained minute directions for releasing the prisoners and giving up the city to them and for putting to death the confederate president and his cabinet to return to the more important events on the rapidan general grant assumed the direction of the army of the potomac under most favorable auspices other * general * labored under painful disadvantages from the absence of coperation and good feeling on the part of the authorities the new leader entered upon the great struggle under very different circumstances personally and politically acceptable to the government he received their hearty coperation all power was placed in his hands he was enabled to concentrate in virginia the best troops in large numbers and the character of this force seemed to promise him assured victory general mcclellan and others had commanded troops comparatively raw and were opposed by confederate armies in the full flush of anticipated success general grant had now under him an army of veterans and the enemy he was opposed to had month by month lost strength under these circumstances it seemed that he ought to succeed in crushing his adversary the federal army present and ready for duty may 1 1864 numbered one hundred and * thousand one hundred and * men that of general lee numbered fiftytwo thousand six hundred and twentysix colonel taylor adjutantgeneral of the army states the strictly effective at a little less viz ewell 13000 hill 17000 longstreet 10000 infantry 40000 cavalry and artillery 10000 total 50000 the two statements do not materially differ and require no discussion the force at lees command was a little over onethird of general grants and if it be true that the latter commander continued to receive renforcements between the 1st and 4th days of may when he crossed the rapidan lees force was probably less than onethird of his adversarys longstreet it will be seen had been brought back from the west but the confederates labored under an even more serious disadvantage than want of sufficient force lees army small as it was was wretchedly supplied half the men were in rags and worse still were but onefourth fed against this suicidal policy in reference to an army upon which depended the fate of the south general lee had protested in vain whether from fault in the authorities or from circumstances over which they could exercise no control adequate supplies of food did not reach the army and when it marched to meet the enemy in the first days of may the men were gaunt * and in no condition to enter upon so arduous a campaign there was naught to be done however but to fight on to the end upon the army of northern virginia depleted by casualties and * with the * necessaries depended the fate of the struggle generals grant and lee fully realized that fact and the federal commander had the acumen to perceive that the conflict was to be long and determined he indulged no anticipations of an early or easy success his plan as stated in his official report was to hammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and his resources until by mere attrition if by nothing else there should be nothing left of him but an equal submission with the loyal section of our common country to the constitution and the laws the frightful cost in blood of this policy of hammering continuously and thus wearing away his adversarys strength by mere attrition did or did not occur to general grant in either case he is not justly to be blamed it was the only policy which promised to result in federal success pitched battles had been tried for nearly three years and in victory or in defeat the southern army seemed equally unshaken and dangerous this fact was now felt and acknowledged even by its enemies lees army said a northern writer referring to it at this time is an army of veterans it is an instrument sharpened to a perfect edge you turn its * its flanks are made to be turned this effects little or nothing all that we reckon as gained therefore is the loss of life inflicted on the enemy with an army thus trained in many combats and hardened against misfortune defeat in one or a dozen battles decided nothing general grant seems to have understood this and to have resolutely adopted the programme of * estimating that even if he lost ten men to general lees one he could better endure that loss and could afford it if thereby he crushed the rebellion the military theory of the federal commander having thus been set forth in his own words it remains to notice his programme for the approaching campaign he had hesitated between two * to cross the rapidan below lee moving by his right flank the other above moving by his left the last was abandoned from the difficulty of keeping open communication with any base of supplies and the latter adopted general grant determined to fight lee between culpepper and richmond if he would stand to advance straight upon the city and invest it from the north and west thereby cutting its communications in three directions and then crossing the james river above the city form a junction with the left of majorgeneral butler who moving with about thirty thousand men from fortress monroe at the moment when the army of the potomac crossed the rapidan was to occupy city point advance thence up the south side of james river and reach a position where the two armies might thus unite it is proper to keep in view this programme of general grant lee completely reversed it by promptly moving in front of his adversary at every step which he took in advance and it will be seen that the federal commander was finally compelled to adopt a plan which does not seem to have entered his mind save as a dernier ressort at the beginning of the campaign on the morning of the 4th of may general grant commenced crossing the rapidan at germanna and other fords above chancellorsville and by the morning of the 5th his army was over it appears from his report that he had not anticipated so easy a passage of the stream and greatly * himself upon effecting it so successfully this i regarded he says as a great success and it removed from my mind the most serious apprehension i had entertained that of crossing the river in the face of an active large wellappointed and * army lee had made no movement to dispute the passage of the stream from the fact perhaps that his army was not either large or wellappointed he preferred to await the appearance of his adversary and direct an assault on the flank of his column as it passed across his front from a speech attributed to general meade it would seem to have been the impression in the federal army that lee designed falling back to a defensive position somewhere near the south anna his movements were however very different instead of retiring before general grant in the direction of richmond he moved with his three corps toward the wilderness to offer battle the head of the column consisted of ewells corps which had retained its position on the rapidan forming the right of lees line general ap hill who had been stationed higher up near liberty mills followed and longstreet who lay near gordonsville brought up the rear these dispositions dictated as will be seen the positions of the three commands in the ensuing struggle ewell advanced in front down the old turnpike that one of the two great highways here running east and west which is nearest the rapidan hill came on over the orange plankroad a little south of the turnpike and thus formed on ewells right and longstreet following came in on the right of hill general grant had plunged with his army into the dense and melancholy thicket which had been the scene of general hookers discomfiture his army followed by its great train of four thousand wagons indicating the important nature of the movement had reached wilderness tavern and that brock road over which jackson advanced in his secret * against the federal right in may 1863 in may of 1864 now another federal army had penetrated the sombre and depressing shadows of the interminable thickets of the wilderness and a more determined struggle than the first was to mark with its bloody hand this historic territory to understand the singular combat which now ensued it is necessary to keep in view the fact that nothing more surprised general grant than the sudden appearance of his adversary face to face with him in the wilderness it had not been supposed either by the lieutenantgeneral or his * that lee with his small army would have recourse to a proceeding so audacious it was anticipated indeed that somewhere on the road to richmond lee would make a stand and fight in a * position which would enable him to risk collision with his great adversary but that lee himself would bring on this collision by making an open attack unassisted by position of any sort was the last thing which seems to have occurred to his adversary such however as has been said was the design from the first of the southern commander and he moved with his accustomed celerity and energy as soon as general grant broke up his camps north of the rapidan lee was apprised of the fact and ordered his three corps to concentrate in the direction of chancellorsville those who were present in the southern army at this time will bear record to the soldierly promptness of officers and men on the evening of the 3d of may the camps were the scenes of noise merriment and parade the bands played the woods were alive nothing disturbed the scene of general enjoyment of winterquarters on the morning of the 4th all this was changed the camps were deserted no sound was anywhere heard the troops were twenty miles away fully armed and ready for battle general lee was in the saddle and his presence seemed to push forward his column ewell marching with celerity bivouacked that night directly in face of the enemy and it was the * presence of the troops of this commander which arrested general grant advancing steadily in the direction of spottsylvania courthouse he must have inwardly chafed at a circumstance so unexpected and embarrassing it had been no part of his plan to fight in the thickets of the wilderness and yet an adversary of but onethird his own strength was about to reverse his whole programme and dictate the terms of the first battles of the campaign there was nothing to do however but to fight and general grant hastened to form order of battle for that purpose with general sedgwick commanding his right generals warren and burnside his centre and general hancock his left near the brock road the line thus formed extended from northwest to southeast and as the right wing was in advance with respect to lee that circumstance occasioned the first collision this occurred about midday on the 5th of may and was brought on by general warren who attacked the head of swells column on the old turnpike an obstinate engagement ensued and the division which received the assault was forced back it quickly however reformed and being renforced advanced in turn against general warren and after a hard fight he was driven back with a loss of three thousand men and two pieces of artillery this first collision of the armies on the confederate left was followed almost immediately by a bloody struggle on the centre this was held by ap hill who had marched down the plankroad and was near the important point of junction of that road with the brock road when he was suddenly attacked by the enemy the struggle which ensued was long and determined general lee wrote the assaults were repeated and desperate but every one was repulsed when night fell hill had not been driven back but had not advanced and the two armies rested on their arms awaiting the return of light to continue the battle the morning of the 6th of may came and with the first light of dawn the adversaries as by a common understanding advanced at the same moment to attack each other the battle which followed is wellnigh indescribable and may be said in general terms to have been naught but the blind and desperate clutch of two great bodies of men who could scarcely see each other when they were but a few feet apart and who fired at random rather by sound than sight a southern writer describing the country and the strange combat says the country was * land of thicket undergrowth jungle ooze where men could not see each other twenty yards off and assaults had to be made by the compass the fights there were not even as easy as night attacks in open country for at night you can travel by the stars death came unseen regiments stumbled on each other and sent swift destruction into each others ranks guided by the crackling of the bushes it was not * manoeuvring science had as little to do with it as sight two wild animals were hunting each other when they heard each others steps they sprung and grappled the conqueror advanced or went elsewhere the dead were lost from all eyes in the thicket the curious spectacle was here presented of officers advancing to the charge in the jungle compass in hand attacking not by sight but by the bearing of the needle in this mournful and desolate thicket did the great campaign of 1864 begin here in blind wrestle as at midnight did two hundred thousand men in blue and gray clutch each * and * of encounters war had had nothing like it the genius of destruction tired apparently of the old commonplace killing had invented the unseen death at five in the morning the opponents closed in breast to breast in the thicket each had thrown up here and there slight temporary breastworks of * and dirt beyond this they were unprotected the question now was which would succeed in driving his adversary from these defences almost within a few yards of each other and from behind which crackled the musketry never was sight more curious on the low line of these works dimly seen in the thicket rested the muzzles * flame from the depths rose cheers charges were made and repulsed the lines scarcely seeing each other men fell and writhed and died * bodies lost in the bushes their * drowned in the steady continuous * crash these sentences convey a not * idea of the general character of this remarkable engagement which had no precedent in the war we shall now proceed to speak of general lees plans and objects and to indicate where they failed or succeeded the commanders of both armies labored under great embarrassments general grants was the singular character of the country with which he was wholly unacquainted and general lees the delay in the arrival of longstreet owing to the distance of the camps of the lastnamed officer he had not at dawn reached the field of battle as his presence was indispensable to a general assault this delay in his appearance threatened to result in unfortunate consequences as it was nearly certain that general grant would make an early and resolute attack under these circumstances lee resolved to commence the action and did so counting doubtless on his ability with the thirty thousand men at his command to at least maintain his ground his plan seems to have been to make a heavy demonstration against the federal right and when longstreet arrived throw the weight of his whole centre and right against the federal left with the view of seizing the brock road running southward and forcing back the enemys left wing into the thickets around chancellorsville this brilliant conception which if carried out would have arrested general grant in the beginning of his campaign was very near meeting with success the attack on the federal right under general sedgwick commenced at dawn and the fighting on both sides was obstinate it continued with indecisive results throughout the morning gradually involving the federal centre but nearly at the moment when it began a still more obstinate conflict was inaugurated between general hancock holding the federal left and hill who opposed him on the plankroad the battle raged in this quarter with great fury for some time but attacked in front and flank at once by his able opponent hill was forced back steadily and at last in some disorder a considerable distance from the ground which had witnessed the commencement of the action at this point however he was fortunately met by longstreet that commander rapidly brought his troops into line met the advancing enemy attacked them with great fury and after a bloody contest in which general wadsworth was killed drove them back to their original position on the brock road it now seemed nearly certain that lees plan of seizing upon this important highway would succeed general hancock had been forced back with heavy loss longstreet was pressing on and as he afterward said he thought he had another bull run on them when a singular casualty defeated all general longstreet who had ridden in front of his advancing line turned to ride back when he was mistaken by his own men for a federal cavalryman fired upon and disabled by a musketball this threw all into disorder and the advance was discontinued general lee as soon as he was apprised of the accident hastened to take personal command of the corps and as soon as order was restored directed the line to press forward the most bloody and determined struggle of the day ensued the thicket filled the valleys and as at chancellorsville a new horror was added to the horror of battle a fire broke out in the thicket and soon wrapped the adversaries in flame and smoke they fought on however amid the crackling flames lee continued to press forward the federal breastworks along a portion of their front were carried and a part of general hancocks line was driven from the field the struggle had however been decisive of no important results and from the lateness of the hour when it terminated it could not be followed up on the left lee had also met with marked but equally indecisive success general gordon had attacked the federal right driven the force at that point in disorder from their works and but for the darkness this success might have been followed up and turned into a complete defeat of that wing of the enemy it was only discovered on the next morning what important successes gordon had effected with a single brigade and there is reason to believe that with a larger force this able soldier might have achieved results of a decisive character such had been the character and results of the first conflicts between the two armies in the thickets of the wilderness as we have already said the collision there was neither expected nor desired by general grant who unlike general hooker in may of the preceding year seems fully to have understood the unfavorable nature of the region for manoeuvring a large army his adversary had however forced him to accept battle leaving him no choice and the result of the actions of the 5th and 6th had been such as to determine the federal commander to emerge as soon as possible from the tangled underwood which hampered all his movements on the 7th he accordingly made no movement to attack lee and on the night of that day marched rapidly in the direction of hanover junction following the road by todds tavern toward spottsylvania courthouse for this determination to avoid further fighting in the wilderness general grant gives a singular explanation on the morning of the 7th he says reconnoissance showed that the enemy had fallen behind his intrenched lines with pickets to the front covering a part of the battlefield from this it was evident that the * fighting had satisfied him of his inability to further maintain the contest in the open field notwithstanding his advantage of position and that he would wait an attack behind his works the intrenched lines and advantage of position of lee were both imaginary no lines of intrenchment had been made and the ground was not more favorable on general lees side than on general grants both armies had erected impromptu breastworks of felled trees and earth as continued to be their habit throughout the campaign and the flat country gave no special advantage to either the forward movement of general grant is susceptible of much easier explanation the result of the * fighting had very far from pleased him he desired to avoid further conflict in so difficult a country and taking advantage of the * of lee and the hours of darkness he moved with his army toward the more open country throughout the entire day succeeding this first great conflict general lee remained quiet watching for some movement of his adversary his success in the preliminary * had been gratifying considering the great disproportion of numbers but he indulged no expectation of a retrograde movement across the rapidan on the part of general grant he expected him rather to advance and anxiously awaited some development of this intention there were no indications of such a design up to the night of the 7th but at that time to use the words of a confidential member of lees staff he all at once seemed to conceive the idea that his enemy was preparing to forsake his position and move toward hanover junction via the spottsylvania courthouse and believing this he at once detailed andersons division with orders to proceed rapidly toward the courthouse general anderson commenced his march about nine oclock at night when the federal column was already upon its way a race now began for the coveted position and general stuart with his dismounted sharpshooters behind improvised breastworks harassed and impeded the federal advance at every step throughout the night this greatly delayed their march and their head of column did not reach the vicinity of spottsylvania courthouse until past sunrise general warren leading the federal advance then hurried forward followed by general hancock when suddenly he found himself in front of breastworks and was received with a fire of musketry lee had succeeded in interposing himself between general grant and richmond on the same evening the bulk of the two armies were facing each other on the line of the po by the rapidity of his movements general lee had thus completely defeated his adversarys design to seize on the important point spottsylvania courthouse general grant apparently * some explanation of this untoward event to be necessary writes the enemy having become aware of our movement and having the shorter line was enabled to reach there first the statement that general lee had the shorter of the two lines to march over is a mistake the armies moved over parallel roads until beyond todds tavern after which the distance to the south bank of the po was greater by lees route than general grants the map will sufficiently indicate this two other circumstances defeated general grants attempt to reach the point * extreme rapidity of the march of the confederate advance force and the excellent fighting of stuarts dismounted men who harassed and delayed general warren leading the federal advance throughout the entire night an additional fact should be mentioned bearing upon this point and upon general lees designs general lees orders to me says general early who from the sickness of ap hill had been assigned to the command of the corps were to move by todds tavern along the brock road to spottsylvania courthouse as soon as our front was clear of the enemy from this order it would appear either that general lee regarded the brock road over which general grant moved as the shorter line or that he intended the movement of early on the enemys rear to operate as a check upon them while he went forward to their front with his main body these comments may seem tedious to the general reader but all that illustrates the military designs or * the good soldiership of lee is worthy of record we proceed now to the narrative in the wilderness general grant had found a dangerous enemy ready to strike at his flank he now saw in his front the same active and wary adversary prepared to bar the direct road to richmond general lee had taken up his position on the south bank of one of the four * of the * these four streams are known as the mat * po and * rivers and bear the same relation to the main stream that the fingers of the open hand do to the wrist general lee was behind the po which is next to the * the * of these * both were difficult to cross and their banks heavily wooded it was now to be seen whether either by a front attack or a turning movement general grant could * his adversary and whether general lee would stand on the defensive or attack all day during the 9th the two armies were constructing breastworks along their entire fronts and these works from the rapidan to the banks of the chickahominy remain yet in existence on the evening of this day a federal force was thrown across the po on the confederate left but soon withdrawn and on the 10th a similar movement took place near the same point which resulted in a brief but bloody conflict during which the woods took fire and many of the assaulting troops perished * in the flames the force was then recalled and during that night and the succeeding day nothing of importance occurred although heavy skirmishing and an artilleryfire took place along the lines on the morning of the 12th at the first dawn of day general grant made a more important and dangerous assault than any yet undertaken in the campaign this was directed at a salient on general lees right centre occupied by johnsons division of ewells corps and was one of the bloodiest and most terrible incidents of the war for this assault general grant is said to have selected his best troops these advanced in a heavy charging column through the half darkness of dawn passed silently over the confederate skirmishers scarcely firing a shot and just as the first streak of daylight touched the eastern woods burst upon the salient which they stormed at the point of the bayonet in consequence of the suddenness of the assault and the absence of * whose removal general johnston is stated to have protested and which arrived too * federal forces carried all before them and gained possession of the works in spite of a stubborn and bloody resistance such was the excellent success of the federal movement and the southern line seemed to be hopelessly * nearly the whole of johnsons division were taken * number amounting to about three * eighteen pieces of artillery fell into the hands of the assaulting column the position of affairs was now exceedingly critical and unless general lee could reform his line at the point it seemed that nothing was left him but an abandonment of his whole position the federal army had broken his line was pouring into the opening and to prevent him from concentrating at the point to regain possession of the works heavy attacks were begun by the enemy on his right and left wings it is probable that at no time during the war was the southern army in greater danger of a bloody and decisive disaster at this critical moment general lee acted with the nerve and coolness of a soldier whom no adverse event can shake those who saw him will testify to the stern courage of his expression the glance of the eye which indicated a great nature aroused to the depth of its powerful organization line of battle was promptly formed a short distance in rear of the salient then in the enemys possession and a fierce charge was made by the southerners under the eye of lee to regain it it was on this occasion that on fire with the ardor of battle which so seldom mastered him lee went forward in front of his line and taking his station beside the colors of one of his virginian regiments took off his hat and turning to the men pointed toward the enemy a storm of cheers greeted the general as he sat his gray warhorse in front of the * head bare his eyes flashing and his cheeks flushed with the * of the soldier general gordon however spurred to his side and seized his rein general lee he exclaimed this is no place for you go to the rear these are virginians and georgians * who have never * you will not fail now he cried rising in his stirrups and addressing the troops no no was the reply of the men and from the whole line burst the shout lee to the rear lee to the rear instead of being needed it was obvious that his presence was an embarrassment as the men seemed determined not to charge unless he retired he accordingly did so and the line advanced to the attack led by general gordon and other officers of approved ability and courage the charge which followed was resolute and the word ferocious best describes the struggle which followed it continued throughout the entire day lee making not less than five distinct assaults in heavy force to recover the works the fight involved the troops on both flanks and was desperate and unyielding the opposing flags were at times within only a few yards of each other and so incessant and concentrated was the fire of musketry that a tree of about eighteen inches in * was cut down by bullets and is still preserved it is said in the city of washington as a memorial of this bloody struggle the fighting only ceased several hours after dark lee had not regained his advanced line of works but he was firmly rooted in an interior and * line from which the federal troops had found it impossible to dislodge him this result of the stubborn action was essentially a success as general grants aim in the operation had been to break asunder his adversarys * which he very nearly succeeded at midnight all was again silent the ground near the salient was strewed with dead bodies the loss of the three thousand men and eighteen guns of johnson had been followed by a bloody retaliation the federal commander having lost more than eight thousand men after the bloody action of the 12th of may general grant remained quiet for many days awaiting he says the arrival of renforcements from washington the number of these fresh troops is not known to the present writer general lee had no reinforcements to expect and continued to confront his adversary with his small army which must have been reduced by the heavy fighting to less than forty thousand men while that of general grant numbered probably about one hundred and forty thousand finding that his opponent was not disposed to renew hostilities general lee on the 19th of may sent general ewell to turn his right flank but this movement resulted in nothing save the discovery by general ewell that the federal army was moving this intelligence was dispatched to general lee on the evening of the 21st and reached him at * house on the banks of the po where he was calmly reconnoitring the position of the enemy as soon as he read the note of general ewell he mounted his horse saying in his grave voice to his staff come gentlemen and orders were sent to the army to prepare to move the troops began their march on the same night in the direction of hanover junction which they reached on the evening of the 22d when on may 23d general grant reached the banks of the north anna he found lee stationed on the south bank ready to oppose his crossing the failure of general grant to reach and seize upon the important point of hanover junction before the arrival of lee decided the fate of the plan of campaign originally devised by him if the reader will glance at the map of virginia this fact will become apparent hanover junction is the point where the virginia central and richmond and fredericksburg railroads cross each other and is situated in the angle of the north anna and south anna rivers which unite a short distance below to form the pamunkey once in possession of this point general grant would have had easy communication with the excellent base of supplies at * creek would have cut the virginia central railroad and a direct march southward would have enabled him to invest richmond from the north and northwest in accordance with his original plan lee had however reached the point first and from that moment unless the southern force were driven from its position the entire plan of campaign must necessarily be changed the great error of general grant in this arduous campaign would seem to have been the feebleness of the attack which he here made upon lee the position of the southern army was not formidable and on his arrival they had had no time to erect defences the river is not difficult of crossing and the ground on the south bank gives no decided advantage to a force occupying it in spite of these * it is proper to say general grant denies * was effected and but little attempted a few words will sum up the operations of the armies during the two or three days reaching the river general grant threw a column across some miles up the stream at a point known as jericho ford where a brief but obstinate encounter ensued between generals hill and warren and this was followed by the capture of an old redoubt defending the chesterfield bridge near the railroad crossing opposite lees right which enabled another column to pass the stream at that point these two successful passages of the river on lees left and right seemed to indicate a fixed intention on the part of his adversary to press both the southern flanks and bring on a decisive engagement and to coperate in this plan a third column was now thrown over opposite lees centre these movements were however promptly met lee retired his two wings but struck suddenly with his centre at the force attempting to cross there and then active operations on both sides ceased in spite of having passed the river with the bulk of his army and formed line of battle general grant resolved not to attack his explanation of this is that lees position was found stronger than either of his previous ones such was the result of the able disposition of the southern force at this important point general grant found his whole programme reversed and on the night of the 26th silently withdrew and hastened down the north bank of the pamunkey toward hanovertown preceded by the cavalry of general sheridan that officer had been detached from the army as it approached spottsylvania courthouse to make a rapid march toward richmond and destroy the confederate communications in this he partially succeeded but attempting to ride into richmond was repulsed with considerable loss the only important result indeed of the expedition was the death of general stuart this distinguished commander of general lees cavalry had been directed to pursue general sheridan had done so with his customary promptness and intercepted his column near richmond at a spot known as the yellow tavern and here in a stubborn engagement in which stuart strove to supply his want of troops by the fury of his attack the great chief of cavalry was mortally wounded and expired soon afterward his fall was a grievous blow to general lees heart as well as to the southern cause endowed by nature with a courage which shrunk from nothing active energetic of immense physical * which enabled him to endure any amount of fatigue devoted heart and soul to the cause in which he fought and looking up to the commander of the army with childlike love and admiration stuart could be ill spared at this critical moment and general lee was plunged into the deepest melancholy at the intelligence of his death when it reached him he retired from those around him and remained for some time communing with his own heart and memory when one of his staff entered and spoke of stuart general lee said in a low voice i can scarcely think of him without weeping the command of the cavalry devolved upon general hampton and it was fought throughout the succeeding campaign with the nerve and efficiency of a great soldier but stuart had as it were formed and moulded it with his own hands he was the first great commander of horse in the war and it was hard for his successors however great their genius to compete with his memory his name will thus remain that of the greatest and most prominent * of the war crossing the pamunkey at hanovertown after a rapid * general grant sent out a force toward hanover courthouse to cut off lees retreat or discover his position this resulted in nothing since general lee had not moved in that direction he had as soon as the movement of general grant was discovered put his lines in motion directed his march across the country on the direct route to cold harbor and halting behind the * had formed his line there to check the progress of his adversary on the main road from hanovertown toward richmond for the third time thus general grant had found his adversary in his path and no generalship or rapidity in the movement of his column seemed sufficient to secure to him the advantages of a surprise on each occasion the march of the federal army had taken place in the night from the wilderness on the night of may 7th from spottsylvania on the night of may 21st and from near the north anna on the night of may 26th lee had imitated these movements of his opponent interposing on each occasion at the critical moment in his path and inviting battle this last statement may be regarded as too strongly expressed as it seems the opinion of northern writers that lee in these movements aimed only to maintain a strict defensive and by means of breastworks simply keep his adversary at arms length this is an entire mistake confident of the efficiency of his army small as it was he was always desirous to bring on a decisive action under favorable circumstances general early bears his testimony to the truth of this statement i happen to know says this officer that general lee had always the greatest anxiety to strike at grant in the open field during the whole movement from the wilderness to cold harbor the confederate commander was in excellent spirits when at hanover junction he spoke of the situation almost * and said to the venerable dr * speaking of general grant if i can get one more pull at him i will defeat him this expression does not seem to indicate any depression or want of confidence in his ability to meet general grant in an open pitched battle it may however be asked why if such were his desire he did not come out from behind his breastworks and fight the reply is that general grant invariably defended his lines by breastworks as powerful * many cases much more powerful * adversarys the opposing mounds of earth and trees along the routes of the two armies remain to prove the truth of what is here stated at cold harbor especially the federal works are veritable forts in face of them the theory that general grant uniformly acted upon the offensive without fear of offensive operations in turn on the part of lee will be found untenable nor is this statement made with the view of representing general grant as * or of * from his merit as a commander it was on the contrary highly honorable to him that opposed to an adversary of such ability he should have neglected nothing reaching the * general grant found his opponent in a strong position behind that sluggish watercourse prepared to dispute the road to richmond and it now became necessary to force the passage in his front or by another flank march move still farther to the left and endeavor to cross the chickahominy somewhere in the vicinity of cold harbor this last operation was determined upon by general grant and sending his cavalry toward cold harbor he moved rapidly in the same direction with his infantry this movement was discovered at once by lee he sent longstreets corps forward and when the federal army arrived the southern forces were drawn up in their front between them and richmond thus barring for the fourth time in the campaign the road to the capital during these movements nearly continuous fighting had taken place between the opposing columns which clung to each other as it were each shaping its march more or less by that of the other at last they had reached the ground upon which the obstinate struggle of june 1862 had taken place and it now became necessary for general grant either to form some new plan of campaign or by throwing his whole army in one great mass against his adversary break through all obstacles cross the chickahominy and seize upon richmond this was now resolved upon heavy fighting took place on june 2d near * church and at other points while the armies were coming into position but this was felt to be but the preface to the greater struggle which general lee now clearly divined it came without loss of time on the morning of the 3d of june soon after daylight general grant threw his whole army straightforward against lees * along his line the conflict which followed was one of those bloody * rather than battles which * all manoeuvring or * in the commanders depend for the result upon the brute strength of the forces engaged the action did not last half an hour and in that time the federal loss was thirteen thousand men when general lee sent a messenger to ap hill asking the result of the assault on his part of the line hill took the officer with him in front of his works and pointing to the dead bodies which were literally lying upon each other said tell general lee it is the same all along my front the federal army had indeed sustained a blow so heavy that even the constant mind and fixed resolution of general grant and the federal authorities seem to have been shaken the war seemed hopeless to many persons in the north after the frightful bloodshed of this thirty minutes at cold harbor of which fact there is sufficient proof so gloomy says a northern historian was the military outlook after the action on the chickahominy and to such a degree by consequence had the moral spring of the public mind become relaxed that there was at this time great danger of a collapse of the war the history of this conflict truthfully written will show this the archives of the state department when one day made public will show how deeply the government was affected by the want of military success and to what resolutions the executive had in consequence come had not success elsewhere come to brighten the horizon it would have been difficult to have raised new forces to recruit the army of the potomac which shaken in its structure its valor * in blood and thousands of its ablest officers killed and wounded was the army of the potomac no more the campaign of one * may 4th to june #* cost the federal commander sixty thousand men and three thousand * which are given on the authority of federal * the loss of lee did not exceed eighteen thousand the result would seem an unfavorable comment upon the choice of the route across the country from culpepper instead of that by the james general mcclellan two years before had reached cold harbor with trifling losses to attain the same point had cost general grant a frightful number of lives nor could it be said that he had any important successes to offset this loss he had not defeated his adversary in any of the battlefields of the campaign nor did it seem that he had stricken him any serious blow the army of northern virginia not renforced until it reached hanover junction and then only by about nine thousand men under generals breckinridge and pickett had held its ground against the large force opposed to it had repulsed every assault and in a final trial of strength with a force largely its superior had inflicted upon the enemy in about an hour a loss of thirteen thousand men these facts highly honorable to lee and his troops are the plainest and most * comment we can make upon the campaign the whole movement of general grant across virginia is indeed now conceded even by his admirers to have been unfortunate it failed to accomplish the end expected from itthe investment of richmond on the north and * the lives of about sixty thousand men were it would seem unnecessarily lost to reach a position which might have been attained with losses comparatively trifling and without the unfortunate prestige of defeat general lee remained facing his adversary in his lines at cold harbor for many days after the bloody struggle of the 3d of june confident of his ability to repulse any new attack and completely barring the way to richmond the federal campaign it was now seen was at an end on that line and it was obvious that general grant must adopt some other plan in spite of his determination expressed in the beginning of the campaign to fight it out on that line if it took all the summer the summer was but begun and further fighting on that line was hopeless under these circumstances the federal commander resolved to give up the attempt to assail richmond from the north or east and by a rapid movement to petersburg seize upon that place cut the confederate railroads leading southward and thus compel an evacuation of the capital it would be interesting to inquire what the course of general lee would have been in the event of the success of this plan and how the war would have resulted it would seem that under such circumstances his only resource would have been to retire with his army in the direction of lynchburg where his communications would have remained open with the south and west if driven from that point the fastnesses of the alleghanies were at hand and contemplating afterward the possibility of being forced to take refuge there he said with my army in the mountains of virginia i could carry on this war for twenty years longer that spectacle was lost to the * and his army fighting from mountain * to mountain * the annals of war are not illustrated by a chapter so strange that lee was confident of his ability to carry on such a struggle successfully is certain and washington had conceived the same idea in the old revolution when he said that if he were driven from the seaboard he would take refuge in west augusta and thereby prolong the war * to return from these speculations to the narrative of events general grant remained in front of lee until the 12th of june when moving again by his left flank he crossed the chickahominy proceeded in the direction of city point at which place the appomattox and james rivers mingle their waters and crossing the james on pontoons hastened forward in order to seize upon petersburg this important undertaking had been strangely neglected by majorgeneral butler who in obedience to general grants orders had sailed from fortress monroe on the 4th of may reached bermuda hundred the peninsula opposite city point made by a remarkable bend in james river and proceeded to intrench himself it was in his power on his arrival to have seized upon petersburg but this he failed to do at that time and the appearance of a force under general beauregard from the south soon induced him to give his entire attention to his own safety an attack by beauregard had been promptly made which nearly resulted in general butlers destruction he succeeded however in retiring behind his works across the neck of the peninsula in which he now found himself completely shut up and so powerless was his situation with his large force of thirty thousand men that general grant wrote his army was as completely shut off as if it had been in a bottle strongly * the attempt of general grant to seize upon petersburg by a surprise failed his forces were not able to reach the vicinity of the place until the 15th when they were bravely opposed behind impromptu works by a body of local troops who fought like regular soldiers and succeeded in holding the works until night ended the contest when morning came long lines were seen defiling into the breastworks and the familiar battleflags of the army of northern virginia rose above the long line of bayonets giving assurance that the possession of petersburg would be obstinately disputed general lee had moved with his accustomed celerity and as usual without that loss of time which results from doubt of an adversarys intentions if general grant retired without another battle on the chickahominy it was obvious to lee that he must design one of two things either to advance upon richmond from the direction of charles city or attempt a campaign against the capital from the south of james river lee seems at once to have satisfied himself that the latter was the design an inconsiderable force was sent to feel the enemy near the whiteoak swamp he was encountered there in some force but satisfied that this was a feint to * him general lee proceeded to cross the james river above drurys bluff near * and concentrate his army at petersburg on the 16th he was in face of his adversary there general grant had adopted the plan of campaign which lee expected him to adopt general mcclellan had not been permitted in 1862 to carry out the same plan it was now undertaken by general grant who sustained better relations toward the government and the result would seem to indicate that general mcclellan was after all a soldier of sound views as soon as general lee reached petersburg he began promptly to draw a regular line of earthworks around the city to the east and south for its defence it was obvious that general grant would lose no time in striking at him in order to take advantage of the slight character of the defences already existing and this anticipation was speedily realized general lee had scarcely gotten his forces in position on the 16th when he was furiously attacked and such was the weight of this assault that lee was forced from his advanced position east of the city behind his second line of works by this time well forward in process of construction against this new line general grant threw heavy forces in attack after attack on the 17th and 18th losing it is said more than four thousand men but effecting nothing on the 21st general lee was called upon to meet a more formidable assault than any of the preceding * time more to his right in the vicinity of the weldon railroad which runs southward from petersburg a heavy line was advanced in that quarter by the enemy but observing that an interval had been left between two of their corps general lee threw forward a column under general hill cut the federal lines and repulsed their attack bearing off nearly three thousand prisoners on the same night an important cavalry expedition consisting of the divisions of general wilson and * numbering about six thousand horse was sent westward to cut the weldon southside and danville railroads which connected the southern army with the south and west this raid resulted in apparently great but really unimportant injury to the confederate communications against which it was directed the federal cavalry tore up large portions of the tracks of all three railroads burning the woodwork and laying waste the country around but the further results of the expedition were unfavorable they were pursued and harassed by a small body of cavalry under general w hf lee and on their return in the direction of reamss station were met near * church by a force of fifteen hundred cavalry under general hampton that energetic officer at once attacked the fighting continued furiously throughout the entire night and at dawn the federal horse retreated in confusion their misfortunes were not however ended near reamss at which point they attempted to cross the weldon railroad they were met by general fitz lees horsemen and about two hundred infantry under general mahone and this force completed their discomfiture after a brief attempt to force their way through the unforeseen obstacle they broke in disorder leaving behind them twelve pieces of artillery and more than a thousand prisoners and with foaming and exhausted horses regained the federal lines such was the result of an expedition from which general grant probably expected much the damage done to lees communications was inconsiderable and did not repay the federal commander for the losses sustained the railroads were soon repaired and in working order again and the federal cavalry was for the time rendered unfit for further operations it was now the end of june and every attempt made by general grant to force lees lines had proved unsuccessful it was apparent that surprise of the able commander of the confederate army was hopeless his works were growing stronger every day and nothing was left to his great adversary but to lay regular siege to the long line of fortifications to draw lines for the protection of his own front from attack and by gradually extending his left reach out toward the weldon and southside railroads to obtain possession of these roads was from this time general grants great object and all his movements were shaped by that paramount consideration the first days of july 1864 witnessed at petersburg the commencement of a series of military manoeuvres for which few if any precedents existed in all the annals of war an army of forty or fifty thousand men intrenched along a line extending finally over a distance of nearly forty miles was defending against a force of about thrice its numbers a capital more than twenty miles in its rear and from july of one year to april of the next there never was a moment when to have broken through this line would not have terminated the war and resulted in the destruction of the confederacy a few words in reference to the * of the country and the situation will show this petersburg is twentytwo miles south of richmond and is connected with the south and west by the weldon and southside railroads which latter road crosses the danville railroad the main line of communication between the capital and the gulf states with the enemy once holding these roads and those north of the city as they were preparing to do the capital would be isolated and the confederate government must evacuate virginia in that event the army of northern virginia had also nothing left to it but retreat virginia must be abandoned the federal authority would be extended over the oldest and one of the largest and most important members of the confederacy and under circumstances so adverse it might well be a question whether disheartened as they would be by the loss of so powerful an ally the other states of the confederacy would have sufficient resolution to continue the contest these considerations are said to have been fully weighed by general lee whose farreaching military sagacity divined the exact situation of affairs and the probable results of a conflict so unequal as that which general grant now forced upon him we have noticed on a preceding page his opinions upon this subject expressed to a confidential friend as far back as 1862 he then declared that the true line of assault upon richmond was that now adopted by general grant as long as the capital was assailed from the north or the east he might hope with some reason by hard fighting to repulse the assault and hold richmond but with an enemy at petersburg threatening with a large force the southern railroads it was obviously only a question of time when richmond and consequently virginia must be abandoned general lee we repeat fully realized the facts here stated when his adversary giving up all other lines crossed james river to petersburg lee is said we know not with what truth to have coolly recommended an evacuation of richmond but this met with no favor a powerful party including both the friends and enemies of the executive spoke of the movement as a pernicious idea if recommended by lee it was speedily abandoned and all the energies of the government were concentrated upon the difficult task of holding the enemy at arms length south of the appomattox and in charles city in a few weeks after the appearance of the adversaries opposite each other at petersburg the lines of * and defence were drawn and the long struggle began general grant had crossed a force into charles city on the north bank of james river and thus menaced richmond with an assault from that quarter his line extended thence across the neck of the peninsula of bermuda hundred and east and south of petersburg where day by day it gradually reached westward approaching nearer and nearer to the railroads feeding the southern army and capital lees line conformed itself to that of his adversary in addition to the works east and southeast of richmond an exterior chain of defences had been drawn facing the hostile force near deep bottom and the river at drurys bluff a fortification of some strength had been guarded by sunken obstructions against the approach of the federal gunboats the southern lines then continued facing those of the enemy north of the appomattox and crossing that stream extended around the city of petersburg gradually moving westward in conformity with the works of general grant a glance at the accompanying diagram will clearly indicate the positions and relations to each other of the federal and confederate works these will show that the real struggle was anticipated by both commanders west of petersburg and as the days wore on it was more and more apparent that somewhere in the vicinity of dinwiddie courthouse the last great wrestle of the opposing armies must take place to that conclusive trial of strength we shall advance with as few interruptions as possible the operations of the two armies at petersburg do not possess for the general reader that dramatic interest which is found in battles such as those of chancellorsville and gettysburg deciding for the time the fates of great campaigns at petersburg the fighting seemed to decide little and the bloody collisions had no names the day of pitched battles indeed seemed past it was one long battle day and night week after week and month after * the heat of summer the sad hours of autumn and the cold days and nights of winter it was in fact the siege of richmond which general grant had undertaken and the fighting consisted less of battles in the ordinary acceptation of that word than of attempts to break through the lines of his * north of james river now east of petersburg now at some point in the long chain of * which guarded the approaches to the coveted southside railroad which once in possession of the federal commander would give him victory of this long obstinate and bloody struggle we shall describe only those prominent incidents which rose above the rest with a species of dramatic splendor for the full narrative the reader must have recourse to military histories aiming to chronicle the operations of each corps division and brigade in the two * minuteness of detail beyond our scope and probably not desired by those who will peruse these pages the month of july began and went upon its way with incessant fighting all along the confederate front both north of james river and south of the appomattox general grant was thus engaged in the persistent effort to at some point break through his opponents works when intelligence suddenly reached him by telegraph from washington that a strong confederate column had advanced down the shenandoah valley crossed the potomac and was rapidly moving eastward in the direction of the federal capital this portentous incident was the result of a plan of great boldness devised by general lee from which he expected much a few words will explain this plan a portion of general grants plan of campaign had been an advance up the valley and another from western virginia toward the lynchburg and tennessee * two columns to coperate with the main army by cutting the confederate communications the column in western virginia effected little but that in the valley under general hunter hastened forward almost * from the small numbers of the southern force and early in june threatened lynchburg the news reached lee at cold harbor soon after his battle there with general grant and he promptly detached general early at the head of about eight thousand men with orders to move to the valley through * gap or browns gap attack hunter and then cross the potomac and threaten washington general early an officer of great energy and intrepidity moved without loss of time and an engagement ensued between him and general hunter near lynchburg the battle was soon decided general hunter who had more cruelly oppressed the inhabitants of the valley than even general milroy was completely defeated driven in disordered flight toward the ohio and early hastened down the valley and thence into maryland with the view of threatening washington as he had been ordered to do by lee his march was exceedingly rapid and he found the road * until he reached the monocacy near frederick city where he was opposed by a force under general wallace this force he attacked and soon drove from the field he then pressed forward and on the 11th of july came in sight of washington it was the intelligence of this advance of a confederate force into maryland and toward the capital which came to startle general grant while he was hotly engaged with lee at petersburg the washington authorities seem to have been completely unnerved and to have regarded the capture of the city as nearly inevitable general grant however stood firm and did not permit the terror of the civil authorities to affect him he sent forward to washington two army corps and these arrived just in time if it had been in the power of general early to capture * seems * opportunity was lost he found himself compelled to retire across the potomac again to avoid an attack in his rear and this he effected without loss taking up in accordance with orders from lee a position in the valley where he remained for some months a standing threat to the enemy such was the famous march of general early to washington and there seems at present little reason to doubt that the federal capital had a narrow escape from capture by the confederates what the result of so singular an event would have been it is difficult to say but it is certain that it would have put an end to general grants entire campaign at petersburg * speculations of this character are simply loss of time the city was not captured the war went upon its way and was destined to terminate by pure exhaustion of one of the combatants unaffected by * de main in any part of the theatre of conflict we have briefly spoken of the engagement between generals early and hunter near lynchburg and the abrupt retreat of the latter to the western mountains and thence toward the ohio it may interest the reader to know general lees views on the subject of this retreat which it seems were drawn from him by a letter addressed to him by general hunter general lee wrote a very courteous reply in which he said lees opinion of the military abilities of both generals hunter and sheridan was indeed far from flattering he regarded those two * general * enjoying * solely conferred upon them by the exhaustion of the resources of the confederacy and not warranted by any military efficiency in themselves the end of the month of july was now approaching and every attempt made by general grant to break through lees lines had resulted in failure at every point which he assailed an armed force sufficient to repulse his most vigorous attacks seemed to spring from the earth and no movement of the federal forces however sudden and rapid had been able to take the confederate commander unawares the campaign was apparently settling down into stubborn fighting day and night in which the object of general grant was to carry out his programme of attrition such was the feeling in both armies when at dawn on the 30th of july a loud explosion heard for thirty miles took place on the lines near petersburg and a vast column of smoke shooting upward to a great height seemed to indicate the blowing up of an extensive magazine instead of a magazine it was a mine which had thus been exploded and the incident was not the least singular of a campaign unlike any which had preceded it the plan of forming a breach in the southern works by exploding a mine beneath them is said by northern writers to have originated with a subordinate officer of the federal army who observing the close proximity of the opposing works near petersburg conceived it feasible to construct a subterranean gallery reaching beneath those of general lee the undertaking was begun the earth being carried off in * and such was the steady persistence of the workmen that a gallery five hundred feet long with lateral openings beneath the confederate works was soon finished and in these lateral recesses was placed a large amount of powder all was now ready and the question was how to utilize the explosion general grant decided to follow it by a sudden charge through the breach seize a crest in rear and thus interpose a force directly in the centre of lees line a singular discussion however arose and caused some embarrassment should the assaulting column consist of white or negro troops this question was decided general grant afterward declared by pulling * or tossing * white troops were the fortunate or unfortunate * on the morning of july 30th the mine was exploded the effect was frightful and the incident will long be remembered by those present and escaping unharmed the small southern force and artillery immediately above the mine were hurled into the air an opening one hundred and fifty feet long sixty feet wide and thirty feet deep suddenly appeared where a moment before had extended the confederate earthworks and the federal division selected for the charge rushed forward to pierce the opening the result did not justify the sanguine expectations which seem to have been excited in the breasts of the federal officers a southern writer thus describes what ensued the white division charged reached the crater stumbled over the dbris were suddenly met by a merciless fire of artillery enfilading them right and left and of infantry * them in front faltered hesitated were badly led lost heart gave up the plan of seizing the crest in rear huddled into the crater man on top of man company mingled with company and upon this disordered unstrung quivering mass of human beings white and * the black troops had * poured a hurricane of shot shell canister musketry which made the hideous crater a * horrible and frightful beyond the power of words all order was lost all idea of charging the crest abandoned lees infantry was seen concentrating for the carnival of death his artillery was massing to destroy the remnants of the charging divisions those who deserted the crater to scramble over the dbris and run back were shot down then all that was left to the shuddering mass of blacks and whites in the pit was to shrink lower evade the horrible * and wait for a charge of their friends to rescue them or surrender these sentences sufficiently describe the painful scene which followed the explosion of the mine the charging column was unable to advance in face of the very heavy fire directed upon them by the southern infantry and artillery and the effect of this fire was so appalling that general mahone commanding at the spot is said to have ordered it to cease adding that the spectacle made him sick the federal forces finally succeeded in making their way back with a loss of about four thousand prisoners and general lee whose losses had been small * his line without interruption before passing from this incident a singular circumstance connected with it is deserving of mention this was the declaration of the congressional committee which in due time investigated the whole affair the conclusion of the committee was not flattering to the veteran army of the potomac the report declared that the first and great cause of disaster was the employment of white instead of black troops to make the charge throughout the months of august and september lee continued to be attacked at various points along his entire front but succeeded in repulsing every assault general grants design may be said in general terms to have been a steady extension of his left toward the confederate communications west of petersburg while taking the chances by attacks north of james river to break through in that quarter and seize upon richmond it is probable that his hopes of effecting the * object were small but operations in that direction promised the more probable result of causing lee to weaken his right and thus uncover the southside railroad an indecisive attack on the north of james river was followed toward the end of august by a heavy advance to seize upon the weldon railroad near petersburg in this general grant succeeded an event clearly foreseen by lee who had long before informed the authorities that he could not hold this road general grant followed up this success by sending heavy forces to seize reamss station on the same road farther south and afterward to destroy it to * however effected less favorable results lee meeting and defeating both forces after obstinate engagements in which the federal troops lost heavily and were compelled to retreat these varying successes did not however materially affect the general result the federal left gradually reached farther and farther westward until finally it had passed the * squirrel level and other roads running * from petersburg and in october was established on the left bank of hatchers run which unites with * run to form the rowanty it was now obvious that a further extension of the federal left would probably enable general grant to seize upon the southside railroad an energetic attempt was speedily made by him to effect this important object to which it is said he attached great importance from its anticipated bearing on the approaching presidential election on the 27th of october a heavy column was thrown across hatchers run in the vicinity of burgesss mill on the boydton road and an obstinate attack was made on lees lines there with the view of breaking through to the southside road in this however general grant did not succeed his column was met in front and flank by generals * here lost his brave son * whf lee with dismounted sharpshooters infantry was hastened to the threatened point by general lee and after an obstinate struggle the federal force was driven back general lee reporting that general mahone charged and broke three lines of battle with this repulse of the federal forces terminated active operations of importance for the year and but one other attempt was made during the winter to gain ground on the left this took place early in february and resulted in failure like the * confederates losing however the brave general john pegram the presidential election at the north had been decided in favor of mr * mcclellan and mr pendleton the supposed advocates of peace suffering defeat the significance of this fact was unmistakable it was now seen that unless the confederates fought their way to independence there was no hope of a favorable termination of the war and this conclusion was courageously faced by general lee the outlook for the coming year was far from encouraging the resources of the confederacy were steadily being reduced her coasts were * her armies were diminishing discouragement seemed slowly to be invading every * in the midst of this general foreboding the commander of the army of northern virginia retained an august composure and conversing with one of the southern senators said for myself i intend to die sword in hand that his sense of duty did not afterward permit him to do so was perhaps one of the bitterest pangs of his whole life before entering upon the narrative of the last and decisive campaign of the war we shall speak of the personal demeanor of general lee at this time and endeavor to account for a circumstance which astonished many * surprising equanimity and even cheerfulness under the pressure of cares sufficient it would seem to crush the most powerful organization he had established his headquarters a mile or two west of petersburg on the cox road nearly opposite his centre and here he seemed to await whatever the future would bring with a tranquillity which was a source of surprise and admiration to all who were thrown in contact with him many persons will bear their testimony to this extraordinary composure his countenance seldom if ever exhibited the least traces of anxiety but was firm hopeful and encouraged those around him in the belief that he was still confident of success that he did not however look forward with any thing like hope to such success we have endeavored already to show from the first he seems to have regarded his situation unless his army were largely renforced as almost desperate those renforcements did not come and yet as he saw his numbers day by day * and general grants increasing a still larger ratio he retained his courage confronting the misfortunes closing in upon him with unmoved composure and at no time seemed to lose his heart of hope of this phenomenon the explanation has been sought in the constitutional courage of the individual and that instinctive * against fate which takes place in great organizations this explanation doubtless is not without a certain amount of truth but an attentive consideration of the principles which guided this eminent soldier throughout his career will show that his equanimity at a moment so trying was due to another and more controlling sentiment this sentiment was his devotion to * sublimest word in our language throughout his entire life he had sought to discover and perform his duty without regard to consequences that had been with him the great question in april 1861 when the war broke out he had decided in his own mind what he ought to do and had not hesitated from that time forward he continued to do what duty commanded without a murmur in the obscure campaign of western * the * work of fortifying the southern * the great campaigns which he had subsequently * everywhere his consciousness of having performed his duty to the best of his knowledge and ability sustained him it sustained him above all at gettysburg where he had done his best giving him strength to take upon himself the responsibility of that disaster and now in these last dark days at petersburg it must have been the sense of having done his whole duty and expended upon the cause every energy of his being which enabled him to meet the approaching catastrophe with a calmness which seemed to those around him almost sublime if this be not the explanation of the composure of general lee throughout the last great struggle with the federal army the writer of these pages is at a loss to account for it the phenomenon was plain to all eyes and crowned the soldier with a glory greater than that which he had derived from his most decisive military successes great and unmoved in the dark hour as in the bright he seemed to have determined to perform his duty to the last and to shape his conduct under whatever pressure of disaster upon the two maxims do your duty and human virtue should be equal to human calamity there is little reason to doubt that general lee saw this calamity coming for the effort to renforce his small army with fresh levies seemed hopeless the reasons for this unfortunate state of things must be sought elsewhere the unfortunate fact will be stated without comment that while the federal army was regularly and largely renforced so that its numbers at no time fell below one hundred and fifty thousand men lees entire force at petersburg at no time reached sixty thousand and in the spring of 1865 when he still continued to hold his long line of defences numbered scarcely half of sixty thousand this was the primary cause of the failure of the struggle general grants immense hammer continued to beat upon his adversary wearing away his strength day by day no new troops arrived to take the places of those who had fallen and general lee saw drawing closer and closer the inevitable hour when driven from his works or with the federal army upon his communications he must cut his way southward or surrender a last circumstance in reference to general lees position at this time should be stated the fact that from the autumn of 1864 to the end in the spring of 1865 he was felt by the country and the army to be the sole hope of the confederacy to him alone now all men looked as the deus ex * to extricate them from the dangers surrounding them this sentiment needed no expression in words it was seen in the faces and the very tones of voice of all old men visited him and begged him with faltering voices not to expose himself for if he were killed all would be lost the troops followed him with their eyes or their cheers whenever he appeared feeling a singular sense of confidence from the presence of the grayhaired soldier in his plain uniform and assured that as long as lee led them the cause was safe all classes of the people thus regarded the fate of the confederacy as resting not partially but solely upon the shoulders of lee and although he was not entitled by his rank in the service to direct operations in other quarters than virginia there was a very general desire that the whole conduct of the war everywhere should be intrusted to his hands this was done as will be seen toward the spring of 1865 but it was too late these notices of general lee individually are necessary to a clear comprehension of the concluding incidents of the great conflict it is doubtful if in any other struggle of history the hopes of a people were more entirely wrapped up in a single individual all criticisms of the eminent soldier had long since been silenced and it may indeed be said that something like a superstitious confidence in his fortunes had become widely * it was the general sentiment even when lee himself saw the end surely approaching that all was safe while he remained in command of the army this hallucination must have greatly pained him for no one ever saw more clearly or was less blinded by * confidence lee fully understood and represented to the civil * whom his relations were perfectly friendly and * if his lines were broken at any point the fate of the campaign was sealed feeling this truth of which his military sagacity left him in no doubt he had to bear the further weight of that general confidence which he did not share he did not complain however or in any manner indicate the desperate straits to which he had come he called for fresh troops to supply his losses when they did not arrive he continued to oppose his powerful adversary with the remnant still at his command these were now more like old comrades than mere private soldiers under his orders what was left of the army was its best material the fires of battle had tested the metal and that which emerged from the furnace was gold free from * the men remaining with lee were those whom no peril of the cause in which they were fighting could * or prompt to desert or even temporarily absent themselves from the southern standard and this corps d lite was devoted wholly to their commander for this devotion they certainly had valid reason never had leader exhibited a more systematic unfailing and almost tender care of his troops lee seemed to feel that these veterans in their ragged jackets with their gaunt faces were personal friends of his own who were entitled to his most affectionate exertions for their welfare his calls on the civil authorities in their behalf were unceasing the burden of these demands was that unless his mens wants were attended to the southern cause was lost and it plainly revolted his sense of the fitness of things that men upon whom depended the fate of the south should be shoeless in tatters and forced to * on a quarter of a pound of rancid bacon and a little corn bread when thousands remaining out of the army and dodging the * were well clothed and fed and never heard the whistle of a bullet the men understood this care for them and returned the affectionate solicitude of their commander in full he was now their ideal of a leader and all that he did was perfect in their eyes all awe of him had long since left * understood what treasures of kindness and simplicity lay under the grave exterior the tattered privates approached the commanderinchief without embarrassment and his reception of them was such as to make them love him more than ever had we space we might dwell upon this marked respect and attention paid by general lee to his private soldiers he seemed to think them more worthy of marks of regard than his highest officers and there was never the least air of condescension in him when thrown with them but a perfect simplicity kindness and unaffected sympathy which went to their hearts this was almost a natural gift with lee and arose from the genuine goodness of his heart his feeling toward his soldiers is shown in an incident which occurred at this time and was thus related in one of the richmond journals a gentleman who was in the train from this city to petersburg a very cold morning not long ago tells us his attention was attracted by the efforts of a young soldier with his arm in a sling to get his overcoat on his teeth as well as his sound arm were brought into use to effect the object but in the midst of his efforts an officer rose from his seat advanced to him and very carefully and tenderly assisted him drawing the coat gently over his wounded arm and * it up comfortably then with a few kind and pleasant words returning to his seat now the officer in question was not clad in gorgeous uniform with a brilliant wreath upon his collar and a multitude of gilt lines upon the sleeves resembling the famous * of crete but he was clad in a simple suit of gray distinguished from the garb of a civilian only by the three stars which every confederate colonel in the service by the regulations is entitled to wear and yet he was no other than our chief general robert e lee who is not braver than he is good and modest to terminate this brief sketch of general lee personally in the winter of 1864 he looked much older than at the beginning of the war but by no means less hardy or robust on the contrary the arduous campaigns through which he had passed seemed to have hardened * to the highest degree the native strength of his physical organization his cheeks were ruddy and his eye had that clear light which indicates the presence of the calm * will but his hair had grown gray like his beard and mustache which were worn short and * his dress as always was a plain and serviceable gray uniform with no indications of rank save the stars on the collar * reached nearly to his knees and he seldom wore any weapon a * * hat rested low upon the forehead and the movements of this soldierly figure were as firm measured and imposing as ever it was impossible to discern in general lee any evidences of impaired strength or any trace of the wearing hardships through which he had passed he seemed made of iron and would remain in his saddle all day and then at his desk half the night without apparently feeling any fatigue he was still almost an * in his personal habits and lived so poorly that it is said he was compelled to borrow a small piece of meat when unexpected visitors dined with him such in brief outline was the individual upon whose shoulders in the last months of 1864 and the early part of 1865 rested the southern confederacy in approaching the narrative of the last tragic scenes of the confederate struggle the writer of these pages experiences emotions of sadness which will probably be shared by not a few even of those readers whose sympathies from the nature of things were on the side of the north to doubt this would be painful and would indicate a contempt for human nature not only in the eyes of his friends and followers but even in the eyes of his bitterest enemies lee must surely have appeared great and noble right or wrong in the struggle he believed that he was performing his duty and the brave army at his back which had fought so heroically were inspired by the same sentiment and risked all on the issue this great soldier was now about to suffer the * pang which the spite of fate can inflict and his army to be disbanded to return in poverty and defeat to their homes that spectacle was surely tragic and appealed to the hardest heart and if any rejoiced in such misery he must have been * of the sentiment of admiration for heroism in misfortune the last and decisive struggle between the two armies at petersburg began in march 1865 but events of great importance in many quarters had preceded this final conflict the result of which had been to break down all the outer defences of the confederacy leaving only the inner citadel still intact the events in question are so familiar to those who will peruse these pages that a passing reference to them is all that is necessary affairs in the valley of virginia from autumn to spring had steadily proceeded from bad to worse in september general sheridan with a force of about fortyfive thousand had assailed general early near winchester with a force of about eight or nine thousand muskets and succeeded in driving him up the valley beyond strasburg whence attacked a second time he had retreated toward staunton this was followed in october by another battle at cedar run where early attacked and nearly crushed general sheridan but eventually was again repulsed and forced a second time to retreat up the valley to waynesboro where in february his little remnant was assailed by overwhelming numbers and dispersed general sheridan who had effected this inglorious but important success then proceeded to the * joined general grants army and was ready with his large force of horse to take part in the coming battles a more important success had attended the federal arms in the west general johnston who had been restored to command there at the solicitation of lee had found his force insufficient to oppose general shermans large army the confederates had accordingly retreated and general sherman almost * from the exhaustion of his adversary marched across the country to savannah which fell an easy prize and thence advanced to goldsborough in north carolina where he directly threatened lees line of retreat from virginia such was the condition of affairs in the months of february and march 1865 in the former month commissioners from the confederate government had met president lincoln in hampton roads but no terms of peace could be agreed upon the issue was still left to be decided by arms and every advantage was upon the federal side general lee who had just been appointed * thus imposed upon him the mockery of a rank no longer of any * the armies of the enemy closing in upon him and did not deceive himself with the empty hope that he could longer hold his lines at petersburg the country oppressed as it was and laboring under a sentiment akin to despair still retained in almost undiminished measure its superstitious confidence in him but he himself saw clearly the desperate character of the situation general grant was in his front with a force of about one hundred and fifty thousand men and general sherman was about to enter virginia with an army of about the same numbers lees force at petersburg was a little over thirty thousand * of johnston was not so great and was detained by sherman under these circumstances it was obviously only a question of time when the army of northern virginia would be overwhelmed in february 1865 these facts were perfectly apparent to general lee but one course was left to * retreat from virginia and he promptly began that movement in the latter part of the month ordering his trains to amelia courthouse and directing pontoons to be got ready at roanoke river his aim was * unite his army with that of general johnston and retreat into the gulf states in the mountains of virginia he could carry on the war he had said for twenty years in the fertile regions of the south he might expect to prolong hostilities or at least make favorable terms of * would be better than to remain in virginia until he was completely surrounded and an unconditional submission would alone be left him it will probably remain a subject of regret to military students that lee was not permitted to carry out this retreat into the gulf states the movement was arrested after a consultation with the civil authorities at richmond upon what grounds a course so obviously necessary was opposed the present writer is unable to declare whatever the considerations lee yielded his judgment the movement suddenly stopped and the army of northern * a skeleton can be called * to await its fate the condition of the army in which companies scarce existed regiments were counted by tens and divisions by hundreds only need not here be elaborately dwelt upon it was indeed the phantom of an army and the gaunt faces were almost ghostly shoeless in rags with just sufficient coarse food to sustain life but never enough to keep at armslength the gnawing fiend hunger lees old veterans remained firm scattered like a thin skirmishline along forty miles of works while opposite them lay an enemy in the highest state of efficiency and numbering nearly five men to their one that the soldiers of the army retained their nerve under circumstances so discouraging is surely an honorable fact and will make their names glorious in history they remained unshaken and fought undismayed to the last although their courage was subjected to trials of the most exhausting character day and night for month after month the incessant fire of the federal forces had continued and every engine of human destruction had been put in play to wear away their strength they fought all through the cheerless days of winter and when they lay down in the cold trenches at night the shell of the federal * rained down upon them bursting and mortally wounding them all day long the fire of muskets and * from sunset to dawn the curving fire of the roaring * and the steady * crack of the sharpshooters along the front snow or blinding sleet or freezing rains might be falling but the fire went * seemed destined to go on to all eternity in march 1865 however the end was approaching and general lee must have felt that all was lost his last hope had been the retreat southward in the month of february that hope had been taken from him the result was at hand and his private correspondence if he intrusted to paper his views of the situation will probably show that from that moment he gave up all anticipation of success and prepared to do his simple duty as a soldier leaving the issue of affairs to providence whatever may have been his emotions they were not reflected in his countenance the same august composure which had accompanied him in his previous campaigns remained with him still and cheered the fainting hearts around him to the 2d of april and even up to the end this remarkable calmness continued nearly unchanged and we can offer no explanation of a circumstance so astonishing save that which we have already given in a preceding chapter general lee became aware as the end of march drew near that preparations were being made in the federal army for some important movement what that movement would be there was little reason to doubt the federal lines had been extended gradually toward the southside railroad and it was obvious now that general grant had in view a last and decisive advance in that quarter which should place him on his opponents communications and completely intercept his retreat southward the catastrophe which general lee had plainly foreseen for many months now stared him in the face and unless he had recourse to some expedient as desperate as the situation the end of the struggle must soon come the sole course left to him was retreat but this now seemed difficult if not impossible general grant had a powerful force not far from the main roads over which lee must move and unless a diversion of some description were made it seemed barely possible that the southern army could extricate itself this diversion general lee now proceeded to make and although we have no authority to state that his object was to follow up the blow if it were successful by an evacuation of his lines at petersburg it is difficult to conceive what other design he could have had in risking an operation so critical he had resolved to throw a column against the federal centre east of petersburg with the view to break through there and seize the commanding ground in rear of the line he would thus be rooted in the middle of general grants army and the federal left would probably be recalled leaving the way open if he designed to retreat if he designed however to fight a last pitched battle which should decide all he would be able to do so in case the federal works were broken to greater advantage than under any other circumstances the point fixed upon was fort steadman near the south bank of the appomattox where the opposing works were scarcely two hundred yards from each other the ground in front was covered with abatis and otherwise obstructed but it was hoped that the assaulting column would be able to pass over the distance undiscovered in that event a sudden rush would probably carry the * large part of the army would * hill beyond would be * general grant would be compelled to concentrate his army at the point for his own protection on the morning of march 25th before dawn the column was ready it consisted of three or four thousand men under general gordon but an additional force was held in reserve to follow up the attack if it succeeded just as dawn appeared gordon put his column in motion it advanced silently over the intervening space made a rush for the federal works mounted them drove from them in great confusion the force occupying them and a loud cheer proved that the column of gordon had done its work but this * beginning was the only success achieved by the confederates for reasons unknown to the present writer the force directed by lee to be held in readiness and to move at once to gordons support did not go forward the brave commander and his men were left to breast the whole weight of the federal onslaught which ensued and disaster followed the first great success the forts to the right and left of fort steadman suddenly opened their thunders and something like a repetition of the scene succeeding the mine explosion ensued a considerable portion of the assaulting column was unable to get back and fell into the enemys hands their works were quickly reoccupied and lee saw that his last hope had failed nothing was left to him now but such courageous resistance as it was in his power to make and he prepared with the worn weapon which he still held in his firm grasp to oppose as he best could the immense * use general grants own * was plainly about to be raised to strike the hour of the final struggle now rapidly drew near on the 29th of march general lee discovered that a large portion of the federal army was moving steadily in the direction of his works beyond * mill and there could be no doubt what this movement signified general grant was plainly about to make a decisive attack on the confederate right on the whiteoak road and if that attack succeeded lee was lost had not general lee and his men become accustomed to retain their coolness under almost any circumstances of trial the prospect now before them must have filled them with despair the bulk of the federal army was obviously about to be thrown against the confederate right and it was no secret in the little body of southerners that lee would be able to send thither only a painfully inadequate force unless his extensive works were left in charge of a mere line of skirmishers this could not be thought of the struggle on the right must be a desperate one and the southern troops must depend upon hard fighting rather than numbers if they hoped to repulse the attack of the enemy such was the situation of affairs and neither the confederate commander nor his men shrunk in the hour of trial leaving longstreet to confront the enemy north of the james and gordon in command of ewells * it could be called * front of petersburg lee moved with nearly the whole remainder of his small force westward beyond hatchers run to meet the anticipated attack the force thus moved to the right to receive general grants great assault consisted of about fifteen thousand infantry and about two thousand cavalry under general fitz lee who in consequence of the departure of hampton to north carolina now commanded the cavalry of the army this force however was cavalry only in name and general lee speaking afterward of general sheridan said that his victories were won when we had no horses for our cavalry and no men to ride the few brokendown steeds that we could muster with this force amounting in all to about seventeen thousand men lee proceeded to take position behind the works extending along the whiteoak road in the direction of five forks an important * beyond his extreme right the number of men left north of james river and in front of petersburg was a little under twenty thousand as general grant had at his command a force about four times as great as his adversarys it seemed scarcely possible that lee would be able to offer serious resistance it soon became evident however that in spite of this great disproportion of force general lee had determined to fight to the last to attribute this determination to despair and recklessness would be doing injustice to the great soldier it was still possible that he might be able to repulse the assault upon his right and by * the federal force there open his line of retreat to this hope he no doubt clung and the * of his race was now thoroughly aroused at chancellorsville and elsewhere the odds had been nearly as great and a glance at his gaunt veterans showed him that they might still be depended upon for a struggle as obstinate as any in the past history of the war the event certainly vindicated the justice of this latter view and we shall briefly trace the occurrences of the next three or four days which terminated the long conflict at petersburg general grants assaulting force was not in position near the boydton road beyond hatchers run until march 31st when before he could attack lee suddenly advanced and made a furious onslaught on the federal front before this attack the divisions first encountered gave way in confusion and it seemed that the confederate commander at a single blow was about to extricate himself from his embarrassing situation the force opposed to him however was too great and he found himself unable to encounter it in the open field he therefore fell back to his works and the fighting ceased only to be renewed however at five forks this had been seized by the cavalry of general sheridan and as the point was one of importance lee detached a small body of infantry to drive away the federal horse this was done without difficulty and the confederate infantry then advanced toward dinwiddie courthouse but late at night it was withdrawn and the days fighting ended on the next day the 1st of april a more determined struggle ensued for the possession of five forks where lee had stationed the small remnants of the divisions of pickett and johnson these made a brave resistance but were wholly unable to stand before the force brought against them they maintained their ground as long as possible but were finally broken to pieces and scattered in confusion the whole right of the confederate line and the southside road falling into the hands of the enemy this was virtually the end of the contest but general grant it would appear deemed it inexpedient to venture any thing so * manned were the lines in front of petersburg in the absence of longstreet north of james river and the troops sent beyond hatchers run that on the 1st of april the federal commander might have broken through the works at almost any point he elected to wait however until the following day thereby running the risk of * to find that lee had retreated at dawn on the 2d the long struggle ended the federal forces advanced all along the confederate front made a furious attack and breaking through in front of the city carried all before them the forts especially fort gregg made a gallant resistance this work was defended by the two hundred and fifty men of harriss mississippi brigade and these fought until their numbers were reduced to thirty killing or wounding five hundred of the assailants the fort was taken at last and the federal lines advanced toward the city in this attack fell the eminent soldier general ap hill whose record had been so illustrious and whose fortune it was to thus terminate his life while the southern flag still floated any further resistance upon the part of general lee seemed now impossible and nothing appeared to be left him but to surrender his army this course he does not seem however to have contemplated it was still possible that he might be able to maintain his position on an inner line near the city until night and if he could do so the friendly hours of darkness might enable him to make good his retreat to the north bank of the appomattox and shape his course toward north carolina where general johnston awaited him if the movements of the federal forces however were so prompt as to defeat his march in that direction he might still be able to reach lynchburg beyond which point the defiles of the alleghanies promised him protection against the utmost efforts of his enemy of his ability to reach north carolina following the line of the danville railroad lee however seems to have had no doubt the federal army would not probably be able to concentrate in sufficient force in his path to bar his progress if his march were rapid if detached bodies only opposed him on his line of retreat there was little doubt that the army of northern virginia reduced as it was would be able to cut its way through them this preface is necessary to an intelligent comprehension of lees movements on the unfortunate 2d of april when his lines were broken this occurrence took place as we have said about sunrise and an hour or two afterward the federal forces pressed forward all along the line surging toward the suburbs of petersburg we have mentioned the position of general lees headquarters about a mile and a half west of the city on the cox road nearly opposite the tall federal observatory standing on the lawn in front of his headquarters general lee now saw approaching rapidly a heavy column of federal infantry with the obvious design of charging a battery which had opened fire upon them from a hill to the right the spectacle was picturesque and striking across the extensive fields houses set on fire by shell were sending aloft huge clouds of smoke and tongues of flame at every instant was seen the quick glare of the federal artillery firing from every knoll and in front came on the charging column moving at a double quick with burnished gunbarrels and bayonets flashing in the april sunshine general lee watched with attention but with perfect composure this determined advance of the enemy and although he must have realized that his army was on the verge of destruction it was impossible to discern in his features any evidences of emotion he was in full uniform and had buckled on his * which he seldom * on this morning declared it is said that if he were compelled to surrender he would do so in full harness of his calmness at this trying moment the writer is able to bear his personal testimony chancing to hear a question addressed to a member of his staff general lee turned with great courtesy raised his gray hat in response to the writers salute and gave him the desired information in a voice entirely measured and composed it was impossible to regard a calmness so striking without strong sentiments of admiration and lees appearance and bearing at this moment will always remain vividly impressed upon the writers memory the federal column was soon in dangerous proximity to the battery on the hill and it was obliged to retire at a gallop to escape capture an attempt was made to hold the ground near the headquarters but a close * from the enemy rendered this also * artillery was * general lee mounting his irongray slowly rode back accompanied by a number of officers toward his inner line he still remained entirely composed and only said to one of his staff in his habitual tone this is a bad business colonel well colonel he said afterward to another officer it has happened as i told them it would at richmond the line has been stretched until it has broken the federal column was now pressing forward along the cox road toward petersburg and general lee continued to ride slowly back in the direction of the city he was probably recognized by officers of the federal artillery or his cortge drew their fire the group was furiously shelled and one of the shells burst a few feet in rear of him killing the horse of an officer near him cutting the bridlereins of others and tearing up the ground in his immediate vicinity this incident seemed to arouse in general lee his * he turned his head over his right shoulder his cheeks became flushed and a sudden flash of the eye showed with what reluctance he retired before the fire directed upon him no other course was left him however and he continued to ride slowly toward his inner * low earthwork in the suburbs of the * a small force was drawn up ardent hopeful defiant and saluting the shell now bursting above them with cheers and laughter it was plain that the * of the ragged troops remained unbroken and the shout of welcome with which they received lee indicated their unwavering confidence in him despite the untoward condition of affairs arrangements were speedily made to hold the inner line if possible until night to general gordon had been intrusted the important duty of defending the lines east of the city and general longstreet had been directed to vacate the works north of james river and march at once to the lines of petersburg this officer made his appearance with his small force at an early hour of the day and except that the federal army continued firing all along the front no other active operations took place to those present on the confederate side this fact appeared strange as the force beyond hatchers run had been completely defeated and dispersed general lees numbers for the defence of petersburg on this day did not amount to much if any more than fifteen thousand men general grants force was probably one hundred and fifty thousand of whom about one hundred thousand might it would appear have been concentrated in an hour or two directly in front of the city that with this large force at his disposal the federal commander did not at once attack and so end all on that day surprised the confederate troops and still continues to surprise the writer night came at last and general lee began his retreat he had sent early in the morning a dispatch to the civil authorities at richmond informing them of the fact that his lines had been broken and that he would that night retreat from petersburg orders had also been sent to all the forces holding the lines north of james river to move at once and join him and just at nightfall the army at petersburg began crossing the appomattox this movement was effected without interruption from the enemy and the army turning into what is called the hickory road leading up the north bank of the river moved on steadily through the half light its march was superintended by lee in person he had stationed himself at the mouth of the hickory road and standing with the bridle of his horse in his hand gave his orders his bearing still remained entirely composed and his voice had lost none of its grave strength of intonation when the rear was well closed up lee mounted his horse rode on slowly with his men and in the midst of the glare and thunder of the exploding magazines at petersburg the small remnant of the army of northern virginia amounting to about fifteen thousand men went on its way through the darkness on the morning of the 3d of april general lee after allowing his column a brief period of rest continued his march up the north bank of the appomattox the aspect of affairs at this time was threatening and there seemed little ground to hope that the small force would be able to make good its retreat to north carolina general grant had a short and direct route to the danville * considerable portion of his army was already as far west as dinwiddie * it was obvious that he had only to use ordinary diligence to completely cut general lee off in the vicinity of * junction a glance at the map will indicate the advantages possessed by the federal commander he could move over the chord while lee was compelled to follow the arc of the circle unless good fortune assisted lee and ill fortune impeded his opponent the event seemed certain and it will be seen that these conditions were completely reversed under the circumstances here stated it appeared reasonable to expect in lee and his army some depression of spirits the fact was strikingly the reverse the army was in excellent spirits probably from the * contrast of the budding april woods with the * trenches and the * joy of an * march through the fields of spring general lee shared this hopeful feeling in a very remarkable degree his expression was animated and buoyant his seat in the saddle erect and commanding and he seemed to look forward to assured success in the critical movement which he had undertaken i have got my army safe out of its breastworks he said on the morning of this day and in order to follow me the enemy must abandon his lines and can derive no further benefit from his railroads or james river the design of the confederate commander has been already stated but an important condition upon which he depended for success has not been mentioned this was a supply of food for his army the troops during the whole winter had lived from day to day on * doled out to them with a sparing hand and in moving now from petersburg lee saw that he must look to supplies somewhere upon his line of retreat these he had directed to be brought from the south and deposited at amelia courthouse and the expectation of finding at that point full subsistence for his men had doubtless a great effect in * up his spirits an evil chance however reversed all the hopes based on this anticipation from fault or misapprehension the train loaded with supplies proceeded to richmond without depositing the rations at amelia courthouse there was no time to obtain other subsistence and when after unforeseen delay in consequence of high water in the appomattox lee at the head of his halfstarved soldiers reached amelia courthouse it was only to find that there was nothing there for the support of his army and to realize that a successful retreat under the circumstances was wellnigh hopeless those who accompanied the southern army on this arduous march will recall the * expression of the emaciated faces at this unlookedfor calamity and no face wore a heavier shadow than that of general lee the failure of the supply of rations completely paralyzed him he had intended and was confident of his ability to cut his way through the enemy but an army cannot march and fight without food it was now necessary to halt and send out foraging parties into the impoverished region around meanwhile general grant with his great force was rapidly moving to bar his adversarys further advance the want of a few thousand pounds of bread and meat had virtually terminated the war an anxious and haggard expression came to general lees face when he was informed of this great misfortune and at once abandoning his design of cutting his way through to north carolina he turned westward and shaped his march toward lynchburg this movement began on the night of the 5th of april and it would seem that general grant had had it in his power to arrest it by an attack on lee at amelia courthouse general sheridan was in the immediate vicinity with a force of about eighteen thousand * cavalry and although it was not probable that this command could effect any thing against lees army of about the same number of infantry it might still have delayed him by constructing breastworks in his way and thus giving the federal infantry time to come up and attack the opportunity of crushing his adversary at amelia courthouse was thus allowed to pass and general grant now pressed forward his infantry to bring lee to bay if possible before he reached lynchburg from this moment began the struggle between the adversaries which was to continue day and night without * for the next four days the phenomenon was here presented of an army reduced to less than twenty thousand men holding at armslength an enemy numbering about one hundred and fifty thousand and very nearly defeating every effort of the larger force to arrest their march it would not interest the reader probably to follow in minute detail the circumstances of this melancholy retreat from the importance of the transactions and the natural attention directed to them both north and south they are doubtless familiar to all who will read these pages we shall only speak of one or two incidents of the retreat wherein general lee appeared prominent personally leaving to the imagination of the reader the remainder of the long and tragic struggle whose result decided the fate of the confederacy general grant doubtless saw now that every thing depended upon the celerity of his movements and sending in advance his large body of cavalry he hastened forward as rapidly as possible with his infantry bent on interposing if possible a heavy force in his adversarys front lees movements were equally rapid he seemed speedily to have regained his old calmness after the trying disappointment at amelia courthouse and those who shared his counsels at this time can testify that the idea of surrender scarcely entered his mind for a * if it did so was speedily banished under the pressure of circumstances so adverse that they seemed calculated to break down the most stubborn resolution general lee did not falter and throughout the * scenes of the retreat from the moment when he left amelia courthouse to the hour when his little column was drawing near appomattox still continued to believe that the situation was not desperate and that he would be able to force his way through to lynchburg on the evening of the 6th when the army was near farmville a sudden attack was made by the federal cavalry on the trains of the army moving on a parallel road and the small force of infantry guarding them was broken and scattered this occurrence took place while general lee was confronting a body of federal infantry near sailors creek and taking a small brigade he immediately repaired to the scene of danger the spectacle which followed was a very striking and imposing one and is thus described by one who witnessed it the scene was one of gloomy * and tragic interest on a plateau raised above the forest from which they had emerged were the disorganized troops of ewell and anderson gathered in groups * and uttering tumultuous exclamations of rage and defiance rising above the weary groups which had thrown themselves upon the ground were the grim barrels of cannon in battery ready to fire as soon as the enemy appeared in front of all was the still line of battle just placed by lee and waiting calmly general lee had rushed his infantry over just at sunset leading it in person his face animated and his eye brilliant with the soldiers spirit of fight but his bearing * as before an artist desiring to paint his picture ought to have seen the old cavalier at this moment sweeping on upon his large irongray whose mane and tail floated in the wind carrying his fieldglass * in his right hand with head erect gestures animated and in the whole face and form the expression of the hunter close upon his game the line once interposed he rode in the twilight among the disordered groups above mentioned and the sight of him aroused a tumult fierce cries resounded on all sides and with hands clinched violently and raised aloft the men called on him to lead them against the enemy its general lee uncle robert wheres the man who wont follow uncle robert i heard on all * swarthy faces full of dirt and courage lit up every instant by the glare of the burning wagons altogether the scene was indescribable on the 7th the army pressed on beyond farmville still harassed as it advanced by the federal infantry and cavalry but in some of these encounters the pursuing force met with what was probably a very unexpected discomfiture general fitz lee bringing up the rear of the army with his force of about fifteen hundred cavalry on brokendown horses succeeded not only in repulsing the attacks of the large and * force under general sheridan but achieved over them * successes one such incident took place on the 7th when general gregg attacked with about six thousand horse but was met defeated and captured by general fitz lee to the great satisfaction of general lee who said to his son general whf lee keep your command together and in good spirits * let them think of * will get you out of this on the 8th and 9th however this hope seemed unwarranted by the circumstances and the commanderinchief appeared to be almost the only human being who remained sanguine of the result the hardships of the retreat arising chiefly from want of food began to seriously impair the resolution of the troops and the scenes through which they advanced were not calculated to raise their spirits these scenes declares one who witnessed them were of a nature which can be apprehended only by men who are thoroughly familiar with the harrowing details of war behind and on either flank a ubiquitous and increasingly adventurous * * and every rise in the road choked with blazing * air filled with the deafening reports of ammunition exploding and shells bursting when touched by the flames dense columns of smoke ascending to heaven from the burning and exploding vehicles exhausted men wornout mules and horses lying down side by * famine glaring hopelessly from sunken * * mules dead horses dead men * many times welcomed as gods messenger in * can wonder if many hearts tried in the fiery furnace of four unparalleled years and never hitherto found wanting should have quailed in presence of starvation fatigue sleeplessness misery * for five or six days and culminating in hopelessness it cannot however be said with truth that any considerable portion of the southern forces were greatly demoralized to use the military phrase as the fighting of the last two days when the suffering of the retreat culminated will show the men were almost entirely without food and were glad to find a little corn to eat but those who were not physically unable longer to carry their * the number of these latter was * marched and fought with soldierly cheerfulness and resolution general lees spirits do not seem at any time to have * and up to a late period of the retreat he had not seriously contemplated surrender the necessity for this painful course came home to his corps commanders first and they requested general pendleton the efficient chief of artillery of the army to inform general lee that in their opinion further struggle was hopeless general pendleton informed general lee of this opinion of his officers and it seemed to communicate something like a shock to him surrender he exclaimed with a flash of the eye i have too many good fightingmen for that nevertheless the necessity of seriously contemplating this result was soon forced upon him since the morning of the 7th a correspondence had taken place between himself and general grant and as these notes are interesting we here present those which were exchanged up to the night of the 8th no reply was received to this last communication from general lee on the evening of the 8th and that night there was held around a * in the woods the last council of war of the army of northern virginia the scene was a very picturesque one the red glare from the * lit up the group and brought out the details of each figure none were present but general lee and generals longstreet gordon and fitz lee all corps commanders generals gordon and fitz lee half reclined upon an * near the fire longstreet sat upon a log smoking and general lee stood by the fire holding in his hand the correspondence which had passed between himself and general grant the question what course it was advisable to pursue was then presented in a few calm words by general lee to his corps commanders and an informal conversation ensued it was finally agreed that the army should advance on the next morning beyond appomattox courthouse and if only general sheridans cavalry were found in front brush that force from its path and proceed on its way to lynchburg if however the federal infantry was discovered in large force beyond the courthouse the attempt to break through was to be abandoned and a flag dispatched to general grant requested an interview for the arrangement of the terms of a capitulation of the southern army with a heavy heart general lee acquiesced in this plan of proceeding and soon afterward the council of war * corps commanders saluting the commanderinchief who returned their bows with grave courtesy and separating to return to their own bivouacs in spite however of the discouraging and almost desperate condition of affairs general lee seems still to have clung to the hope that he might be able to cut his way through the force in his front he woke from brief slumber beside his * at about three oclock in the morning and calling an officer of his staff colonel venable sent him to general gordon commanding the front to ascertain his opinion at that moment of the probable result of an attack upon the enemy general gordons reply was tell general lee that my old corps is reduced to a * and unless i am supported by longstreet heavily i do not think we can do any thing more general lee received this announcement with an expression of great feeling and after a moments silence said there is nothing left but to go to general grant and i would rather die a thousand deaths his staffofficers had now gathered around him and one of them said what will history say of our * if there is any possibility of escape posterity will not understand it to these words general lee replied yes yes they will not understand our situation but that is not the question the question is whether it is right and if it is right i take the responsibility his expression of buoyant hopefulness had now changed to one of deep melancholy and it was evident to those around him that the thought of surrender was worse to him than the bitterness of death for the first time his courage seemed to give way and he was nearly * turning to an officer standing near him he said his deep voice filled with hopeless sadness how easily i could get rid of this and be at rest i have only to ride along the line and all will be over he was silent for a short time after uttering these words and then added with a heavy sigh but it is our duty to live what will become of the women and children of the south if we are not here to protect them the moment had now come when the fate of the retreat was to be decided to general gordon who had proved himself in the last operations of the war a soldier of the first ability had been intrusted the command of the advance force and this was now moved forward against the enemy beyond appomattox courthouse gordon attacked with his infantry supported by fitz lees cavalry and the artillery battalion of colonel carter and such was the impetuosity of his advance that he drove the federal forces nearly a mile but at that point he found himself in face of a body of infantry stated afterward by federal officers to number about eighty thousand as his own force was less than five thousand muskets he found it impossible to advance farther and the federal lines were already pressing forward to attack him in overwhelming force when the movement suddenly ceased seeing the hopelessness of further resistance general lee had sent a flag to general grant requesting an interview looking to the arrangement if possible of terms of surrender and to this end the forward movement of the federal forces was ordered to be discontinued the two armies then remained facing each other during the interview between the two commanders which took place in a farmhouse in appomattox courthouse general lee was accompanied only by colonel marshall of his staff and on the federal side only a few officers were present general grants demeanor was courteous and that of general lee * by emotion of any description the hardships of the retreat had somewhat impaired his strength and his countenance exhibited traces of fatigue but no other change had taken place in his appearance he was erect calm courteous and confined his observations strictly to the disagreeable business before him the interview was brief and seated at a plain table the two commanders wrote and exchanged the accompanying papers the two generals then bowed to each other and leaving the house general lee mounted his gray and rode back to his headquarters the scene as he passed through the army was affecting the men gathered round him wrung his hand and in broken words called upon god to help him this pathetic reception by his old soldiers profoundly affected lee the tears came to his eyes and looking at the men with a glance of proud feeling he said in suppressed tones which trembled slightly we have fought through the war together i have done the best i could for you my heart is too full to say more these few words seemed to be all he could utter he rode on and reaching his headquarters in the woods disappeared in his tent whither we shall not follow him on the next day the army of northern virginia numbering about twentysix thousand men of whom but seven thousand eight hundred carried muskets was formally surrendered and the confederate war was a thing of the past general lee on the day following the capitulation of his army issued an address to his old soldiers which they received and read with very deep emotion the address was in these words the painful arrangements connected with the capitulation were on this day concluded and general lee prepared to set out on his return to * his men a paroled prisoner of the army of northern virginia the parting between him and his soldiers was pathetic he exchanged with all near him a close pressure of the hand uttered a few simple words of farewell and mounting his irongray traveller who had passed through all the fighting of the campaign unharmed rode slowly in the direction of richmond he was escorted by a detachment of federal cavalry preceded only by a * and the party including the officers who accompanied him consisted of about twentyfive horsemen the cortge was followed by several wagons carrying the private effects of himself and his companions and by the wellknown old black open vehicle which he had occasionally used during the campaigns of the preceding year when indisposition prevented him from mounting his horse in this vehicle it had been his custom to carry stores for the * had never been used for articles contributing to his personal convenience general lees demeanor on his way to richmond was entirely composed and his thoughts seemed much more occupied by the unfortunate condition of the poor people at whose houses he stopped than by his own situation when he found that all along his route the impoverished people had cooked provisions in readiness for him and were looking anxiously for him with every indication of love and admiration he said to one of his officers these good people are * kind their hearts are as full as when we began our first campaigns in 1861 they do too * than they are able to * us his soldierly habits remained unchanged and he seemed unwilling to indulge in any luxuries or comforts which could not be shared by the gentlemen accompanying him at a house which he reached just as night came a poor woman had prepared an excellent bed for him but with a courteous shake of the head he spread his blanket and slept upon the floor stopping on the next day at the house of his brother charles carter lee in powhatan he spent the evening in conversation but when bedtime came left the house in spite of the fact that it had begun to rain and crossing the road into the woods took up his quarters for the night on the hard planks of his old black vehicle on the route he exhibited great solicitude about a small quantity of oats which he had brought with him in one of the wagons for his old companion traveller mentioning it more than once and appearing anxious lest it should be lost or used by some one the party came in sight of richmond at last and two or three miles from the city general lee rode ahead of his escort accompanied only by a few officers and crossing the pontoon bridge below the ruins of * bridge which had been destroyed when the confederate forces retreated entered the capital the spectacle which met his eyes at this moment must have been exceedingly painful in the great conflagration which had taken place on the morning of the 3d of april a large portion of the city had been burned and as general lee rode up main street formerly so handsome and attractive he saw on either hand only masses of blackened ruins as he rode slowly through the opening between these masses of dbris he was recognized by the few persons who were on the street and instantly the intelligence of his presence spread through the city the inhabitants hastened from their houses and flocked to welcome him saluting him with cheers and the waving of hats and handkerchiefs he seemed desirous however of avoiding this ovation and returning the greeting by simply raising his hat rode on and reached his house on franklin street where respecting his desire for privacy under circumstances so painful his admirers did not intrude upon him we have presented this brief narrative of the incidents attending general lees return to his home after the surrender to show with what simplicity and good sense he accepted his trying situation a small amount of * forward one of his officers to announce his intended arrival stopping for a few moments as he ascended main street making an address to the citizens who first recognized him and thus affording time for a crowd to * proceedings on the part of general lee would have resulted in an ovation such as a vanquished commander never before received at the hands of any people nothing however was less desired by general lee than this tumultuous reception the native modesty of the man not only shrunk from such an ovation he avoided it for another * pretext it would probably afford to the federal authorities to proceed to harsh measures against the unfortunate persons who took part in it in accordance with these sentiments general lee had not announced his coming had not stopped as he rode through the city and now shutting himself up in his house signified his desire to avoid a public reception and to be left in privacy this policy he is well known to have pursued from that time to the end of his life he uniformly declined with great courtesy but firmly invitations to attend public gatherings of any description where his presence might arouse passions or occasion discussions connected with the great contest in which he had been the leader of the south a mind less firm and noble would doubtless have yielded to this great temptation it is sweet to the soldier who has been overwhelmed and has yielded up his sword to feel that the love and admiration of a people still follow him and to have the consolation of receiving public evidences of this unchanged devotion that this love of the southern people for lee deeply touched him there can be no doubt but it did not blind him to his duty as the representative individual of the south feeling that nothing was now left the southern people but an honest acceptance of the situation and a cessation as far as possible of all rancor toward the north he refused to encourage sentiments of hostility between the two sections and did all in his power to restore amicable feeling i am very glad to learn he said in a note to the present writer that your life of general jackson is of the character you describe i think all topics or questions calculated to excite angry discussion or hostile feelings should be avoided these few words convey a distinct idea of general lees views and feelings he had fought to the best of his ability for southern independence of the north the south had failed in the struggle and it was now in his opinion the duty of every good citizen to frankly * in the result and endeavor to avoid all that kept open the bleeding wounds of the country his military career had placed him in the estimation of the first men of his time among the greatest soldiers of history but the dignity and moderation of the course pursued by him from the end of the war to the time of his death will probably remain in the opinion of both his friends and enemies the noblest illustration of the character of the man in the concluding pages of this volume we shall not be called upon to narrate either military or political events with the surrender at appomattox courthouse the confederate war * attempt was made by general johnston or other commanders to prolong * that great whirlpool all hopes of further resistance disappeared we have therefore now no task before us but to follow general lee into private life and present a few details of his latter years and his death these notices will be brief but will not we hope be devoid of interest the soldier who had so long led the confederate armies was to enter in his latter days upon a new field of labor and if in this field he won no new glories he at least displayed the loftiest virtues and exhibited that rare combination of greatness and gentleness which makes up a character altogether lovely adhering to the resolution formed in 1861 never again to draw his sword except in defence of virginia general lee after the surrender sought for some occupation feeling the necessity doubtless of in some manner employing his energies he is said to have had offered to him but to have courteously declined estates in england and ireland and to have also declined the place of commercial agent of the south in new york which would have proved exceedingly lucrative in the summer of 1865 however he accepted an offer more congenial to his * of the presidency of washington college at * in the autumn of that year entered upon his duties which he continued to perform with great energy and success to the day of his death of the excellent judgment and great administrative capacity which he displayed in this new field of labor we have never heard any question it was the name and example however of lee which proved so valuable drawing to the college more than five hundred students from all portions of the south and some even from the north upon the subject of general lees life at washington college a more important authority than that of the present writer will soon speak in the memorial volume whose publication will probably precede or immediately follow the appearance of this work full details will no doubt be presented of this interesting period the subject possesses rare interest and the facts presented will beyond all question serve to bring out new beauties in a character already regarded with extraordinary love and admiration by men of all parties and opinions to the volume in question we refer the reader who desires the * portrait of one concerning whom too much cannot be written during the period extending between the end of the war and general lees death he appeared in public but two or three * at washington as a witness before a congressional committee styled the reconstruction committee to inquire into the condition of things in the south again as a witness on the proposed trial of president davis and perhaps on one or two additional occasions not of great interest or importance his testimony was not taken on the trial of the president which was deferred and finally abandoned but he was subjected before the washington committee to a long and searching examination in which it is difficult to decide whether his own calmness good sense and outspoken frankness or the bad taste of some of the questions * to him were the more remarkable as the testimony of general lee upon this occasion presents a full exposition of his views upon many of the most important points connected with the condition of the south and the reconstruction policy a portion of the newspaper report of his evidence is here given as both calculated to interest the reader and to illustrate the subject the above extract presents the main portion of general lees testimony and is certainly an admirable exposition of the clear good sense and frankness of the individual once or twice there is obviously an undercurrent of dry satire as in his replies upon the subject of the confederate bonds when asked whether he remembered at what time these bonds were made payable he replied that his general recollection was that they were made payable six months after a declaration of peace the correction was at once made by his * in the words six months after the ratification of a treaty of peace etc i think they ran that way replied general lee so that retorted his * the bonds are not yet due by their terms general lees reply was i suppose unless it is considered that there is a peace now they are not due this seems to have put an abrupt termination to the examination on that point to the question whether he had taken an oath of allegiance to the confederate government he replied i do not recollect having done so but it is possible that when i was commissioned i did i do not recollect whether it was required if it was required i took it or if it had been required i would have taken it if this reply of general lee be attentively weighed by the reader some conception may be formed of the bitter pang which he must have experienced in sending in as he did to the federal government his application for pardon the fact cannot be concealed that this proceeding on the part of general lee was a subject of deep regret to the southern people but there can be no question that his motive was disinterested and noble and that he presented in so doing the most remarkable evidence of the true greatness of his character he had no personal advantage to expect from a pardon cared absolutely nothing whether he were pardoned or not and to one so proud and so thoroughly convinced of the justice of the cause in which he had fought to appear as a * must have been inexpressibly painful he nevertheless took this mortifying * entirely by that sense of duty which remained with him to the last overmastering every other sentiment of his nature he seems in this as in many other things to have felt the immense import of his example the old soldiers of his army and thousands of civilians were obliged to apply for amnesty or remain under civic * brave men with families depending upon them had been driven to this painful course and general lee seems to have felt that duty to his old comrades demanded that he too should swallow this bitter draught and share their humiliation as he had shared their dangers and their glory if this be not the explanation of the motives controlling general lees action the writer is unable to account for the course which he pursued that it is the sole explanation the writer no more doubts than he doubts the fact of his own existence for about five * the latter part of 1865 nearly to the end of #* lee continued to concentrate his entire attention and all his energies upon his duties as president of washington college to which his great name and the desire of southern parents to have their sons educated under a guide so illustrious attracted as we have said more than five hundred students the * nature of these occupations was a painful trial to one so long accustomed to lead a life of activity but it was not in the character of the individual to allow personal considerations to interfere with the performance of his duty and the laborious supervision of the education of this large number of young gentlemen continued day after day and year after year to occupy his mind and his time to the exclusion wellnigh of every other thought his personal popularity with the students was very great and it is unnecessary to add that their respect for him was unbounded by the citizens of lexington and especially the graver and more pious portion he was regarded with a love and admiration greater than any felt for him during the progress of his military career this was attributable doubtless to the * and clearer exhibition by general lee in his latter years of that extraordinary gentleness and sweetness culminating in devoted christian piety * from all eyes in some degree during the * plainly revealed themselves and were evidently the broad foundation and controlling influences of his whole life and character to speak first of his gentleness and moderation in all his views and utterances of these eminent * and striking above all in a defeated soldier with so much to * * lee presented a very remarkable illustration the result of the war seemed to have left his great soul calm resigned and * by the least rancor while others not more devoted to the south permitted passion and sectional animosity to master them and dictate acts and expressions full of bitterness toward the north general lee refrained systematically from every thing of that description and by simple force of greatness one would have said rose above all prejudices and * of the hour * and giving in his own person to all who approached him the example of moderation and christian charity he aimed to keep alive the old southern traditions of honor and virtue but not that sectional hatred which could produce only evil to a lady who had lost her husband in the war and on bringing her two sons to the college indulged in expressions of great bitterness toward the north general lee said gently madam do not train up your children in hostility to the government of the united states remember that we are one country now dismiss from your mind all sectional feeling and bring them up to be americans a still more suggestive exhibition of his freedom from rancor was presented in an interview which is thus described of the extent of this christian moderation another proof was given by the soldier at a moment when he might not * have been supposed to labor under emotions of the * bitterness soon after his return to richmond in april 1865 when the * * of surrender was still open and bleeding a gentleman was requested by the federal commander in the city to communicate to general lee the fact that he was about to be indicted in the united states courts for treason in * himself of his commission the gentleman expressed sentiments of violent indignation at such a proceeding but these feelings general lee did not seem to share the threat of * him as a traitor produced no other effect upon him than to bring a smile to his lips and taking the hand of his friend as the latter rose to go he said in his * tones we must forgive our enemies i can truly say that not a day has passed since the war began that i have not prayed for them the incidents here related define the views and feelings of general lee as accurately as they could be set forth in a whole volume the defeated commander who could open his poor purse to one of our old soldiers who fought on the other side and pray daily during the bitterest of conflicts for his enemies must surely have trained his spirit to the perfection of christian charity of the strength and controlling character of general lees religious convictions we have more than once spoken in preceding pages of this volume these now seemed to exert a more marked influence over his life and indeed to shape every action and utterance of the man during the war he had exhibited much greater reserve upon this the most important of all subjects which can engage the attention of a human being and although he had been from an early period we believe a * of the * episcopal church he seldom discussed religious questions or spoke of his own feelings presenting in this a marked contrast as we have said to his illustrious associate general jackson even during the war however as the reader has seen in our notices of his character at the end of 1863 general lees piety revealed itself in conversations with his chaplains and other good men and was not concealed from the troops as on the occasion of the prayermeeting in the midst of the fighting at mine run on another occasion when reviewing his army near winchester he was seen to raise his hat to a chaplain with the words i salute the church of god and again near petersburg was observed kneeling in prayer a short distance from the road as his troops marched by still another incident of the * of the * be recorded here in the words of the rev j william jones who relates it these incidents unmistakably indicate that general lee concealed under the natural reserve of his character an earnest religious belief and trust in god and our saviour nor was this a new sentiment with him after his death a * pocket bible was found in his chamber in which was written re lee lieutenantcolonel us army it was plain from this that even during the days of his earlier manhood in mexico and on the western prairies he had read his bible and striven to conform his life to its teachings with the retirement of the great soldier however from the cares of command which necessarily interfered in a large degree with pious exercises and * the religious phase of his character became more clearly defined assuming far more prominent and striking proportions the sufferings of the southern people doubtless had a powerful effect upon him and feeling the * of man he must have turned to god for comfort but this inquiry is too profound for the present writer he shrinks from the attempt to sound the depths of this truly great soul with the view of discovering the influences which moulded it into an almost ideal perfection general lee was fortunately for the world surrounded in his latter days by good and intelligent men fully competent to present a complete exposition of his views and * to these the arduous undertaking is left our easier task is to place upon record such incidents as we have gathered bearing upon the religious phase of the illustrious soldiers character his earnest piety cannot be better displayed than in the anxiety which he felt for the conversion of his students conversing with the rev dr kirkpatrick of the presbyterian church on the subject of the religious welfare of those intrusted to his charge he was so overcome by emotion says dr kirkpatrick that he could not utter the words which were on his tongue his utterance was choked but recovering himself with his eyes overflowing with tears his lips quivering with emotion and both hands raised he exclaimed oh doctor if i could only know that all the young men in the college were good christians i should have nothing more to desire when another minister the rev mr jones delivered an earnest address at the concert of prayer for colleges urging that all christians should pray for the aid of the holy spirit in changing the hearts of the students general lee after the meeting approached the minister and said with great warmth i wish sir to thank you for your address it was just what we needed our great want is a revival which shall bring these young men to christ one morning while the venerable dr white was passing general lees house on his way to chapel the general joined him and they entered into conversation upon religious subjects general lee said little but just as they reached the college stopped and remarked with great earnestness his eyes filling with tears as he spoke i shall be disappointed sir i shall fail in the leading object that brought me here unless the young men all become real christians and i wish you and others of your sacred profession to de all you can to accomplish this result when a great revival of religious feeling took place at the virginia military institute in 1868 general lee said to the clergyman of his church with deep feeling that is the best news i have heard since i have been in lexington would that we could have such a revival in all our colleges although a member of the * episcopal church and preferring that communion general lee seems to have been completely exempt from * feeling and to have aimed first and last to be a true christian loving god and his neighbor and not * himself about theological dogmas when he was asked once whether he believed in the * succession he replied that he had never thought of it and aimed only to become a real christian his catholic views were shown by the letters of invitation which he addressed at the commencement of each session of the college to ministers of all religious denominations at lexington to conduct in turn the religious exercises at the college chapel and his charities which were large for a person of his limited means were given to all alike these charities he seems to have regarded as a binding duty and were so private that only those receiving them knew any thing of them it only came to be known accidentally that in 1870 he gave one hundred dollars for the education of the orphans of southern soldiers one hundred dollars to the young mens christian association and regularly made other * amounting in all to considerable sums nearly his last act was a liberal contribution to an important object connected with his church we shall conclude these anecdotes illustrating general lees religious character with one for which we are indebted to the kindness of a reverend clergyman of lexington who knew general lee intimately in his latter years and enjoyed his confidence the incident will present in an agreeable light the great soldiers simplicity and love for children and no less his catholic feelings in reference to sects in the christian church i will give you just another incident writes the reverend gentleman illustrating general lees love for children and their freedom with him when i first came to lexington my boy carter just four years old then used to go with me to chapel service when it was my turn to officiate the general would tell him that he must always sit by him and it was a scene for a painter to see the great chieftain * listening to the truths of gods word and the little boy nestling close to him one sunday our sundayschool superintendent told the children that they must bring in some new scholars and that they must bring old people as well as the young since none were too old or too wise to learn gods word the next sabbath carter was with me at the chapel from which he was to go with me to the sundayschool at the close of the service i noticed that carter was talking very earnestly with general lee who seemed very much amused and on calling him to come with me he said with childish simplicity father i am trying to get general lee to go to the sundayschool and be my scholar but said i if the general goes to any school he will go to his own which is his own father the episcopal i replied heaving a deep sigh and with a look of disappointment the little fellow said i am very sorry he is * i wish he was a baptist so he could go to our sundayschool and be my scholar the general seemed very much amused and interested as he replied ah carter we must all try and be good * is the most important thing he knew all the children in town adds mr jones and their grief at his death was very touching this incident may appear singular to those who have been accustomed to regard general lee as a cold reserved and even stern human * statue beneath whose chill surface no heart ever throbbed but instead of a marble heart there lay under the gray uniform of the soldier one of warm flesh and * * susceptible to the quick touches of all gentle and sweet emotion and filling as it were with quiet happiness at the sight of children and the sound of their voices this * has even been made the subject of criticism a foreign writer declares that the soldiers character exhibited a feminine softness * him for the conduct of affairs of moment what the confederacy wanted intimates the writer in question was a rough dictator with little regard for nice questions of * to lay the rough hand of the born master on the helm and force the crew from the highest to the lowest to obey his will that will probably remain a question general lees will was strong enough to break down all obstacles but those erected by rightful authority that with this masculine strength he united an exquisite gentleness is equally beyond question a noble action flushed his cheek with an emotion that the reader may if he will call feminine a tale of suffering brought a sudden moisture to his eyes and a loving message from one of his poor old soldiers was seen one day to melt him to tears this poor and incomplete attempt to indicate some of the * traits of the illustrious commanderinchief of the southern armies will now be brought to a conclusion we approach the sorrowful moment when surrounded by his weeping family he tranquilly passed away on the 28th of september 1870 after laborious attention to his duties during the early part of the day general lee attended in the afternoon a meeting of the vestry of grace church of which he was a member over this meeting he presided and it was afterward remembered that his last public act was to contribute the sum of fiftyfive dollars to some good object the requisite amount to effect which was thus made up after the meeting general lee returned to his home and when tea was served took his place at the table to say grace as was his habit as it had been in camp throughout the war his lips opened but no sound issued from them and he sank back in his chair from which he was carried to bed the painful intelligence immediately became known throughout lexington and the utmost grief and consternation were visible upon every face it was hoped at first that the attack would not prove serious and that general lee would soon be able to resume his duties but this hope was soon dissipated the skilful physicians who hastened to his bedside pronounced his malady congestion of the brain and from the appearance of the patient who lay in a species of * the attack was evidently of the most alarming character the most discouraging phase of the case was that physically general lee * we may so * perfect health his superb physique although not perhaps as vigorous and robust as during the war exhibited no indication whatever of disease his health appeared perfect and twenty years more of life might have been predicted for him from simple reference to his appearance the malady was more deeply seated however than any bodily disease the * congestion was but a symptom of the mental malady which was killing its victim from the testimony of the able physicians who watched the great soldier day and night throughout his illness and are thus best competent to speak upon the subject there seems no doubt that general lees condition was the result of mental depression produced by the sufferings of the southern people every mail it is said had brought him the most piteous appeals for assistance from old soldiers whose families were in want of bread and the woes of these poor people had a * effect upon him a year or two before his health had been seriously impaired by this brooding depression and he had visited north carolina the white sulphur springs and other places to divert his mind in this he failed the shadow went with him and the result was at last the alarming attack from which he never rallied during the two weeks of his illness he scarcely spoke and evidently regarded his condition as hopeless when one of his physicians said to him general you must make haste and get well traveller has been standing so long in his stable that he needs exercise general lee shook his head slowly to indicate that he would never again mount his favorite horse he remained in this state with few alterations in his condition until wednesday october 12th when about nine in the morning in the midst of his family the great soldier tranquilly expired of the universal grief of the southern people when the intelligence was transmitted by telegraph to all parts of the country it is not necessary that we should speak the death of lee seemed to make all hearts stand still and the tolling of bells flags at halfmast and public meetings of citizens wearing mourning marked in every portion of the south the sense of a great public calamity it is not an exaggeration to say that in ten thousand southern homes tears came to the eyes not only of women but of bearded men and that the words lee is dead fell like a * upon every heart when the intelligence reached richmond the legislature passed resolutions expressive of the general sorrow and requesting that the remains of general lee might be interred in * * walker the governor expressing in a special message his participation in the grief of the people of virginia and the south the family of general lee however preferred that his remains should rest at the scene of his last labors and beneath the chapel of washington college they were accordingly interred the ceremony was imposing and will long be remembered on the morning of the 13th the body was borne to the college chapel in front moved a guard of honor composed of old confederate soldiers behind these came the clergy then the hearse in rear of which was led the dead soldiers favorite warhorse traveller his equipments wreathed with crape the trustees and faculty of the college the cadets of the military institute and a large number of citizens * the procession moved slowly from the northeastern gate of the presidents house to the college chapel above which draped in mourning and at halfmast floated the flag of * only one displayed during this or any other portion of the funeral ceremonies on the platform of the chapel the body lay in state throughout this and the succeeding day the coffin was covered with evergreens and flowers and the face of the dead was uncovered that all might look for the last time on the pale features of the illustrious soldier the body was dressed in a simple suit of black and the appearance of the face was perfectly natural great crowds visited the chapel passing solemnly in front of the * silence interrupted only by sobs throughout the 14th the body continued to be in state and to be visited by thousands on the 15th a great funeral procession preceded the commission of it to its last resting place at an early hour the crowd began to assemble in the vicinity of the college which was draped in mourning this great concourse was composed of men women and children all wearing crape and the little children seemed as much penetrated by the general distress as the elders the bells of the churches began to toll and at ten oclock the students of the college and officers and soldiers of the confederate * together nearly one thousand * in front of the chapel between the two bodies stood the hearse and the gray horse of the soldier both draped in mourning the procession then began to move to the strains of martial music the military escort together with the staffofficers of general lee moved in front the faculty and students followed behind the hearse and in rear came a committee of the legislative dignitaries of the commonwealth and a great multitude of citizens from all portions of the state the procession continued its way toward the institute where the cadets made the military salute as the hearse passed in front of them and the sudden thunder of artillery awoke the echoes from the hills the cadets then joined the procession which was more than a mile in length and heralded by the fire of artillery every few minutes it moved back to the college chapel where the last services were performed general lee had requested it is said that no funeral oration should be pronounced above his remains and the rev william n pendleton simply read the beautiful * of the episcopal church the coffin still covered with evergreens and flowers was then lowered to its restingplace beneath the chapel amid the sobs and tears of the great assembly and all that was mortal of the illustrious soldier disappeared from the worlds eyes what thus disappeared was little what remained was * memory of the virtues and the glory of the greatest of virginians
