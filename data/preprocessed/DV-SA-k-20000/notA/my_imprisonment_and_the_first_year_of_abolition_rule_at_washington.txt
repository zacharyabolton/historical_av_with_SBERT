whether a faithful record of my long and humiliating imprisonment at washington in the hands of the enemies of my country will prove as interesting to the public as my friends assure me it is to them i know not it is natural for those who have suffered captivity to exaggerate the importance and interest of their own experiences yet i should not venture upon publishing these notes and sketches merely as a narrative of indignities heaped upon myself personally it is hoped that the story may excite more than a simple feeling of indignation or commiseration by exhibiting somewhat of the intolerant spirit in which the present crusade against the liberties of sovereign states was undertaken and somewhat of the true character of that race of people who insist on compelling us by force to live with them in bonds of fellowship and union i had been long a resident of washington before the secession of the confederate states and from my intimate acquaintance with public men and public measures under the old government had peculiar and exceptional means of watching the progressive development of the designs of these leaders of opinion in the federal states which as i had long foreseen would necessarily end in forcing on a separation much of my information upon this subject had been derived from the intercourse of society in the federal capital and would therefore have been * to be made public if the relations of the north and the south had continued as they used to be subjects of political discussion and party contest but the federal leaders have now carried the matter far beyond this point after repeated and intolerable aggression upon the rights of these states accompanied and aggravated by an insulting tone of moral superiority until a union with such communities was no longer to be endured by any highspirited people they at length stirred up a furious and desolating war for two years a torrent of blood has flowed between their people and my people the noble state of virginia with which i am most nearly connected has been devastated by hosts of barbarous invaders always overthrown indeed in the field before southern valour but always destroying and plundering where they found the country unprotected whilst my own dear native state of maryland has been subject to a still more stinging and maddening oppression in the utter destruction of all her liberties and in the establishment of a brutal and vulgar military despotism which has reduced the gallant old state to the * condition of poland or * and such order reigns in baltimore as that moral death which tyrants call order in * or in the beautiful city of the sea to me therefore the days of my former abode in washington seem to belong almost to another state of being that time when i in common with all our people looked up with pride and veneration to the banner of the stars and stripes appears to be now with the years before the flood i look back to the scenes of that period through a haze of blood and horror those men whom i once called friends who have broken bread at my table have since then stirred up and * on host after host of greedy invaders and precipitated them upon the beloved valleys where my kindred had their peaceful homes many who were dear to me have been slain or maimed for life fighting in defence of all that makes life of value instead of friends i see in those statesmen of washington only mortal enemies instead of loving and worshipping the old flag of the stars and stripes i see in it only the symbol of murder plunder oppression and shame and like every other faithful confederate i dwell with delight on the many glorious fields where this * standard has gone down before the stainless battleflag of the confederacy in short two years of terrible war equivalent an age of quiet life have passed through the existence of us all leaving a deep and * track between us and those former friends there is a gulf deep and wide as eternity and under these circumstances i have felt myself at liberty to be much more unreserved in the narrative of my personal recollections suppressing in fact nothing which i thought would be either interesting or useful to my confederate countrymen except only when reserve was dictated by selfrespect or by the duty of avoiding * which might compromise the safety of certain federal officers whom i induced without scruple as will be more fully seen in the following pages to furnish me with information even in my captivity which information i at once communicated with pride and pleasure to general beauregard then commanding the confederate forces near washington whatever may be thought of the conduct of these federal officers in betraying to an avowed enemy secrets material to their own government it will readily be admitted that after having made this use of them i should not have been justified in * them or affording a clue by which they could be discovered if in detailing conversations which passed either with me or in my presence before or after my arrest i may be thought to have exhibited too great bitterness it is hoped that the circumstances under which i found myself may plead my excuse it will be seen that i was well aware from an early period of the dark designs of the abolition leaders at washington and that while they were holding publicly the language of patriotic zeal for the constitution and the law they were already * and preparing all the dreadful scenes of lawless outrage and spoliation which have since that time rendered their names odious to the whole world it was well known to me what fate they were reserving for my own native state and what diabolical agencies they were setting to work over all the country both to destroy the confederate states and to crush out the liberties of the north the chief * of all these horrors too were well aware that i knew their plans and machinations intimately and that weak woman as i was i possessed both the means and the spirit to throw serious obstacle in their way hence the keen and jealous surveillance by which my every motion was observed and noted even long before my arrest hence also the useless series of torments and * to which i was subjected the changes in my place of imprisonment and the many attempts to entrap me into a betrayal of myself or the confederate cause hence the long and wearisome captivity to break my spirit or goad me into undignified bursts of indignation in all of which i trust i may flatter myself that they signally failed satisfied thoroughly of the justice and sacredness of our great cause thinking only of the gallant struggle into which my kindred had thrown themselves i was enabled not only to possess my own soul and keep my own counsel but also to establish and maintain a continuous correspondence with virginia and reveal certain contemplated military movements of enemy in time to have them thwarted by our generals for this i do not desire to take any special credit in the eyes of the public i only performed my duty and have already been gratified by the thanks of those who best can judge of the services which i endeavoured to render and the matter is mentioned here merely as one of the reasons why it has been thought that a narrative furnished by one who enjoyed such opportunities of observation may be found not uninteresting it may be that the language which was sometimes extorted from me in conversation or some of the remarks now found in my book are more bitterly * and sarcastic than in ordinary times and upon ordinary subjects would be becoming in the personal narrative of a woman those who may think so are only entreated before they judge to endeavour to imagine themselves in my position subject to the stinging indignities of a washington prison having to encounter sometimes the vicious taunts of vulgar guards sometimes the treacherous warnings or counsels of politicians pretending to be my friends a little daughter too always before my eyes torn from the peaceful delights of home and the flowery path of girlhood and forced to witness the hard realities of * and hear the keys * in dungeon locks no wonder if my nature grew harsh and more vindictive and if the scorn and wrath that was in my heart sometimes found vent by tongue or pen it was above all things when i thought of my own state of maryland where sleep the manes of my ancestors that i burned with indignation in my prison while the great state of virginia with her strong river frontier of the potomac was enabled to bid defiance to the utmost efforts of her enemies it soon became evident that maryland penetrated by great bays and rivers and with her very heart opened up to the naval forces of the enemy would be for the present at least overpowered and prevented from casting her lot openly and decisively with her sister states i knew also that every genuine child of maryland cherished in their souls but one feeling one burning desire to share the destiny of their section and to perish if need be in the glorious struggle and could well imagine how so proud and refined a people would suffer and * to see themselves treated as * and * by a race they have always despised yet the men were not so deeply to be pitied they had always at least the resource of flinging themselves across the border joining the confederate service and thus either opening a way to the redemption of their country or at any rate meeting her oppressors on many a battlefield and * a righteous vengeance upon their heads but the women of maryland the * * and * ladies of that fair state they whose slightest notice in days gone by was so dearly prized by northern men they so essentially southern in taste and style and association to see their country ruled by hordes of the despised yankees and their haughty city * and cowering under the insolent sway of the * of all human creatures to know that the tinkling of that little bell at the state department could tear the maiden from her mothers arms to be dragged to the * of a yankee prison the thought was often almost maddening and it may well be that my profound sympathy with my people has coloured with a deeper tinge of gloom my views of the whole field of action at all events i have endeavoured in this sketch of my captivity to discharge a great duty that duty was to contribute what i myself have seen and known of the history of the time if the exposure therein made of the yankee character in the first year of its luxuriant and rampant development after long * in a condition of inferiority shall add to the feeling of * for such a race of people and deepen the universal gratitude at the happy change which has severed us from them and made it still more and more impossible that we can ever submit to any kind of political association with them again then my poor narrative will not have been written in vain on friday august 23rd in washington city the metropolis of this once free and happy land the proud boast of which was that life liberty and property were protected by the law i was made a prisoner in my own house and subjected to an ordeal which must have been copied from the days of the directory in france my blood * when i think of it but for the benefit of all who may feel an interest in the subject i will give a circumstantial account of an act which should shed renown upon the distinguished authors of it it is necessary for my purpose to make a brief * of the incidents of the few months preceding i might even go back to the advent of the scotch cap and cloak but will content myself with an event quite as remarkable in the reign of the abolition irrepressible conflict chief whose shadow now * the chair of washington as the allusion to the scotch cap and cloak may not be generally understood i deem it advisable to furnish information on that head as a means of explaining the * * by which the abolition leader entered the national capitol he had been elected president by a strictly sectional majority not having received one vote in the states south of mason and dixons line the great geographical line dividing north and south arriving thereby at the very point in our political destiny which washington in his farewell address had foreshadowed as a cause for the dissolution of the union during the heated sectional contest which resulted in the election of mr lincoln by the abolition party they openly proclaimed the higher law doctrine and announced their determination regardless of constitutional guarantees to deprive the south of her sovereign equal rights and to reduce her to a state of * for a feeling of bitter jealousy had been * and strengthening in the northern mind against her on account of the superior statesmanship and intellect which had always given her * in the councils of the nation and in the legislative assemblies in order to carry into effect this hostile determination to destroy the political importance of the south they had seized upon what they conceived to be the vulnerable point in our domestic institution well knowing that they could enlist the fanatical aid and sympathy of those who were ignorant save * of that institution and of the benign and paternal manner in which it was conducted in the south having in view no object themselves of * the condition of the servile class but to * or drive them out in order that their own pauper population might secure to themselves the superior advantages which were everywhere in the south * by the slave population denunciations were levelled against us by the poorer classes of the north as a pampered aristocracy for the reason they gave that a poor white man at the south was not as good as a negro and the negroes i must confess always * to themselves this social superiority for the bitterest insult they could offer each other was you are no better than a poor white yankee the abolition party were not however prepared for the firm and dignified bearing of the south at the result of an election strictly sectional and avowedly subversive of the constitution and they believed according to their own established precedent that mob law would take the matter in hand and summarily dispose of the candidate elect or prevent his inauguration excited and absurd discussions and plans were made at washington and other places as to the means by which he should reach the capital lincoln had however formed a plan of his own and having far more reticence than had been ascribed to him by his partisans executed it whilst these discussion were going on and suddenly appeared at washington at six oclock in the morning under the disguise of a scotch cap and cloak announcing himself with characteristic phraseology in the apartments of his sleeping committee of safety at willards hotel with * just look at me by * my own * wouldnt know me on the morning of the 16th of july the government papers at washington announced that the grand army was in motion and i learned from a reliable source having received a copy of the order to * that the order for a forward movement had gone forth if earth did not tremble surely there was great commotion amongst that class of the * * yclept military men officers and orderlies on horse were seen flying from place to place the tramp of armed men was heard on every side martial music filled the air in short a mighty host was * with all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war on to richmond was the warcry the heroes girded on their * with the enthusiasm of the * of old and vowed to flesh their maiden swords in the blood of beauregard or lee and many a knight inspired by * smiles swore to lay at the feet of her he loved best the head of jeff davis at least nothing nothing was wanting to render the gorgeous pageant imposing so with drums beating and flying colours and amidst the shower of flowers thrown by the hands of yankee maidens the grand army moved on to the land of washington of jefferson of madison and monroe whilst the * southerners who remained did not tear their hair and rend their garments but prayed on their knees that the god of battles would award the victory to the just cause in fear and trembling they awaited the result hoping yet fearing to hope time seemed to move on leaden wings imagination sounded in their ears the booming cannon and many a time their hearts died within them at the sickening delay few had the hope which filled my own soul or shared in its exultant certainty of the result at twelve oclock on the morning of the 16th of july i despatched a messenger to manassas who arrived there at eight oclock that night the answer received by me at midday on the 17th will tell the purport of my communication yours was received at eight oclock at night let them come we are ready for them we rely upon you for precise information be particular as to description and destination of forces quantity of artillery c signed * * * on the 17th i despatched another missive to manassas for i had learned of the intention of the enemy to cut the winchester railroad so as to intercept johnson and prevent his reinforcing beauregard who had comparatively but a small force under his command at manassas on the night of the 18th news of a great victory by the federal troops at bull run reached washington throughout the length and breadth of the city it was cried i heard it in new york on saturday 20th where i had gone for the purpose of * a member of my family for california on the steamer of the #* the accounts were received with frantic * and * were freely taken in support of mr sewards wise * that the rebellion would be crushed out in thirty days my heart told me that the triumph was premature yet o my god how miserable i was for the fate of my beloved country which hung trembling in the balance my * were more than justified by the result on sunday 21st the great battle of manassas was fought memorable in history as that of * or waterloo which ended in the total defeat and rout of the entire grand army in the worlds history such a sight was never witnessed statesmen senators congressmen generals and officers of every grade soldiers teamsters all rushing in frantic flight as if pursued by countless demons for miles the country was thick with ambulances accoutrements of war c the actual scene beggars all description so i must in despair relinquish the effort to portray it the news of the disastrous rout of the yankee army was cried through the streets of new york on the #* the whole city seemed paralysed by fear and i verily believe that a thousand men could have marched from the central park to the battery without resistance for their depression now was commensurate with the wild exultation of a few days before on the afternoon of that day i left new york for washington where i arrived at six oclock in the morning of the 23rd in a most impatient mood even at that early hour friends were awaiting my arrival anxious to recount the particulars of the glorious victory a despatch was also received from manassas by me our president and our general direct me to thank you we rely upon you for further information the confederacy owes you a debt signed * adjutantgeneral my first impulse was to throw myself upon my knees and offer up my tearful thanks to the father of mercy for his signal protection in our hour of peril during my journey from new york the craven fear of the yankees was manifested everywhere at philadelphia most of the women got off i was advised to do so by lieutenant wise of u s a soninlaw of edward * as he said it was believed that the rebels of baltimore would rise in consequence of the rout of the federal army i laughingly replied i have no fears these rebels are of my faith besides i fear even now i shall not be in time to welcome our president mr davis and the glorious beauregard he sneeringly replied that i should probably see those gentlemen there in irons i received a scowl also from mr winter davis who was a passenger from new york and had been loud * and denunciatory against the south during the journey i observed however that he and lieutenant wise got off at philadelphia deeming discretion the better part of valour a large force was distributed throughout baltimore and it was even difficult to thread ones way to the train on account of the military who crowded the streets and the dept thence to washington seemed as one vast camp and on reaching the capitol the very * was blocked up by its panicstricken defenders who started at the clank of their own muskets after a hurried toilette and breakfast i went up to the u s senate where i saw the crestfallen leaders who but a few days before had vowed death and * to our race several crowded round me and i could not help saying that if they had not good blood they had certainly good bottom for they ran remarkably well for days after the wildest disorder reigned in the capitol the streets were filled with straggling soldiers each telling the doleful tale and each indulging in imaginary feats of valour which would throw into the shade the achievements of coeur de lion * de * or jack the * even senators entered into this scramble for stray laurels for several assured me wilson and chandler that it was their individual exertions alone which had prevented the entire grand army from precipitating itself pellmell into the potomac and they were really indebted to the discretion of a subordinate officer that the alternative had not been forced upon them a telegraphic order had been sent to washington by general * to cut the draw of the long bridge as beauregard and johnson were hotly pursuing him with fresh troops this bridge * the potomac just opposite washington and was the only means of crossing the river at that point crimination and recrimination now became the order of the day and everybody shrank from the responsibility of the forward movement the commanding general scott said i did nt do it for i was not ready the political directory said we did nt do it it was that old * scott whom we will remove president lincoln said i did nt do it by * i did nt and so in the end the world was about as well informed as to who ordered the advance of the grand army as who killed cock robin about this time i met mr seward who assured me that there was nothing serious the matter that i might assure my friends upon his authority that all would be over in sixty days i answered him well sir you have enjoyed the * of the irrepressible conflict seward had a short time prior to his visit to england in a speech delivered by him at * new york as a bid for the nomination as president by the republican party made use of that remarkable expression of the irrepressible conflict between the white and black races indicating even at that early day the policy to which he would commit himself in order to attain the object of his ambition the executive chair at a later period he endeavoured to explain this away and in conversation with me said if heaven would forgive him for stringing together two highsounding words he would never do it again * things began to quiet down the * of the government press exercised their ingenuity in * the people the countless hosts of the enemy were described these be it known at no time exceeded twelve thousand actually engaged against the more than * force of the invading army their masked batteries and military defences threw into the shade the plains of abraham or even the fortifications of * it would be idle to recount the * of those who fled from imaginary foes or to describe the forlorn condition of the returning heroes who had gone forth to battle flushed with anticipated triumph and crowned in advance with the laurel of victory alas their plight was pitiable enough some were described as being minus hat or shoes amongst this latter class was colonel burnside who on the morning that he * forth for the sacred soil is said to have required two orderlies to carry the flowers showered upon him by the women of northern proclivities meanwhile the muttered sound of the peoples voice was heard from far and near asking meaning questions of the why and wherefore of the disasters it was like the rumbling of the distant thunder * the coming storm and well the abolition government knew that if this discontent was allowed to gather strength it would hurl them from their present lawless eminence to the * they merited the invaders had been taught to believe that a bloodless victory awaited them that the all hail of the witches of macbeth would greet them and so possessed were they with the idea of their philanthropic mission as * of an oppressed people bowed under the yoke of a haughty aristocracy that many of their officers particularly the famous new york 7th regiment took far more pains to prepare white gloves and embroidered * for the balls to be given in their honour at richmond than in securing cartridges for their muskets when consulted on the subject i said no doubt they would receive a great many balls but i did not think that a very * toilet would be expected the fanatical feeling was now at its height maddened by defeat they sought a safe means of * their pentup wrath the streets were filled with armed and unarmed ruffians women were afraid to go singly into the streets for fear of insult curses and * rent the air and no one would have been surprised at any hour at a general massacre of the peaceful inhabitants this apprehension was shared even by the better class of u s officers i was urged to leave the city by more than one and an escort offered to be furnished me if i desired but at whatever peril i resolved to remain conscious of the great service i could render my country my position giving me remarkable facilities for obtaining information in anticipation of more fearful scenes the inhabitants were leaving the city as rapidly as the means of transportation or conveyance could be obtained and many even of the federal officers sent their families to the north or other places of fancied security at this time a number of confederate prisoners who had been taken in the first days fight when our army fell back from bull run were brought to washington and on passing willards hotel were set upon by the crowd who usually congregated there and * with stones and other missiles which seriously wounded a number in order to prevent the prisoners from being actually torn to pieces a company of u s regulars had to be called out to protect them to their quarters the old capitol prison and during the march to that point the soldiers had repeatedly to threaten to fire upon the mob who pressed upon them with shouts and * * as soon as i heard of the circumstance i went up to the prison to minister to the wants of our sufferers and found many with severe cuts and bruises i was accompanied by my friend miss mackall and had the satisfaction of not only being the first friendly face seen by them but to know that i had arrived at the right time for i found there an emissary of lincoln i had like to have said satan dressed in black with a white * who i afterwards learned was mr commissioner wood one of the * for mrs lincolns carriage and horses and who received his appointment in consequence thereof he was with great earnestness * the prisoners and trying to persuade them that they would all be hanged unless they took the oath of allegiance to the abolition government i listened attentively to the man who did not seem to relish the addition to his audience and afterwards as rapidly as i could assured each group of prisoners that mans threat was idle and only for the purpose of * and for some false announcement to the world that the yankees were obliged to treat them as belligerents and hold them as prisoners of war for exchange that our government would fearfully * any violence against them as we held an excess of prisoners of a hundred to one this satisfied them especially the younger portion who each refused the yankee pardon on the terms proposed i afterwards took the list of their various wants and in conjunction with high parties whom it would be imprudent to name supplied them with clothing and other needful things food and beds and bedding * as the yankees had made no provision of any kind save the naked walls of a prison there was an ample confederate fund in washington for this purpose mrs philips and family also exerted themselves in this holy work this lady was arrested in washington at the same time that i was and after a short detention was sent south she then became a resident of new orleans during the reign of terror of butler in that city a yankee funeral passed her house and she was seen to smile upon her balcony during the procession for this grave offence she was dragged before him and questioned as to her motive for doing so to which she dauntlessly replied because i was in a good humour she was condemned to three months imprisonment upon a barren island under a tropical sun with soldiers rations and subjected to other gross and brutal indignities until the poor ladys health gave way and her life became * the representations and remonstrances of the medical attendant who was more humane than his master failed to procure any * of the harsh sentence until the period had expired when she was banished an invalid for life in the course of her examination before butler he said i expect to be killed before i leave the south by either you or mrs greenhow to which she answered we usually order our negroes to kill our swine mr charles sumner was said to have been a * * if not an actual * in that chivalrous demonstration against unarmed prisoners mayhap his wrath was appeased by the sight of the bleeding victims who could hold no correcting rod over his own coward shoulders a few days after an order was given to exclude all visitors in which i was specially named in spite however of the prohibition i had no difficulty in communicating when i desired soon after i passed into other hands my share in this good work for more important employment occupied my time the yankee government and yankee congress were now exercised upon the subject of * their shattered hosts the military committee was specially charged with the task and certainly grave efforts were being made to this end the primary object being to mystify the people as to the past in order to make them blind instruments in the future for it was now truly a nation of * and * at this time the solemn farce was enacted of admitting as u s senators the * members from western virginia i was in the gallery of the senate at the time and happened to remark upon the proceedings to my own party when a man sitting before me in the uniform of lieutenantcolonel of yankee volunteers in company with a number of other officers turned and said that is treason we will show you that it must be put a stop to we have a government to maintain c this was the first effort of the kind to repress freedom of opinion which had come under my observation and the beginning of that reign of terror for which we should be obliged to seek precedents in the age of a * or * yet i confess that it did not surprise me i leaned forward and said deliberately my remarks were addressed to my companions and not to you and if i did not discover by your language that you must be ignorant of all the laws of * i should take the number of your company and report you to your commanding officer to be punished for your impertinence seeing me addressed by him several gentlemen came forward as also the doorkeeper who said madam if he insults you i will put him out to which i replied oh never mind he is too ignorant to know what he has done this defender of the faithful meanwhile played most vehemently with his sword and i expected momentarily to have it drawn against me his brother officers one by one withdrew and left him alone in his glory a few moments after this scene a republican senator came up to the gallery to speak with me and i related the circumstance and advised him to go down to the senate and move a revival of the alien and sedition law as i supposed it would come to that since armed ruffians were placed in the galleries to awe the crowd this brave bore it as long as possible and finally got up and went out i this man once more upon the occasion of my being summoned before the u s commission after i had been some eight months a prisoner he was standing in the doorway of the building in which the commission was held as if he expected to see me a look of triumph lighted up his face as his eye encountered mine i could not resist the temptation of significantly passing my finger across my throat and saying beware as * story of the poor marie antoinette and joseph * came to my mind this was destined to be a day of adventure quite an excitement was caused by a rumour that a battle was going on across the river the confederate forces were at that time in possession of arlington heights the former residence of the venerable park * the grandson of washington from him it had come by inheritance to our own great general lee i went with my party to the portico of the congressional library whence the best view could be obtained and saw the smoke from the campfires gracefully curling up and remarked that is no battle the rebels are cooking their dinners a number of persons had crowded around and joined in the conversation some one proposed to send back to the senate for chandler wilson and foster the heroic trio who had fled so * from the field at manassas spreading the news of the defeat i objected on the score of humanity as it was not right to give such a shock to their nervous systems since neither of those senators had been able to stand the fire in their own pipes since that hapless * race finally i fell into conversation with a lank lean man with a big nose and a pair of green spectacles who asked me if i had ever witnessed a battle i replied that i had experienced a * in the city of mexico in the course of his remarks he said that he would rather give up washington than that it should be held by means of fortifications but that lincoln seward and the whole set were cowards and a great deal more which i considered useful information i knew that this man was a senator and fancied that it might be jim lane of kansas he whom i have denominated as * * he said that he had seen me in the gallery of the senate and asked what i thought of the proceedings i related the attack on my liberty of speech and wondered what sort of performance we should be treated to next whether a tragedy or another farce and i confess gave a most grotesque account of the speeches during the solemn mockery of the morning expressing my surprise that more ingenuity had not been displayed to disguise the * of the act to * and * a sovereign state of her territorial rights * * effort as one for which a schoolboy should have won a * cap i saw a suppressed laugh all around and that the person to whom i spoke seemed embarrassed and finally fell back and spoke with a gentleman of my party this person came to me and said do you know that you have been talking to senator * all this while i was quite as much amused at the * as any of my hearers but i should have considered it a reflection upon my good taste to have been previously * of the fact so assured senator * that i had no idea that the subject of my criticism was the patient listener who stood before me but for once in your life you have heard an honest opinion fearlessly expressed abolitionist as he was i must do him the justice to say that he behaved very well humbug still continued the order of the day at washington another cry was raised that the capitol was again in danger this time the programme was changed the hero of * lane and of mexico was to be laid on the shelf to all purposes superseded but he still stood a mighty ruin in their way propped by the lingering confidence of a nation and no man was bold enough to say this is not the right man for the place cunning and craft were the characteristic qualities called into requisition here seward with * skill affected to support the weak old man wishing to enact the fable of the monkey and the chestnuts but even his selfish policy had to yield to the tempest he had aided to raise as a preparation for what was to follow congress passed an act regulating the pay of the lieutenant general in case of his resignation or voluntary retirement young america now became the theme of every tongue the great battles of the world both in ancient and modern times were proved to have been fought by generals who were * csar * and napoleon were cited as examples and even our own immortal washington had many years * from his actual age when he fought the battles of the revolution the ears of the rabble were * by all this justice was lost sight of and so a young chieftain was summoned to the field of intrigue nothing remarkable thus far had distinguished him above his * but touched by the magic wand of political expediency he came forth * with honours thick upon him in a single day from a subordinate position he became majorgeneral mclellan the virtual head of the * armies whose policy of * honours in advance differed widely from that of the greatest man of the present times in the european world * by whom grades were always conferred after the battle won as witness magenta solferino c subsequent to the rout at manassas president lincoln promoted all the officers many of whom were proved to have fled from the field in advance of their regiments again comes into bold relief the sycophancy of president lincolns * all the military qualities of any age were * * to deck the hero of the hour by degrees they fixed upon the great napoleon as his prototype i suppose from the fact that he is short and rather inclined to * as was * the little corporal and besides * are ever ready to discern what pleases best under the auspices of the young general the military are put in motion hither and thither they are marched and countermarched mysterious movement being his * he however set himself energetically to the task of * and * the demoralised rabble he was called upon to command general scott who at this time was still the nominal commanderinchief wrote a letter to the honourable henry wilson * his patriotic exertion and urging him to accept military command and commending his capacity for such position in very high terms by a singular coincidence mclellan urged the same gentleman to do him the honour to accept the position of chief of his staff this proposition was made by mclellan in the reception room of president lincoln i mention these incidents to show the political bias of all parties at the time that the abolition star was in the * and that everybody * upon its chosen * mclellan also invited the count de paris and duke * to become members of his staff their acceptance was heralded with great circumstance as this * of the aristocratic element into the abolition ranks was regarded as a national triumph edifying accounts were given of their introduction to president lincoln and especially to master bob the abolition * of royalty they were amiable * young frenchmen better fitted from their appearance to assist in mrs lincolns educational scheme thus treading in the footsteps of their royal ancestor louis * who taught french in philadelphia than to win laurels enough to disturb the equanimity of that wise and sagacious prince whom providence has appointed to rule over france a commission of brigadiergeneral was also tendered to * meanwhile the panic at washington instead of * received new impulse each day from some extravagant rumours a strong guard was stationed around all the public buildings the redoubtable jim lane of kansas notoriety and his band of ruffians were quartered in the east room of the white house for the protection of president lincoln and his family sentinels paced to and fro in front of the house and at six oclock in the evening the gates were closed and no one could enter without the * everything about the national capitol betokened the panic of the administration preparations were made for the expected attack and signals arranged to give the alarm the signal was three guns from the provost marshals office followed by the tolling of the church bells at intervals of fifteen minutes by a singular providence for it would be wrong to ascribe these things to chance i went round with the principal officer in charge of this duty and took advantage of the situation the * of the yankees were the rallying cry of a devoted band whose hearts beat high with hope the task before them was worthy of all hazard and our gallant beauregard would have found himself right ably seconded by the rebels of washington had he deemed it expedient to advance on that city a part of the plan was to have cut the telegraph wires connecting the various military positions with the war department to take prisoners mclellan and several others thereby creating still greater confusion in the first moments of panic measures had also been taken to * the guns in fort corcoran fort ellsworth and other important points accurate drawings of which had been furnished to our commanding officer at manassas by me quite an ingenious plan was adopted at this time to discover if the rebel communication was uninterrupted young * the son of the senator of that name and clerk of the military committee who was an occasional and useful visitor at my house brought me a letter for colonel corcoran at richmond with the modest request that i would send it i told him that mclellans excessive vigilance had rendered communication almost impossible but that he might leave it and trust to the chance he called repeatedly to ascertain whether the letter had been sent but i understood the motive and was always very sorry that no opportunity had occurred i need hardly say that during this period i was in almost daily correspondence with manassas the capitol by this had been made one of the strongest fortified cities of the world every avenue to it being guarded by works believed to be impregnable thirtythree fortifications surrounded it but this alone was not deemed sufficient extraordinary vigilance was exercised * and news boys were overhauled to look for treasonable correspondence every box was either a masked battery or infernal machine but alas without success until a sudden inspiration seized them the southern women of washington are the cause of the defeat of the grand army they are entitled to the laurels won by the brave defenders of our soil and institutions they have told beauregard when to strike they with their siren arts have possessed themselves of the plans and schemes of the lincoln cabinet and warned jeff davis of them the most skillful detectives were summoned from far and near to trace the steps of maids and matrons for several weeks i had been followed and my house watched by those emissaries of the state department the detective police this was often a subject of amusement to me and several times when accompanied by my young friend miss mackall we would turn and follow those who we fancied were giving us an undue share of attention still i believed it private enterprise * with some philanthropist who had my wellbeing at heart for i was slow to credit that even the fragment of a once glorious government could give to the world such a proof of craven fear and weakness as to turn the arms which the blind confidence of a deluded people had placed in their hands for the achievement of other ends against the breasts of helpless defenceless women and children nevertheless it is a fact significant of events to follow lawless acts of violence seldom stand alone and the careful readers of the history of the last two hundred years will find numerous parallel cases no nation on the face of the globe has made such rapid strides to despotism as the federal government the first acts of the republican president were to violate the express provisions of the constitution those * provided by the wisdom of our fathers for the protection of the rights of the citizen have been suspended under the plea of military necessity the law of the land has given place to the law of the despot the first act of the republican congress assembled in this city of washington on the 4th day july 1861 was to * the acts of their president thereby admitting that he the chief magistrate the nation had been guilty of perjury and treason before god and man for his oath of office had been to support the constitution of the united states and to administer the laws in accordance with its provisions but instead of being * for his crimes he was * and unlimited powers were conferred upon him a few voices were raised in protest in both houses of congress breckenridge made a speech on the occasion which must transmit his name with undying honour to posterity for it was the last cry of freedom ever to be heard in those walls until they shall have been * by fire and blood no voice of inspiration is needed to point where this nation is drifting the crimes which have disgraced other lands from the contemplation of which humanity shrinks appalled will yet be enacted here a people do not sink at once from the height of prosperity and power and civilisation to the lowest * of lawless despotism without some spasmodic attempts at * but the systematic efforts at * will soon be apparent the public taste will become * the voice of conscience will be smothered by the * for excitement fanaticism will assume the guise of patriotism and under that sacred name the rights of civilisation will be trampled under foot the guillotine was a most humane invention but in the hands of a lawless mob became a fearful instrument of vengeance and has damned to immortality its harmless inventor who also perished by it mr lincoln and his minister of state mr seward have set at work the social guillotine and i am but a poor prophet unless in its evolutions they also become the victims for they have inaugurated a mighty revolution the bitter fruits of which will be brought home to them it was the intention of the abolitionists to arrest breckenridge for treason immediately on the conclusion of his speech had he afforded the slightest pretext for doing so several of the prominent leaders had told me that they had committed a blunder in ever having allowed him to take his seat i warned mr breckenridge of his danger and gave him the names of the parties who had spoken thus to me he at once recognised his peril and * his speech as to avoid the threatened danger at which the abolitionists were greatly chagrined charles sumner was anxious that a * should be applied to those senators who were considered of doubtful loyalty to the * as had be already done to officers of the army colonel john lee having the * notoriety of being the first * officer who subscribed to this oath of allegiance to the tyrant it must not be supposed that the social element was neglected in these times of stern alarm mr seward was too new in his character of diplomatist to disregard so important a * of success he had recently returned from europe had * in the smiles of lord john russell and the exeter hall clique and had been taught by a charming diplomatic lady that a white * was alone comme il faut at a dinner or evening party so he took the club house made memorable in washington on account of its proximity to the scene of that fearful * tragedy and commenced a series of entertainments which were attended by a vast crowd of men in uniforms and a sparse * of women who with few exceptions were not of a class to shed much lustre on the republican court for the refinement and grace which had once constituted the charm of washington life had long since departed and like its former freedom was now alas a tradition only we find by historical observation that nations as they begin to decline in morality and civilisation have always a morbid passion for * and amusements which address themselves to the physical senses france in her days of revolution had her * to the goddess of liberty mexico her * the yankee nation her colossal reviews and mimic battles at which president lincoln surrounded by his * complacently assisted as if the * of artillery which rent the air in his honour could shut out from the ears of heaven as well as from his own the wail of the widow and the orphan it is difficult to reconcile the frivolity of these people from the beginning with a sense of the perils which environed them mr seward even after the * rout at manassas when * of their dead lay * the sacred soil persisted in saying there is nothing the matter president lincoln still said there is nobody hurt even though he had reached the capitol like an escaped convict under the disguise of a scotch cap and cloak and continued for days to * his visitors with an account of his ingenuity in eluding the supposed murderous snare which had been set for him leaving his wife and children however with true yankee chivalry to encounter the dreadful fate from which he so * described himself as having escaped nobody hurt and yet this same unconstitutional president pursues his evening drive under escort of an armed guard which quite takes us back to the feudal ages the sight pleased me i confess as a * of the gathering tempest i wish i could present to the minds eye a picture of washington as it really appeared under the desecration of the black republican rule those of its former population who remained from necessity or other causes had disappeared entirely from the surface of society a new people had taken their places as distinct and marked in their characteristics as any * race that ever * christendom and who in their insolent pride of conquest speedily effaced every landmark of civilisation the city was filled to overflowing with greedy adventurers seeking office day after day and month after month the resistless tide with black glazed carpetbag in hand came rolling in i sometimes thought them the lost tribes of israel who * from afar the golden harvest had pierced the confines of eternity and found their way over every thoroughfare every public building doorway and corridor and steps were blocked up by these sturdy beggars who came to demand the spoils of victory and who * the accommodation of hotel or * ate their meals out of those same black glazed * on the highways or byways and slept like dogs in a kennel add to all this the thousands of drunken demoralised soldiers who filled the streets crowding women into the gutters with * and * observations and sometimes with more personal insult it was even difficult to look from the windows without the sense of decency being shocked and the public squares which were once such favourite * had now become the chosen places of * and crime the schools throughout the city had been closed as it was no longer safe for children to go into the street upon no class of the community did this total abnegation of all the laws both human and divine tell with such * effect as upon the free coloured population especially the women whose sober industrious habits of former days had given place under the influence of the new order of things to the most unbridled * and who were to be seen at all public places * in gorgeous attire sharing the smiles of the volunteer officers and soldiers with the republican dames and demoiselles i have frequently received the answer when i have sent to demand the services of a negro * that she would not come for the reason that she had an engagement to drive or walk with a yankee officer i will gladly turn from the contemplation of this * picture to the comedy of high life below stairs being enacted at the white house mrs lincoln disregarding or more probably being ignorant of the conventional usages which have from time immemorial regulated the etiquette at the presidential mansion created much amusement and ridiculous comment upon the first public occasion after the assumption of her new dignity in the reception of the ladies of the diplomatic corps the custom at washington is precisely similar to that practiced at all other courts that as soon after the * of a new chief as is practicable the representatives of foreign nations accredited to the government should be formally introduced by the secretary of state and a complimentary address delivered in their behalf by the * or oldest member of the diplomatic body which is answered by the president all being arranged beforehand even to the exchange of the addresses in like manner the ladies of the diplomatic corps after due notification are presented to the feminine representative of the white house this ceremony is always regarded as one of importance second only to a presentation at st jamess or st cloud the ladies in question after due notification presented themselves en grande * at the white house where they were ushered very unceremoniously into one of the * and left in a most uncomfortable state of uncertainty as to the next step in the programme after some time and when speculation had well nigh exhausted itself a young woman dressed in a pink wrapper and tucked petticoat came bounding in not making however the slightest recognition of the presence of the distinguished visitors assembled but stood balancing herself first on one foot and then the other surveying them meanwhile with a most * air and after having gratified her curiosity withdrew with as little ceremony as she had entered the surprised enquiry of the stranger ladies is this mrs lincoln had scarcely subsided when a small * woman with artificial flowers in her hair appeared the first idea was that she was a servant sent to make excuses for the singular delay of mrs lincoln but she approached and addressed herself in conversation to the wife of a secretary of legation and it gradually dawned upon the part that this was the feminine representative of the black republican royalty and they made the best of the awkward situation mrs lincoln herself however not seeming to be aware that everything was not conducted in the most orthodox fashion had instructed a little lady to inform mme * that she was studying french and would by winter be able to converse with her in that language by this she has probably discovered that there is no royal road to learning i had a most graphic description of this scene from more than one of the victims of this first republican court ceremony and only wish that i could give the picture with all its nicer touches the young lady in the tucked petticoat was a niece of mrs lincoln owing to the fact of mr seward being master of the ceremonies mr lincoln was a little less bizarre in his ministerial reception but at the dinner given in honour of the occasion when the different wines were served and he was asked which he would take he turned to the servant with most touching simplicity and said i dont know which would you this anecdote is as well authenticated as the * of the cup of tea on mrs * gown a distinguished diplomatist in discussing the merits of the illustrious pair said he is better than she for he seems by his manner to * for being there president harrison is said on his deathbed to have instructed the barber who * him to carry out the provisions of the constitution and president lincoln much to the chagrin of his constitutional advisers was in the habit of discussing matters of equal importance with his servants or helps as he termed them mrs lincoln asserted with great energy her right to a share of the distribution of the executive patronage she had received as a present from a man named * a magnificent carriage and horses promising him in return the * of the district of columbia one of the most lucrative offices in the gift of the executive mr lincoln had however determined to bestow the office upon another applicant who had also paid his * and who was in attendance waiting to receive the commission which was being made out mrs lincoln came into the presidents office asked what commission it was that he was signing and on being told seized it from his hands tore it in pieces saying that she had promised it to * and he should have it else her name was not mary lincoln * of course received the commission and the discomfited applicant reported this conjugal scene and from that hour commenced the system of * offerings at the shrine of mrs lincoln it had been a custom at washington to distribute the hay and grass cut from the public grounds to the poor and meritorious population of the city it was a cheap and graceful charity on the part of the government duly appreciated by the recipients for thus aided many a poor widow was enabled to buy bread for her children from the proceeds of milk from her cow mrs lincoln put a stop to this praiseworthy custom and claimed it as one of her perquisites commonplace and vulgar as these incidents may seem they are however useful illustrations of the practical application of william m * famous * to the victors belong the spoils the anecdotes of queen * of * present more clearly the character and degree of civilisation of the people over whom she reigned than any laboured historical effort could have done and no one would dream of describing a royal banquet amongst the * * and omit the cold bishop on the * the digression in the last chapter has drawn me from my purpose of telling how i became a prisoner of state september the 6th was the first time since that eventful period that i had had access to pen and paper all * having been hitherto withheld from me by order of the heads of the war and state departments and as i knew not at what hour the act of grace might be * i felt inclined to make the most of it as i have said on friday august 23 1861 as i was entering my own door on returning from a promenade i was arrested by two men one in citizens dress and the other in the fatigue dress of an officer of the united states army this latter was called major allen and was the chief of the detective police of the city they followed close upon my footsteps i had stopped to enquire after the sick children of one of my neighbours on the opposite side of the street from several persons on the sidewalk at the time en * i derived some valuable information amongst other things it was told me that a guard had been stationed around my house throughout the night and that i had been followed during my promenade and had probably been allowed to pursue it unmolested from the fact that a distinguished member of the diplomatic corps had joined me and accompanied me to that point this caused me to observe more closely the two men who had followed and who walked with an air of conscious authority past my house to the end of the pavement where they stood surveying me i continued my conversation apparently without noticing them remarking rapidly to one of our humble agents who passed those men will probably arrest me wait at * corner and see if i raise my handkerchief to my face give information of it the person to whom this order was given went whistling along i then put a very important note into my mouth which i destroyed and turned and walked leisurely across the street and ascended my own steps a few moments after and before i could open the door the two men above described rapidly ascended also and asked with some confusion of manner is this mrs greenhow i answered yes they still hesitated whereupon i said who are you and what do you want i come to arrest you by what authority the man allen or * for he had several * said by sufficient authority let me see your warrant he * something about verbal authority from the war and state departments and then both stationed themselves upon either side of me and followed into the house i rapidly glanced my eye to see that my signal had keen understood and remarked quietly i have no power to resist you but had i been inside of my house i would have killed one of you before i had submitted to this illegal process they replied with evident trepidation that would have been wrong as we only obey orders and both have families this scene occurred in much less time than is requisite to describe it i took a rapid survey of the two men and in that instant decided upon my own line of conduct for i knew that the fate of some of the best and bravest belonging to our cause hung upon my own coolness and courage by this the house had become filled with men who also surrounded it outside like bees from a hive the calmness of desperation was upon me for i recognised this as the first step in that system of infamy which was yet to hold up this nation of * to the scorn of the civilised world this was the first act of the new copartnership of seward mclellan co the strategic step on coming into power of the young general so * an attack upon women and children and a brilliant earnest of the laurels to be won on his march to richmond i asked after a few moments survey of the scene what are you going to do to search allen replied i will facilitate your labours and going to the mantel i took from a vase a paper dated manassas july 23 containing these words * * compliments to mrs r greenhow well but * the rest of the letter being torn off before it reached me some ten days before through the city postoffice i suspected its delicate mission so kept it from an instinct of caution and had shown it to major * of u s a captain richard cutts wilson of massachusetts and several others i threw it to allen saying you would like to finish this job i suppose he took it * however the city envelope in which i had received it my cool and indifferent evidently disconcerted the whole party they had expected that under the influence of the agitation and excitement of the trying position i should have been guilty of some womanly indiscretion by which they could profit an * search now commenced throughout my house men rushed with frantic haste into my chamber into every sanctuary my beds drawers and * were all upturned soiled clothes were * upon with avidity and mercilessly exposed papers that had not seen the light for years were dragged forth my library was taken possession of and every scrap of paper every idle line was seized even the torn fragments in the * or other * were carefully gathered together by these latterday lincoln * my library be it remembered was my sanctum it was there also that i gave lessons to my children many of whose unlettered * were tortured into dangerous correspondence with the enemy i was a keen observer of their clumsy activity and resolved to test the truth of the old saying that the devil is no match for a clever woman i was fully advised that this extraordinary proceeding might take place and was not to be caught at a disadvantage i had received a note a few days before stating that one of mclellans aides had informed a lady in george town that i was to be arrested also that the name of the honourable william preston u s minister plenipotentiary to spain who was at that time in washington stood in the * list he was warned by me in time to effect his escape meanwhile i was a prisoner in one of my own parlours not allowed to move with stern eyes fixed upon my face to read certainly what they did not find for although * anxieties filled my soul i was apparently careless and sarcastic and i know * in the extreme my servants were subjected to the same surveillance and were not allowed to approach me every effort was made to keep my arrest a secret my house * was quiet as usual three sides of it being surrounded by a high wall screened the guard from observation it was considered the headquarters of the secessionists and i being regarded as the head of the conspirators at washington a rich haul was anticipated they reckoned without their host this time in despite of all their wisely taken precautions the news of my arrest rapidly spread at eleven oclock i was taken prisoner at about three oclock my young friend miss mackall and her sister came to make * she had heard it in the city as she entered she was rudely seized by the detective who stood concealed behind the door and pushed forward as was also her sister they were terrified at the sight of the rude lawless men who were in possession of my once peaceful quiet home the dear * girl put her head on my shoulder and wept for she said i did not know what they had done with you i whispered oh be courageous for we must * these fiends but before i had succeeded in completely reassuring her the detective called captain dennis approached and in a loud authoritative voice demanded her name and residence as well as that of her sister we were all after this ordered to return to the back parlour under escort of this captain dennis whose duty for the time was to watch me the work of examining my papers had already commenced it was indeed a hard struggle to remain a quiet spectator of this proceeding but i nevertheless nerved myself to the task as my object was to throw the detectives off their guard i had no fear of consequences from the papers which had as yet fallen into their hands i had a right to my own political opinions and to discuss the question at issue and never shrank from the avowal of my sentiments i am a southern woman born with revolutionary blood in my veins and my first crude ideas on state and federal matters received consistency and shape from the best and wisest man of this century john c calhoun these ideas have been strengthened and matured by reading and observation freedom of speech and of thought were my * guaranteed by our charter of liberty the constitution of the united states and signed and sealed by the blood of our fathers mr calhoun had been the intimate friend of my husband and often our guest having remained several months at a time with us during his senatorial sojourn at washington for many years i had been honoured by a correspondence with him and it was my privilege to sit by his bedside and minister to his wants during his last illness and to treasure in my heart his words of wisdom and when he died i followed his remains as one of his children to his last restingplace the senatorial committee of arrangements of which our honoured commissioner to england mr mason was one having assigned me that position in the solemn pageant mr webster walked by my side as we turned from the tomb and with tears trickling down his face made use of these words one of earths * hath departed the purest best and greatest man i ever knew he was a roman senator when rome was the same expression he had used in his eloquent oration of the morning mr clay in his eulogy upon him in the senate at the same time said he was my senior in everything but years after the examination of my papers by seymour the most respectable and the only educated man amongst those detectives he said well madam you have no reason to feel anything but pride and satisfaction at the ordeal you have gone through for there is not a line amongst your papers that does not do you honour it is the most extensive private correspondence that has ever fallen under my examination and the most interesting and important there is not a distinguished name in america that is not found here there is nothing that can come under the charge of treason but enough to make the government dread and hold you as a most dangerous adversary but to return to the sad relation of my wrongs the search still went on i desired to go to my chamber and was told that a woman was sent for to accompany me it did not even then flash upon my mind that my person was to be searched i was however all the more anxious to be free from the sight of my captors for a few moments so * the pretext of change of dress c as the day was intensely hot after great difficulty and thanks to the slow movements of these agents of evil i was allowed to go to my chamber and then resolved to accomplish the destruction of some important papers which i had in my pocket even at the expense of life the papers were my cipher with which i corresponded with my friends at manassas and others of equal importance happily i succeeded without such a fearful sacrifice the detective dennis little dreamed that a few paces only stood between him and eternity he rapped at my door calling madam madam and afterwards opened it but seeing me apparently legitimately employed he withdrew had he advanced one step i should have killed him as i raised my revolver with that intent and so steady were my nerves that i could have balanced a glass of water on my finger without * a drop shortly after the female detective arrived i blush that the name and character of woman should be so * but she was certainly not above her honourable calling her image is * on my mind and as it is an ugly picture i would willingly * it as is usual with females employed in this way she was decently arrayed as if to impress me with her respectability her face reminded me of one of those indiarubber dolls whose expression is made by squeezing it with weak grey eyes which had a faculty of weeping like all the detectives she had only a christian name ellen i began to think that the whole * hospital had been let loose for my benefit well i was ushered into my chamber a detective standing on guard outside of the door to receive the important documents believed to be secreted on my person nothing less i suppose than a commission of brigadiergeneral from president davis upon the principle that whereas president lincoln had conferred that distinguished grade upon many who deserved to be old women president davis had with characteristic * discovered qualities in a woman equally entitled to reward i was allowed the poor privilege of * my own garments which one by one were received by this * and carefully examined until i stood in my linen after this i was permitted to resume them with the * as my * during all this time i was cool and selfpossessed i had resolved to go through the trying ordeal with as little triumph to my persecutors as possible i had already taken the resolution to fire the house from garret to cellar if i did not succeed in destroying certain papers in the course of the approaching night for i had no hope that they would escape a second days search my manner was therefore assumed to cover my intentions i was also sustained by the conscious rectitude of my purpose and the high and holy cause to which i had devoted my life i felt that a people struggling to maintain their rights and to transmit unimpaired to their children the glorious heritage of revolutionary fathers was under the protection of that divine overruling providence which could carry me * across the burning * spread for my destruction with this conviction in my soul i resigned myself to the law of the strongest for i knew not what further trials were in store for me the orders were to entrap everybody who called at my house miss mackall and her sister were already in * mrs mackall who came in pursuit of her children was seized and detained as also several other casual visitors i know not in fact how many were taken into custody for as the evening advanced i was ordered upstairs accompanied by my friends a heavy guard of detectives being stationed in the rooms with us a little later i had reason to regard it as a signal act of divine mercy that those friends were sent me as i have said it was believed that all the secessionists in the city were in communication with me so everyone who called black or white was viewed as an emissary a former * of mine and his sister in passing the house were made prisoners the man was confined below stairs and the young girl taken into the parlour with only those brutal men as her companions i was not aware of her being in the house until startled by a smothered scream my first idea was that some insult had been offered to my maid but being satisfied on that point i tried to believe that my sense of hearing had deceived me still i could not * myself of the horrible fear and after a while succeeded in sending some one down the girl was found in a state of great alarm from the rudeness to which she had been exposed and was sent below to her brother and i now began fully to realise the dark and gloomy perils which environed me the chiefs of the detectives having gone out several of the subordinates left in charge now possessed themselves of rum and brandy which aided in developing their brutal instincts and they even boasted in my hearing of the nice times they expected to have with the female prisoners as every evil is said to be checkmated by some corresponding good i was enabled by this means to destroy every paper of consequence i had placed them where they could be found by me at any hour of the day or night and was not slow to avail myself of the state of * in which the guards were plunged stealing noiselessly to the library in the dark i mounted up to the * shelf took from the leaves of a dusty * papers of immense value to me at that moment concealing them in the folds of my dress and returned to my position on the bed without my gaolers having missed me the papers were much more numerous than i imagined and the difficulty was how to dispose of them the chance of my friends being searched on going out as they were assured they should do at three oclock made me hesitate as to that method i remembered however that in the search of my person in the morning my boots and stockings had not been removed so miss mackall concealed the papers in her stockings and boots this proceeding of course occupied some time but it was noiselessly accomplished in the presence of the guard it was agreed between miss mackall and myself that if after leaving my room she learned that her person would be searched she should be seized with * at leaving me and return to share the honours of the conflagration it is proper here to state that the mother of miss mackall was not * of this or any other circumstance calculated to have involved her in the difficulties surrounding me the guard meanwhile all unconsciously continued their conversation which under the influence of the ardent spirits they had imbibed became heated and angry i exerted myself to promote the discussion and arrayed their different * one against the other they were english german irish and yankee i reasoned that so unusual a circumstance as men wrangling in my house would warn my friends of the existence of an extraordinary state of things it was a clear moonlight night and fear like death had hushed every sound in that section of the city it was a judicious conclusion as i subsequently learned i must here record a circumstance which will go far to prove that a certain gentleman in black does not always take care of his own the chief detective allen having gone out on some other errand of mischief on returning about nine oclock encountered a gentleman who was at that time provostmarshal of the city and who was about to call to make a visit at my house allen being ignorant of or disregarding his official position attempted to arrest him he ran pursued by allen until he reached the * quarters when ordering out his guard he arrested allen and held him in close confinement until the next morning regardless of his oaths or his prayers to be allowed to send a message to lincoln or seward or mclellan by these indirect means providence seems to have watched over and averted destruction from me between the hours of three and four on the morning of the 24th my friends were permitted to depart under escort of a detective guard who were stationed around their houses for the following day after this i was allowed to snatch a few hours of repose much needed after the mental and bodily fatigue of that most trying day but i must also state that the two doors leading into my chamber were kept open with a guard stationed inside of each on the morning of the 24th at about eleven oclock my friend miss mackall much to the surprise of the yankee detective police returned and for several weeks shared my imprisonment for seven days my house remained in charge of the detective police the search continuing throughout all that time as also the examination of my papers and correspondence the books in the library were all taken down and examined leaf by leaf there would have been some wisdom in this the first day several large boxes containing books china and glass which had been packed for several months were subjected to the like ordeal finally portions of the furniture were taken apart and even the pictures on the walls received their share of attention also my beds even were upturned many times as some new idea would seize them i now watched their clumsy proceedings free from anxiety as i had under their own eyes sent off or destroyed all my papers of value the search still went on my powers of observation became quickened to a degree which would have made me a valuable * to the honourable body to whose care the abolition government had confided the lives and honour of helpless women and children seemingly i was treated with deference once only were violent hands put upon my person the detective captain dennis having rudely seized me to prevent my giving warning to a lady and gentleman on the first evening of my arrest which i however succeeded in doing and as the birds escaped his snare his rage grew beyond bounds and he seized me with the spring of a tiger and crushed my poor arm which long bore the marks of the brutal outrage the story of the hapless queen of scots was most feelingly called to my recollection a strong effort was afterwards made to drive this from my mind as if aught but the lifes blood of the * could efface it my orders were asked for my meals which i * as one of the necessities of my situation but lily and i were like the siamese twins inseparable my pistol had been taken from me and i had no means of defence and for the first time in my life i was exposed to the dread of personal violence i had however the satisfaction after a few days of perceiving that even my lawless captors were rebuked into more quiet and reserve before me although they still presumed to seat themselves at table with me with * hands and shirtsleeves the tactics of my gaolers changed many times occasionally it seemed that my confinement was only nominal all this of course was to throw me off my guard the subordinates threw themselves in my way as if disgusted with the task assigned them and with hearts overflowing with kindness and hands ready to be bribed * most fluently upon the outrage committed in my arrest two deserve especial notice one was a burly irishman with smooth tongue professing the religion of my ancestors that of the holy catholic faith he marvelled that so noble a lady should have been treated as a common * and by way of still further showing his sympathy he set himself to the task of making love to my maid hoping by this means to possess himself of the important state secrets of which he believed her to be the repository sentimental walks and treats at * at uncle * expense were a part of the programme she * * a * irish girl warmly attached to me as a kind mistress and knowing nothing which the severest scrutiny could * to my disadvantage entered keenly into the sport and to use her own expressive words led pat a dance and under these new auspices performed some very important * for me the other a * * whom they called robert * with tears in his eyes upon the sublime fortitude i had exhibited on this my moral gridiron and seeking still further to commemorate the meek and lowly grace with which i had borne myself asked me to present him with mclellans report on the crimea with my autograph for he said madam choked with emotion there is no telling what may happen and i would like to look at your name and know that you had forgiven me his manner was touchingly pathetic and very like what i should suppose jack * to be on asking for the black cap after all was over these two men offered to take letters for me i learned incidentally that the provostmarshals office was kept on the qui vive by the daily report of these proceedings from which important results were expected to be derived during all this time i was never alone for a moment wherever i went a detective followed me if i wished to lie down he was seated a few paces from my bed if i desired to change my dress or anything else it was obliged to be done with open doors and a man peering in at me that every sense of delicacy recoiled from this indecent exposure may well be imagined but alas i had no alternative but to submit for when i remonstrated with the detective captain dennis i was met by the answer that it was the order of the provost marshal and that i was indebted to him that more disgusting severity had not been enforced general mansfield had been superseded in the position of provostmarshal of the district of columbia by brigadier andrew j porter who was far more congenial in his character and acquirements with the * and his * and not likely to entertain any conscientious scruples in the performance of any duty which might be assigned to him and who seemed to have been equally fortunate in the selection of his own principal * captain averil of the usa whose genius certainly lay in his new line of duty he was ever on the alert to discover some new persecution for the unfortunates within his power in order to testify his zeal and fidelity meanwhile my private papers and letters were still under the process of examination and were divided off into parcels marked highly important political legal c according to the * faculty of the examining parties and borne off to the war department there was one paper amongst them which i venture to assert will never be brought to light it was a full and detailed account so far as could be collected of the appalling attempt of the abolition party to poison president buchanan and the chiefs of the democratic party in washington at the national hotel a few days prior to the inauguration of president buchanan this diabolical scheme was very near accomplishment so far as regarded the life of president buchanan who was for a long time in a very critical condition and it was only by the use of powerful stimulants that his constitution rallied from the effects of the poison he told me that often during the day at this time he was obliged to drink several * of unadulterated brandy to keep himself from entire physical exhaustion this created great commotion in washington and various efforts were made to account for it in a natural way one story was that the rats which were very troublesome had been poisoned and that they had fallen into the * which supplied the hotel with water but the corporate authorities took the matter in hand and instituted a very thorough examination the * were all emptied of water and no rats could be found the * under and leading through the town were also opened to see if any poisonous * could come from them and the corporation reported that there was no local cause for the epidemic everybody fled from the * spot and the hotel which was one of the largest in the city was closed at the same time information of a very important character came to the knowledge of the authorities a * of philadelphia wrote to the attorneygeneral caleb cushing at washington that in his absence an order had been received and filled by one of his subordinates for thirty pounds of * to be sent to washington that so unusual a quantity had excited his alarm that upon further enquiry he learned that the express charge had been * at philadelphia for its transportation which was likewise unusual it was also found that the package had reached washington by adams * express and had been called for and received by some unknown party to show the pertinacity with which the plot was followed up congress had made an appropriation for a * of the white house with a salary of # the person who had charge of mr buchanans rooms at the national was the applicant for the post and was on the eve of receiving the appointment when a gentleman from new york arrived in post haste in the night roused up the private secretary of the president and gave him information of importance the applicant for the place of * of the white house after this did not again present himself but disappeared from the city judge black the attorneygeneral of the united states under mr buchanan whose statements corroborated the above information told me also that he had obtained a clue to the whole plot but that mr buchanan would not allow the affair to be pursued because of the startling facts it would lay open to the world and that he shrank from the terrible exposure i considered it a great weakness on his part to have forbidden the investigation as it might have averted the john brown raid and many other acts of the irrepressible conflict party between fifty and sixty persons fell victims to this wholesale poisoning experiment a very large sum had been offered for my cipher this extraordinary sum had stimulated the zeal of the * of the government to a very remarkable degree i had of course too much control over myself to afford any indication of my knowledge of what they were seeking but affected ignorance and * the tables were filled with fragments of old letters and scraps in cipher in several languages from early morn till late at night for seven days they puzzled over them i had no fear one by one they had allowed the clue to escape them and for what remained * himself would have required a key only once was i frightened miss mackall who like myself was always on the alert abstracted from a heap of papers a sheet of blotting paper upon which was the whole of my despatch to manassas on july 16 another evidence that providence watched over me as an humble instrument in a glorious cause i was at this time kept perfectly well posted with regard to matters outside and sometimes received valuable information through the * conversation of my gaolers i had been already notified that several of my despatches had been betrayed into sewards hands by a spy of the name of * that a cabinet council had been convened assisted by scott and mclellan and that several republican officials had been summoned amongst the number wilson of massachusetts as being implicated by my information the despatches created consternation the whole abolition government were at this time shaking with fear of the advance of our glorious army and their children were even hushed to sleep with the cry jeff davis is coming i had deemed it important that the political intrigues then going on at washington should be clearly understood by the confederate government and as i might almost be said to have assisted at lincolns cabinet councils from the facilities i enjoyed having verbatim reports of them as well as of the republican caucus i was thoroughly competent to the task of giving a faithful * of their deliberations one of the despatches referred to was a long letter to president davis describing in detail the intrigues to get rid of scott by the temporary elevation of mclellan in which was repeated a conversation i had held with several members of the new york press as an indication of the temper of the times upon a proposition they had under discussion of uniting to * seward and cameron and the reasons pro and con for leaving seward where he was that his * policy was less conducive to unity and strength that he would never inaugurate any net measures that if the faction which seemed strongest cried for the abolition of slavery or renewed guarantees for its protection he would lend himself to it or to anything else which could tend to his advancement that his genius lay in his faculty of drawing to himself all the advantages of any successful measure and of shuffling out of the way of an unpopular one that bennett of the new york herald had understood him perfectly and had said of him in reply to my remark that seward was the only statesman amongst the black republican party he has not the first principle of a statesman he is a miserable political * and has been the advocate of every unconstitutional measure in this state from * down to abolitionism he has not blood enough in him to entertain an honest opinion on any subject but wishes to be a great man and will buckle to anything for power that the chevalier * had gone to seward and repeated to him some portion of this conversation and that he seward had reddened to the roots of his hair but had appointed an hour to receive him for the discussing certain propositions he had to make on the part of the new york press on the peace question that the chevalier after this conversation came to me and proposed that i should give him a safeconduct to general beauregard with a recommendation that he would forward him to richmond from which city he could write a peace letter that mr seward favoured the idea he then said suppose you go to manassas and let me go under your protection i said that would be impossible he replied quickly oh i have arranged all that with seward i said you misunderstand me your reputation is so bad that no lady would travel in your company that * by this he then said but will you give me a letter which will take me through to richmond i will be willing to go blindfold and be put in a cage after i get there so that i may write the letter to which i replied i have no authority to grant your request and so far from giving you facilities for carrying out your wishes i should consider president davis * in his duty if he did not cause any man to be hanged who would do what you propose that peace now upon any other basis than separate independence was out of the question and that if he had any desire to aid in the accomplishment of that desirable end he had better through the new york papers endeavour to enlighten the minds of the people on the subject that we of the south had been driven to draw the sword in self defence c i told of camerons * which were not then generally known of mclellans plans for * the army in short of all that was proposed or being done by the yankees the second despatch was entirely in cipher but contained duplicate drawings of some fortifications and weak points which they complimented as being equal to those of their best engineers as well they might besides information of importance in case our army advanced on washington my letter was pronounced a very able production i had at least the satisfaction of knowing that lincoln and the assembled wisdom of abolitionism did justice to the zeal with which a southern woman executed her patriotic duty their fears elevated me to a most dangerous eminence and they deliberated whether i should not be publicly tried for treason and made an example of the effort to obtain my cipher was with the hope of establishing direct evidence against me such as would be available in court upon a public trial and as a justification to the world for their extraordinary proceedings for which there had been no precedent in a civilised age save in france during the revolution my social position was such that they did not dare follow the suggestions of their first excited consultations in disposing of me for in their own ranks i had many devoted friends who openly expressed their admiration of the position i took under the circumstances of danger and difficulty which environed me mr davis directed me in a despatch received at this time to give up the cipher if i could thereby obtain any advantage this discretionary instruction of the president left me free to follow my own judgment and destroy it for reasons vital to me and fraught with hazard to others actually engaged and still * my despatches were all written and received at this time under a * de plume and yankee cunning and ingenuity had even at this early day exhausted itself in efforts to * me into an admission or recognition which would compromise me or my friends they had had the infamy to * a report that for a large sum i had engaged to desert my cause and betray my party but i thank god that they did not succeed in shaking the confidence of my friends which was an important object that i could have made my own terms with them can easily be seen from the importance they attached to my capture they had the effrontery to insinuate to me through their subordinates that a graceful concession on my part would be most cheerfully responded to by the government and when i replied that if this was in * of the report they had set in circulation an attempt to bribe me my only response would be that for weal or woe i had cast my lot as god and nature directed and that their whole bankrupt treasury could not tempt me to betray the meanest agent of our cause i was asked if i knew that my life was in danger and that probably to save my neck i might answer differently to which i replied that the life of any one is in danger when in the power of lawless scoundrels beyond that i had no fears for their own cowardice protected me as they knew ample retaliation would follow an attempt on my life on thursday the 29th the yankee government went through the farce of offering to hire my house and furniture i asked to be allowed to see a lawyer for consultation and was told that they would not grant me that right i then answered that as a prisoner i was not competent to any legal act and that i declined all negotiations with them that they had already ruined and destroyed and stolen all that i valued in the house and that they might continue to hold it by the same lawless tenure that of brute force as i would not become a party to my own robbery this i said to quartermaster howard who came on the part of the government and to do him justice he appeared heartily ashamed of his mission general butler was with cameron and other officials in the provostmarshals office when captain howard went to report the result of his mission which he did in terms complimentary to me coupled with the remark that he felt like tearing the * from his shoulders from a sense of mortification at the part he was forced to play as he stood before the noble woman butler said if the government will take my advice and consign that haughty dame to my care at fortress monroe i warrant to put her through an ordeal which will no longer endanger the loyalty of our officers c c verily a roman tyrant made a consul of his horse but lincoln has exceeded him in enormity by making of butler the beast a military governor my object in seeing a lawyer was of course not with the idle hope of protecting my property but up to this time the habeas corpus had not been suspended and i wished to force the issue between the civil and military authorities as a means possibly of arresting the coming evils i was informed by the man allen that i knew my rights too well and that the government did not intend to afford me the means of asserting them i did however in spite of their vigilance succeed in sending a message and note to judge black late attorneygeneral of the united states and to the honourable r j walker requesting them to call upon me but those grave legal gentlemen influenced by prudential considerations or sympathy with the inquisitorial * gave no heed to my request and i was thus left in the hands of an unscrupulous cunning enemy with only my own judgment to guide me to show the utter recklessness of the abolition government and the extraordinary means they temporarily resorted to to infuse * into their demoralised ranks it was now * published that our great and good president had died in richmond a few weeks after the battle of manassas he was said to have died of a slow fever brought on by great mental anxiety and * at the share he was supposed to have had in bringing about the revolution that he had breathed his last sigh at twenty minutes to six in the morning that his attending physicians and family and friends were present that his mind was clear and that he solemnly exhorted his friends to renew their allegiance to the united states and to do all in their power to put down the revolution the * were reported to be at halfmast at arlington heights manassas and all other points in our possession and that minute guns were fired during the day this account went through the whole north and was the cause of immense rejoicing for our president had filled them with fear and dread in proportion to the confidence and veneration with which he had inspired every southerner on friday morning the 30th of august i was informed that other prisoners were to be brought in and that my house was to be converted into a prison and that miss mackall and myself and little girl and servant were to be confined in one room after considerable difficulty and consultation with the secretary of war another small room was allowed for my child and maid with the restriction however that i should not go into it as it was a front room with a window on the street subsequently my library was also allotted to me my parlours were stripped of their furniture which was conveyed into the chamber for the use of the prisoners by this time i had become perfectly callous everything showed signs of the * those unkempt * wretches the detective police had rolled themselves in my fine linen their mark was visible upon every chair and sofa even the chamber in which one of my children had died only a few months before and the bed on which she lay in her * had been desecrated by these emissaries of lincoln and the various articles of * which lay on her toilet as she had left them were borne off as rightful spoils every hallowed association with my home had been rudely blasted my castle had become my prison the law of the land had been supplanted by the higher law of the abolition despot and i could only say o lord how long will this iniquity be permitted but i stray from my story soon armed men filled the house the clank of whose muskets resounded through it like the voice of doom i was confined to my chamber at the door of which two soldiers stood musket in hand the commotion below told me that other prisoners were arriving they were the philips family mrs philips and her two oldest daughters and her sister miss * a silent greeting en * was all we were allowed to exchange these ladies had been arrested the day after i was and were subjected to the like if not greater indignities from which the presence of the husband and the father could not protect them and now they were dragged from their own homes the mother from her little children several of whom were infants of tender age her house ransacked her papers overhauled without finding anything to base even a suspicion upon the only circumstance against her really being that she was a southern woman and a lady scorning association with the * whom the * of the revolution had brought to the surface of society another prisoner was to be confined in the room adjoining mine a heavy bar of wood had been nailed across the door between so as to prevent all communication she was brought in late at night her deep and convulsed sobs broke on the stillness of the hour i sat by the door and heard the officer in charge call her name it was mrs hasler of whom i had some previous knowledge but had she been a stranger her hapless lot would have established a claim to my sympathy i had sent to this persons house the night of my arrest to warn her but found her house already in charge of soldiers and my messenger barely escaped arrest i was of course intensely anxious to let her know that she was in my house and to communicate with her she had been accredited to me as a reliable messenger by colonel * had successfully served in that capacity several times and it was through her means most innocently however that my despatches had been betrayed into the hands of the government special care was taken to prevent this prisoner and myself from communicating as they hoped through her to establish direct evidence against me the morning after her arrival i diverted the attention of the guard whilst miss mackall slipped into her room and warned her to deny all knowledge of me which was however limited to the fact of her having been an agent of communication poor woman she had been most * used dragged from her own lodgings to a * where she had been kept for a whole week lying on a dirty * without sheets or pillow amidst the lowest and most disgusting class of the community and her nervous system had been completely shattered by it all intercourse between the prisoners was interdicted had we been * to the condemned cell more rigorous measures could not have been enforced miss mackall was allowed to see her mother and sisters only in the presence of an officer intercourse thus restricted afforded but little pleasure still it was a link between us and the outer world which had not been appreciated at its full value until we were deprived of it it must not be supposed that i have related all the incidents which occurred in these first days under the eyes of the detective police i had received and answered despatches from my friends amongst them had been the order from my president to give up my cipher upon specified contingencies i am restrained by prudential considerations from mentioning many and where the parties only escaped by the stupidity of my gaolers the efforts of the black republicans had been persistently to make the term secessionist one of disgrace and reproach and although they had with great * courted the few southern families who remained there was no language too coarse for them to use in describing secessionists always of course assuming that the person addressed had too much selfrespect to be thus classified every social element was brought to bear against the unhappy southerner ties of blood and kindred were arrayed in dread hostility those who remained upon the abolition side affecting to think that their family * had been tarnished by the misguided members who advocated the southern cause and constitutional liberty no one suffered in this respect more than myself for many members of my immediate family * with the despot and held high official position under him the detective police who had hitherto had charge of me now gave place to the military guard selected from one of the volunteer companies the sturgis rifles who hitherto constituted mclellans bodyguard a lieutenant and twentyone men were detailed for this valorous duty the detective police on resigning their charge were very anxious that i should not be apprised of their true characters they had assumed to be officers of the united states regular army and deluded themselves with the idea that i had not discovered the wolf under the * clothing my wish had been to foster this delusion by every means in my power as i thereby gained some advantages and i very reluctantly allowed myself to be enlightened on the subject by some enthusiastic young officers who cherished the hallucination that honour still lingered under the old livery of the united states the officer in charge of my prison lieutenant sheldon was directed by captain averil usa chief of the provostmarshals corps to encourage me to write letters which were to be subjected to the inquisitorial examination of this fact i was however to be kept in ignorance to the honour of lieutenant sheldon he did not lend himself to the plot i availed myself however of the privilege of writing and have certainly to thank this most sagacious captain for having afforded me the means of communication i was at this time seized with a taste for * the colours necessary for its prosecution came to me through the provostmarshals office wound in balls with simply a memorandum by which i could always know the original arrangement of colours i had made a vocabulary of colours which though not a very prolific language served my purpose my letters above all things puzzled these wise men of the east who finally came to the conclusion that for a clever woman mrs greenhow wrote the greatest pack of trash that was ever read by way of justifying this opinion i will submit a specimen of my * efforts of course my versatility of mind was exercised to * the style and character of these * so as not to attract attention to them and i am glad to state that in this effort i was eminently successful miss mackall although not a prisoner was subjected to most of the restrictions in this house of bondage the freedom originally allowed her being as i rightly judged for the purpose of * others these clumsy * could not comprehend the sacrifices which a woman will make in the performance of a duty which * itself alike to her judgment and feelings i could have escaped the snare set for me but i should thereby have one great injury to our cause few would have ventured after such an example of timidity to furnish the necessary information or encounter the odium of being supposed to sympathise with the rebels i felt it to be my post of duty whatever danger threatened and that i at least would cast no reproach upon my party in going through the trying ordeal that every womans heart throughout the south would make my cause their own and that so far from * the knowledge that one of their sex was suffering for the same faith in the prisons of the tyrant would nerve the most timid to deeds of daring the idea of the yankees at first was to hold me up conspicuously before the eyes of the public as a terrible example and a warning in this they signally failed for i became even amongst their own people an object of interest and one of their own papers the new york times some months later said had madam greenhow been sent south immediately after her arrest as we recommended we should have heard no more of the heroic deeds of secesh women which she has made the fashion on the 7th of september my child was taken very ill in consequence i wrote to provostmarshal porter asking that my family physician might be allowed to visit her with characteristic humanity he refused and proposed to send me one of his own creatures whom i declined to receive preferring to trust her life to the care of the good providence which had so often * me a few days after a dr steward was introduced he was a vulgar uneducated man * with enough * for three * and endowed with a considerable degree of modest assurance he evidently expected by affected * to overcome my repugnance to his visits but he reckoned without his host for if my * had come to me under such auspices i should think that the devil had been * with him and refuse to receive him the routine of my * was constantly varied by some new device on the part of my captors to obtain legal evidence against me they had already subjected me to an ordeal little short of the celebrated question of the spanish inquisition by a total disregard of all the laws of decency every feeling of the woman had been shocked and outraged and they now sought to act upon my nervous system by dark insinuations and threats against my life and reputation my papers had been examined with a minuteness bordering upon the farcical letters were found from most of the gifted and great in our southern land whom they now branded as traitors copies of some of my own letters also both before and after lincolns illfated elevation expressing in earnest language my appreciation of the coming dangers and in some instances warning my correspondents to take time by the * these however added no link in the chain of evidence but only served to * in their eyes my mental i ability and consequent capacity to injure them and * their anxiety to convict me the despatches already in their hands and which had caused them to tremble even in the midst of their armed * at best would be but circumstantial evidence against me and my connection with these even would have to be established upon the testimony of that double spy * whom cameron had sent in that capacity to manassas under the pretext of obtaining the body of his brother and this man i could have proved to have been in the pay of our army and had furnished some valuable information mr seward in spite of the * of his * faculties retained enough of his legal * to know that in so grave a matter as trial for treason the charge must be sustained by two respectable witnesses and that any case made out against me upon the evidence before them would have been dismissed from every court in christendom i did not shrink from this trial and when repeatedly warned that it might take place said let it come i will claim the right to defend myself and there will be rich revelations the government having come to the sage conclusion that mrs hasler was one of my agents hoped through her credulity or fears to obtain additional testimony against me with this object the spy * was brought to see her she received him with unsuspecting confidence and drank in with greedy ears his marvellous tales he complained bitterly of having been searched and badly treated before he was allowed to see her and exhibited his torn hat in evidence his great object he said was to fall upon some plan of communicating with me as he had information of importance for me and asked her if she could communicate this programme had been all arranged at the provost marshals by general porter and his subordinate * captain averil being entitled to the suggestion of tearing the hat i had been warned of all this in advance but had not thought it advisable to * mrs hasler of it she could not commit herself further to this man than she had already done neither had i any apprehensions concerning myself as she knew nothing having simply acted as agent on several occasions for the transmission of despatches of the purport of which she was as ignorant as the mail boy of the contents of his bag it was proposed to confront this worthy agent with me but his own fears rendered * every effort of this kind he lived in mortal dread of his life and when a friend of mine went to see him in order to obtain for me some information he found him * in his room with a pistol lying on either side of him he soon after left the city lest he should pay the penalty of his crimes this incident as well as others which had preceded it will convince the abolitionists that although they held me in close confinement my system of espionage was more perfect than their own this dr stewart was i fancy destined to be my * * he said that he was ordered by provost marshal porter to make a daily inspection of my sanitary condition his vanity was enlisted in this he wished to be able to say in the course of his morning rounds i have just been to see the rebel prisoner mrs greenhow and she says so and so i had no idea of permitting this and therefore told him that i did not desire to receive his professional visits as i was perfectly well c he wrote a prescription for miss mackall in english every word of which was * and signed himself * * i laughingly mentioned the circumstance of a physicians writing a prescription in other than latin by some means my remarks reached him so on the repetition of his visit on the following day he addressed me with good morning mistress greenhow is there anything * * can do for you today recalling forcibly to my mind the story of the irishman * * * then lend me the loan of a gridiron i now told * * that his visits were * on my privacy offensive to me and requested that they might be discontinued it will hardly be credited that after this i should have been subject to the annoyance again on the day succeeding he came in as usual with * effrontery not even * to knock at my door i took no notice of him but sent for lieutenant sheldon to take charge of my formal protest against the continuance of the outrage this he did making also verbal representations which relieved me from further sanitary inspection about this time a stable in the rear of my whilom home my prison caught on fire through the neglect of some drunken soldiers by whom it was occupied it created the wildest alarm the whole of the provostguard headed by captain averil rushed to the scene of action and surrounded the house the following morning the government organ contained an account of a very daring attempt at rescue of the rebel prisoners with a * against me personally of so resolute and desperate a character that it had to be repulsed at the point of the bayonet this * statement was concluded by a high compliment to the intrepidity and courage of captain averil for having defeated this imaginary effort to * justice which was furnished i was told by himself somewhere about the 8th of september honourable edwin m stanton accompanied by judgeadvocate colonel key came to see mrs philips and family to make arrangements for their being sent south on parole which was effected a day or two afterwards mr stanton came also to see me i had of course no idea of the position he was subsequently to hold in the abolition cabinet neither had he at that time after some preliminary conversation he asked me what i had done to bring down the wrath of the abolitionists upon my head i answered i had been guilty of * and hence my incarceration in fact that i knew not the charge and for the purpose of ascertaining it and forcing the government to a consideration of my case i now wished to employ him as my counsel to obtain a * of habeas corpus this he declined accompanied by expressions of high appreciation and proffer of service in any other way to which i of course attached no value i had previously applied to judge black attorneygeneral under mr buchanan and to the honourable * walker both of whom i had known intimately and this last effort convinced me that no northern man had the courage or the desire to attempt to stem the tide of northern usurpation which was destined to sweep like an avalanche over the land destroying civil liberty and establishing in its stead an irresponsible military despotism i felt now that i was alone and that the wall of separation from my friends was each hour growing more formidable a new grievance was also put upon me miss mackall who up to this time had remained with me was on the 25th of september abruptly taken away and all intercourse or communication with me interdicted so rigid had become the rules that persons were warned under penalty of arrest from walking or driving by the prison a * dogged eternally poor * footsteps which so harassed and annoyed her that she often prayed for the protection of her * wearily and heavily now passed the days and weeks another plan was also adopted to reduce me to submission my food which up to this time though plain and often * had been sufficiently abundant was now so reduced in quantity and quality as to be inadequate often to satisfy the * of hunger my child as well as myself suffered greatly under this new infliction i wrote to provostmarshal porter protesting against this inhumanity but he turned a deaf ear to my remonstrance and my little rose who was allowed to play on the pavement under escort of a guard was often indebted to the kind friends who sent her food whilst there that she should not cry herself to sleep from hunger those yankee descendants of the pilgrim fathers had improved upon the ancestral practice of burning and hanging and quartering their enemies by quartering and starving theirs an outrage was now perpetrated more foul more galling to me as a woman than any which had preceded it a woman of bad repute known and recognised by several of the guard as such having been seen in the streets of chicago in the exercise of her vocation calling herself mrs * was brought to my house and placed in the chamber of my deceased child adjoining mine for what object i know not but this woman was allowed unrestricted intercourse with me the order being given that our meals should be served together here again my thanks are due to lieutenant sheldon for so soon as the character of the woman became known to him he restricted her to her apartment in which she frequently received mr frederick seward * of state mr webster private secretary of the secretary of state and other persons officially connected with the government it might have been supposed that my former social position and that which members of my immediate family still held in the federal city would have protected me from this attempt to degrade me but surprise will cease when the character of this people has been exhibited more clearly and the unscrupulous and * influences brought by them to bear amidst the social relations of life exposed under the system established by mr seward of the secret police a spy was in every household these were often selected from the higher classes of society as witness mrs and mrs of baltimore and mme and mrs of washington city by such means the sanctity of home was invaded every unguarded expression uttered within its sacred precincts was sure to reach the ears of the secret police those * of america who less merciful than their eastern prototypes who warned their victims of their coming fate by a knife stuck in the wall entered the houses and the chambers of women and children at the dead of night dragging them from their beds and regardless alike of tears and prayers forced them to assume their garments under the eye and often amidst the * jests of their rude and * agents one young girl to my knowledge died from the shame and horror of this ordeal and yet this people with the deep * of their acts before them dare to proclaim their mission to be the upholding of the constitution and the restoration of the union i often wonder that the thunderbolts of heaven do not strike them as they utter the sacrilegious lie their leaders now in all private circles when they deemed themselves secure unblushingly announced their real determination to abolish slavery sedgwick of new york one of their most intelligent members of the lower house told me that he did not care a rush for the flag that that was a * for the ignorant and that if he thought that by this war the old union could be restored with its constitutional guarantees for slavery that he would not vote a dollar or a man no he said it was for universal emancipation his party fought and they were now strong enough to declare their true policy the honourable henry wilson said the country had been ruled long enough by southern aristocrats and that his party would enforce their principles at the point of the bayonet and as to maryland they had put the iron heel upon her and would crush out her boundary lines baker of oregon one of president lincolns most confidential advisers and united states senator said in a conversation which i held with him at the time of the pretended attempt to reinforce fort sumter in answer to a remonstrance of mine on the subject it is true a great many lives may be lost and we may not succeed in reinforcing fort sumter but the president was elected by a northern majority and they are now becoming dissatisfied and the president owes it to them to strike some blow by which he will make a united northern party * of rhode island said that if the rebellion could not be suppressed in any other way he was for the abolition of slavery as a certain means of reducing the south to a state of * i state these conversations and i might add many more to the list in order to show that even at this early day when the initiatory step in the revolution had scarcely been taken all affectation was thrown aside as to the real object of the war that of subjugation of the south by means of general emancipation of the slaves mrs hasler was at this time released upon taking the oath of allegiance and making a full confession of all she had done or knew i was heartily glad of it she had paid dearly for a momentary impulse her sympathy or connection with our cause being confined to the transmission of a few letters for this she was imprisoned two months in solitary confinement and it required the stern faith of the martyrs of old to withstand the ordeal of our lord abraham the first but even this was not done as an act of justice to the victim whose health had become seriously impaired but by the kindly exertions of a lady who exercised as * an influence over the wily secretary of war simon cameron as the celebrated madame du * did over the grandfather of louis * it would be impossible to record the daily hourly petty annoyances to which i was exposed every article of clothing which went to the * had to be examined by the corporal of the guard in presence of the officer of the guard upon one occasion the corporal of the guard on sending out some article of clothing for one of the prisoners neglected this duty for which he was tried degraded to the ranks with imprisonment for thirty days and loss of pay for three months thus it will be seen that whatever repugnance may have been felt by an officer in the performance of this task it was obligatory upon him by order of the provost marshal who seemed to have had some original ideas on the subject of the transmission of treasonable communications although none on the subject of decency the provostguard was set in commotion one day headed by captain averil on account of a sprig of jessamine having reached me without going through the usual examination the abolition government had been for some time amusing the minds of its credulous subjects with a new scheme for the annihilation of the south the greatest naval expedition since that of philip ii for the subjugation of england because good queen * turned a dull ear to his matrimonial scheme was being fitted out and regardless of lucky or unlucky * it was also called the great armada every invention of modern science was employed in arming and equipping this vast fleet so as to insure the greatest amount of death and devastation to our unhappy doomed southern land twenty thousand picked troops were sent as a part of the expedition and most terrible of all burnside was to command it going south to look for his hat and his boots which he had lost at manassas it would be idle to record the anxieties which possessed me as day by day i followed through the new york herald the progress of the preparation and final equipment and * of the men the destination of this formidable armada now became an affair of vast moment and i revolved in my mind the various means by which this essential information could be obtained accident favoured this thirst for knowledge better than any plan however well arranged could have done we are told that jove nods sometimes and mr secretary seward who in the morning is the most reticent man in the world admirably illustrating * famous axiom that language is given to conceal thought is after supper and under the influence of the generous gifts which the gods provide the most genial and confidential i have often had occasion to admire the * of his nature on these occasions and wondered if the judgment of the world was correct in * to him the character of a subtle schemer and tortuous * it was upon one of these festive occasions when the mind of the great statesman had become properly attuned and his thoughts soared above the sordid materialism which * his genius during the plodding * business hours that he addressed himself to the task of * a distinguished foreign representative whose views i am sorry to say were not dissimilar to his own as to the utter hopelessness of the southern cause and assuring him that in thirty days a favourite period of his the rebellion would be crushed out * this melancholy fact by describing in detail this invincible armada and the * course it was predestined to take this important information was conveyed to me by my little bird mayhap it was the bird sent out from the ark and did not return and now came back to me with better than the * i leave this as an * speculation but being satisfied by other means of the accuracy of the intelligence i lost no time in preparing one of those peculiar square despatches written in that cipher for which a very large amount had been offered and with a prayer to almighty god for its safe delivery committed it to my faithful bird and sent it across the waters to general beauregard to be forwarded to our great and good president at richmond i might describe if i chose the danger that my poor bird passed over and how it at one time took refuge in the * of the enemy and other things of startling interest but this would indicate the course of the * messenger and * the future i learned at this time that dr gwin formerly united states senator for california was in washington a prisoner although at large and i desired very much to communicate to him verbally some details which would have been useful to our government but which i did not dare write as it would have compromised the safety of a friend whose position was one of prominence under the yankee government i wrote a note to dr gwin stating this fact and that i could arrange with perfect safety a personal interview i laugh now at the description of the doctors terror on receiving my note and his earnest appeal for gods sake not to attempt to communicate with him for he was surrounded by the detective police c he had not learned that therein was his * to do seemingly impossible things the * gales had now set in and the wailing shrieking and howling of the tempest as it swept along fell on my ear like the soft cadences of sweet music the abolition feet had been a little too tardy in its movements to reap the full benefit of the * blast still it was considerably damaged several vessels being stranded a large number of horses and quantities of ordnance stores also were thrown overboard thereby causing considerable delay before the great armada finally set forth upon its * errand meanwhile my despatch reached richmond i was very much startled one day somewhere about the 1st of october at receiving a proposition from a yankee officer to aid in effecting my escape the first idea that flashed upon me was for i confess that my * of caution had been largely developed by the events of the last few months that this was a trick to * some of my friends or for the purpose of affording a pretext for conveying me to a northern prison whatever my suspicions were i deemed it politic to give no indications of them so i responded to the proposal as if i believed it made in good faith and opened communication with a friend on the subject warning my friend secretly however of my suspicions and giving instructions as to the programme to be followed all things worked admirably the real objects which i had in view and which i refrained from stating for reason that it might afford an imprudent indication having been effected i threw grave obstacles in the way of the accomplishment of the heroic feat and it was finally abandoned from seeming want of resolution on my part to undertake it i can hardly tell now how my time was passed i had gone through the heat of midsummer into the autumn the severity of my imprisonment increasing all the while my food so * that for days i had lived upon crackers and cheese i was not even allowed to take exercise in the yard and was * informed that a proposition was discussed as to whether my windows should not be nailed up so as to deprive me of light as a means of forcing me into the terms of the government during all this period i was shut out from all intercourse or communication with my friends the interdict was absolute no one was allowed to see me even the religious consolation which is accorded to the lowest criminal in the christian countries of europe was denied me several members of the holy catholic clergy applied to see me and were repulsed with great rudeness at the provostmarshals as being emissaries of satan and secesh i wrote to enquire whether the provostmarshal had made a wholesale compact with the devil by which my child and maid were to be given over to destruction as well as myself * him that there was no monopoly in contracts with the gentleman in black the system of corrupt monopoly of government contracts was at this time being loudly denounced and asking that the privilege might be accorded them of going to church this was granted for the ensuing sunday and occasionally afterwards but always under escort of a guard whose orders were to sit in the same pew and allow no communication with anyone one morning as i opened my * to pass to the library i saw the detective allen dragging an old lady up the stairs who had great difficulty in ascending even with his assistance it was the venerable mother of the martyr jackson and i honoured her grey hairs as being his mother more than if a diadem had circled her brow she was placed in the room adjoining mine the bar of wood having been removed after the last occupant left the guard however were not aware of this fact and i was amused as i heard the detective double the guard and order that no one was to communicate with the prisoner i cautiously opened the door between our apartments and mounted over a * which stood across the entrance she sprang forward at seeing one of her own sex i rapidly cautioned her by pointing to the door leading into the hall placed my finger on my lips and softly approached her when the venerable lady folded me in her arms and gave me the information which i have stated above as to who she was i then knelt at her feet and she rapidly poured into my ear tales of the outer world she told me that she had been dragged from her bed at midnight that she had been only allowed to throw a loose gown over her * and that even in the presence of her captors and was thus brought forth my heart bled to see this noble woman of eighty years subjected to such an ordeal but she proved herself worthy of being the mother of her brave son she recounted to me the heartrending history of his ruthless murder and how his body had been pinned to the floor by the demons and kept there for many hours for them to * over until his heartbroken wife with her own feeble hands dragged it forth for christian burial she told me also of the heroic deeds of our brave soldiers which filled my heart with pride and thankfulness and i bowed my head in her lap and said mother give me your blessing and the old matrons words of god bless you and give you sustaining strength my child seemed to inspire me with new courage for what was to come soon the officer of the guard returned the terrible bar was placed in the door and i did not again enjoy the privilege of speaking with the mother of jackson neither was i allowed to minister to her comfort she was kept in a room without fire or lights the weather being very cold until about twelve oclock at night when she was released jackson had been one of the first victims of this war of aggression he was a resident of alexandria va before the occupation of that city by the yankee forces a marauding party under ellsworth a new york * and * strayed into alexandria one morning about daylight when ellsworth seeing the virginia state flag floating from jacksons house detached himself from his party and rushed into the house to tear it down jackson was roused from sleep in time to kill the daring ruffian who had thus violated his rights and was himself murdered a short time afterwards under circumstances of great * by the remainder of the gang who then spread themselves through the city plundering and committing outrages upon women of respectability for this four of their number were condemned to be shot but their escape was subsequently * at by the authorities a few days after this a miss poole or stewart was brought in on the 16th day of november i received a visit from my sister mrs james madison cutts and my niece the honourable mrs stephen a douglass accompanied by colonel * usa the permit to see me making the presence of an officer during the interview obligatory and * it to fifteen minutes i had been so ruthlessly debarred communication with my kind that i had long since arrived at the conclusion that all human kindness had taken flight along with my brethren of the south and left this * city of washington with its unfortunate * at the mercy of the merciless abolitionists colonel * earnestly recommended my graceful submission to the government and kindly offered to * in my behalf with secretary seward i declined this amiable counsel and proffer of aid as inconsistent with my own feelings and * to my honour i had now been three months a prisoner with no charge preferred against me or reason assigned for the illegal act and i determined to address a respectful letter to mr seward the secretary of state on the subject hoping to obtain some * of a matter certainly of personal interest to me this i did on the 17th of november i also sent a copy of this letter to my friends at manassas with no idea or intention however of its ever being given to the public and i confess that at first i was deeply chagrined at the circumstance but when i afterwards knew the anger and annoyance of the abolitionists at having the secrets of their * laid bare i became perfectly satisfied of the superior wisdom of my friends in giving it publicity as a part of my story i * the letter the contest between the different divisions of the abolitionists for the spoils was now carried on with quite as much heat and bitterness as had ever characterised the discussions of the two great sectional parties upon the vital questions of constitutional rights mclellan had been brought forward as a necessary expedient for the removal of scott without any idea however of * him permanently upon the party but he had taken root amidst the less ultra portions of it and from having been a * in the first place now stood defiantly at the head of a party of his own who * supported his pretensions the abolition government did not however at this time desire to crush they merely wished to * the wings of the * they had hatched to prevent his * too high his mission had been only half accomplished general scott although virtually suspended from all power still stood legally as lieutenantgeneral of the republic and commander * of its armies their * and slights had alike failed in inducing him to retire he still held on his vanity in some degree blinding him to the humiliation of his position nominally commanderinchief he merely served to * the war councils by the exercise of * undoubted prerogative that of * or approving military measures and he had the mortification of seeing his recommendations very generally disregarded which was the more remarkable from the fact of their being always of the most aggressive character towards the south general scott never having forgiven that section for rejecting him as their candidate for president in 1853 the state of irritation in which he was kept at this time brought on a prolonged attack of the gout and the scenes which often took place were described as * tragical for the younger officers who were obliged to approach him officially he had in reality no friends his arbitrary manner had chilled the growth of affection even in his days of power and those who had endured his arrogance for personal advantage now that his star was set addressed themselves to other patrons and the old hero who had borne himself * on a hundred battlefields but who had at last * the glory of his proud deeds by * himself under the abolition banner to trample under foot human rights was now reaping the bitter fruits in the contempt and indignity of the party for whom he had * his birthright * celebrated monologue was doubtless often recalled to his memory for truly in his extremity had he been left to the mercy of his enemies the political cauldron at washington at this time presented a curious spectacle fremont had already been brought forward as a rival to mclellan he was supported by the more violent of the abolitionists with francis p blair as his * who skilled in all the * of political intrigue was admirably adapted to the position and perhaps was the only living man who could have * fremont from the condition of obscurity into which he had * after his defeat as the republican candidate for president in 1857 whilst the feud raged with all imaginable bitterness between the friends of the different partisan chiefs mclellan was devoting himself with a zeal worthy of a better cause to the task of producing and * an army out of the * elements at his command and i often looked on with sickening heart at the energy and talent displayed by him in surmounting the difficulties which beset him in the performance of his herculean labours it has been long since determined as the first great rule for a commander that he should acquaint himself thoroughly as to the capabilities of his army it was this knowledge of his subordinates which distinguished napoleon above all others and mclellan seems in this instance to have been guided by the example of this illustrious man and to have studied well the motley mass composing the grand army his conclusion was not very flattering for he decided that their nervous organisation was incompatible with bayonet charges and handtohand encounters hence he decided to make the war hereafter an artillery duel as the only chance of success against the daredevil southern chivalry who were born to the use of arms to this end he devoted all his energy and influence the workshops of the north were set in motion and science and skill were employed to construct the most terrible projectiles and guns of largest range and all for the purpose of forcing upon the * rebels the blessings of fraternal intercourse perhaps never before in the world was so large an amount of ammunition destroyed in reviews sham battles and royal salutes it was however a military necessity to * the men as well as the horses to stand fire scarcely one of these martial games went off without some accident resulting in the loss of life from the * use of the terrible playthings intense satisfaction was however felt that the rebels had not these scientific adjuncts and in the next engagement would be hors de combat i speak ex * on this head as i had the good fortune of having had minutes of mclellans private consultations and often extracts from his notes mr seward at this time certainly established his claim to be considered the most adroit schemer of the day and possessed in a rare degree the faculty of making the passions and prejudices of others * his own ends this was demonstrated his skilful management of the two great parties who were contending for military supremacy his sliding scale was so admirably adjusted that it was difficult to determine which party he favoured and the truth was he really attached himself to neither no principle of his was involved in the fanatical crusade only * ambition and whichever party was likely to be the strongest with that party will he ultimately throw himself his * of caution was also largely developed he had raised the whirlwind and he wished to shelter himself from the dangers of the irrepressible conflict until its fury had been spent the state department with its myriads of secret police was a safe * for the time being as from thence he could * the trade of the assassin or highway robber without paying the penalty of his crimes for by the tinkling of that little bell at the state department the citizen north east or west was at his mercy who will question the wisdom of the south if even at the price of blood she resisted this unholy usurpation besides if these measures should afterwards prove to have been unwise and likely to interfere with any ulterior policy which the chapter of accidents might * or political expediency recommend he had always the * for a scapegoat as he of course was only acting by poor lincolns orders who by the way was still under the tutelage of this man of varied parts learning the polite usages of society the last vestige of civil and constitutional rights had been swept away the habeas corpus was suspended throughout the dominions of abraham the first and the opinion of the venerable chief justice taney that eminent jurist and pure patriot sustaining the legal * was set aside and derided as an old womans story the legislature of maryland in the exercise of its sovereign prerogative was * and the chief members of it conveyed to a northern bastile and the elections which subsequently came off were carried by driving from the polls at the point of the bayonet the legal voters and * in their stead the hireling soldiers who infested every portion of the state thus carrying out to the letter senator wilsons boast we have set the iron heel on maryland and will crush out her boundary lines the city of baltimore especially suffered in this onslaught against the laws of god and man her citizens were subject to the vilest indignities the most prominent of whom were sent to some one of the * of the tyrant to be held in many instances as hostages for the good behaviour of their friends in despite of all this with the city under the federal guns and the threat of being * to the ground * against her and troops stationed throughout every portion of her baltimore has vindicated her claim to be called the * and regardless alike of bribes or threats her people have remained true to their instincts of honour and fealty to the south and at peril of life and liberty and property have ever extended their bountiful hand to shelter and assist their brethren in their hour of need may heaven cast its protecting shield over the noble generous city of baltimore and may she ere long be welcomed as one of the proudest gems of the confederacy my own lot was now dismal enough i felt almost as one who had passed the confines of eternity and was looking on from another sphere upon the phantasmagoria in this i seemed to hold no visible connection with the world my friends and relatives were denied access to me unless they belonged to the black republican ranks and these were too prudent to risk their popularity by often availing themselves of the privilege and only then under the pressure of that public opinion which * to * their neighbours for acting precisely as they would have done under similar circumstances every means was employed which petty malice could devise to annoy me it had been argued at first that accustomed as i had been to a great deal of society and a very active life to * me in solitary imprisonment without air or exercise would soon reduce even my rebellious nature to submission but failing in this calculation they now sought eternally some invasion of the few privileges left for instance in going from my chamber to the library i would be often turned back until the officer in charge could go to the provost marshals and my poor little girl was circumscribed to a few feet in front of the house with an extra guard detached to watch her and although i paid for my own * it was often two or three weeks before i could send out my clothes i was also obliged to buy my own lights as the government refused to allow me any lieutenant sheldon had been ordered under arrest upon the charge of taking out communications for me but was released by order of seward my poor friend miss mackall with whom i kept up uninterrupted communication in spite of all the vigilance was untiring in her efforts to see me in turn she implored every member of the cabinet and finally went to lincoln whose reception of her was characteristic of the man he told her that she had had too much of my teachings already that i had done more to damage and bring his government into * than all the rest of the darned rebels together and by * she should never see me again if he could help it this was fatally prophetic i however sent him word that whilst he was engaged in the undignified task of * a prisoner and that prisoner a woman i was far more * occupied in making a new disguise for him to quit washington in the dear girl was however almost heartbroken for she loved me well and made a last appeal to provostmarshal andrew j porter who improving upon his masters brutality indulged in a * against me and concluded by rudely saying that he wondered why he had not already arrested her she left him in tears sobbed bitterly the way home retired to her bed from which she never after rose lily wrote me that same evening a full account of the above which reached me through my medium * she grew rapidly worse and in little more than a week from the above period she was dying throughout her illness she prayed to see me and a few hours before the fatal event was so earnest in her prayer saying that she could not die happily unless she was gratified that although late at night her mother sent to the provostmarshal his reply was that he had not the authority to grant the permission and that it rested with the secretary of state seward thereupon i wrote to seward asking the privilege of visiting my dying friend subject to any restriction he might impose his reply was forwarded to the provost marshal a copy of which was sent me and so my darling faithful friend was laid in her grave and the cold earth shut out her beautiful loving face for ever from my eyes i could not then weep but i prayed that the god of justice would in his hour of need deny the heartless * that mercy which he dressed in his brief authority had denied to me captain * congenial services in the police department were at last rewarded by promotion which transferred him to a new field of action and he was succeeded by captain mmillen whose gentlemanly conduct afforded a striking contrast on assuming his position he wrote me a most respectful and kind letter offering any service not inconsistent with his duty as an officer of the united states and although his acts were always guided by the most fastidious loyalty to his own government he was ever delicate and deferential in the performance of his disagreeable duty he was severely reprimanded on more than one occasion for being too lenient in other words too gentlemanly and finally my letters received or written which had been submitted to him for examination were transferred to the detective dennis who in order to seem vigilant in proportion to his former * returned me the simplest note as being offensive to the * of the provostmarshals office i was about this time the last of november quite ill from the close confinement and * of food dr mmillen a brother of captain mmillen was allowed to attend me and he ordered that more palatable and nutritious food should be supplied me which was done for a few days but on discovering that it was furnished at the cost of lieutenant sheldon i refused to receive it and got on as well as i could upon crackers and cheese which my faithful maid would contrive to procure for me i shall ever retain the most grateful recollection of dr * gentle humane kindness as well as that of his brother captain mmillen the conduct of these two formed a striking contrast to the * natures by whom i had been surrounded and who had control of my liberty and life dr mmillen was never but once after this allowed to visit me and then in the presence of an officer and his conversation strictly limited to his medical enquiry and prescription an * common to the abolition dynasty was that i exercised some spell over all who approached me whose natures were not * the * of simon cameron the secretary of war had now assumed such colossal dimensions and the onslaught against him by those who had not been so favoured by opportunity were so bitter that the government at washington were seriously embarrassed they had been of course aware of all this for months hence it was not * but the inconvenience of the discovery and consequent publicity which now disturbed mr lincoln and his ministry and a reasonable doubt may here be expressed as to whether the whole government were not committed to practices equally * mr seward had in the beginning upon the formation of the cabinet made the appointment of cameron a sine * non so he still sustained him with great warmth cameron although an uneducated man of * of intellect was gifted with wonderful * faculties but unlike most men who are endowed with this peculiar talent he dispensed his money with a princely hand for the attainment of his ends and there is no doubt but that the astute secretary of state mr seward had often experienced the benefit of the * talent of his friend one of the charges made and * against cameron was that he had drawn pay and rations and equipment for # men more than had ever been mustered into the service and that in every contract made by the war department whether for purchase of munitions of war or clothing for the soldiers his profits had been upon a like gigantic scale camerons friends had claimed for him in the original cast of the cabinet to be made secretary of the treasury as affording the * scope for the expansion of his genius but the northeastern wing of the abolitionists headed by sumner and wilson opposed this with great vehemence indulging in * not very flattering and brought forward chase in opposition when a very animated contest began between the partisans of each the conclusion of which it was difficult to foresee from an unexpected quarter of the house however a * arose to pour oil upon the troubled waters of * mr wigfall of texas a united states senator in his place said addressing himself to mr cameron who was also a senator hearken unto the counsels of thine enemy it is said that you are about to assume the portfolio of the treasury department it is a mistake with war comes the necessity for large supplies and big contracts i would advise you to take the war department as best suited to you and fortified his advice by * and apt quotations whether mr cameron was influenced by this * advice i know not but it is a remarkable coincidence that his claims to the first position were soon after withdrawn and he subsided quietly into the war department a congressional committee was appointed to investigate these and other * against the national treasury but long before they had fairly entered upon their labours cameron had been sent as minister plenipotentiary to the court of russia the government by this act showed as reckless a disregard for international courtesy as for its own national dignity and manifested more clearly than volumes could have done the character it was * to maintain amongst the nations of the earth for here was a man driven ignominiously from the councils of the nation by the force of public opinion for the meanest form of corruption sent as a representative of that nation at one of the * courts of europe the government itself entertained doubts of his reception and cameron did not set out on his mission until they had received satisfactory assurances on the subject fremont in his administration of the department of the west appears to have followed closely the precedent established by the * simon in the war department charges of an astounding nature were sent on to washington against him of * in office in short the old california charges of * * in the giving of contracts and general reckless extravagance he had also proved himself to be utterly * in a military point of view and this even his most zealous partisans were obliged to admit consequently his removal was loudly demanded no one who has followed the course of this adventurous aspirant for fame will be surprised at any phase of his destiny and as he has been brought forward conspicuously before the eyes of the world it may not be amiss to give a slight sketch of his origin and antecedents like many of the soldiers of fortune whose names have been emblazoned on the scroll of fame in the old world he is entitled to the bar sinister on his shield fremont pre was a french * and taught the graceful art in the city of richmond about the year 1812 or 1814 to most of the belles and beaux of that period the celebrated miss maria mayo afterwards mrs general scott was one of his pupils and my husband as a little boy had the benefit of his instruction this worthy son of la belle france was not content with the golden harvest he could legitimately reap in the exercise of his professional skill but essayed his talents in another field and soon made himself master of the situation and bore off in triumph a mrs pryor the wife of an old and respectable citizen of richmond who by the way took a most philosophical view of the domestic calamity and instead of pursuing with fire and sword the enterprising frenchman left him in peaceful possession of the * fair and took to himself a more congenial * the romantic pair had winged their flight to charleston in which city he resumed the practice of his profession and our hero john charles fremont was the fruit of this * conjunction some of the citizens of charleston took great interest in young fremont who was educated at their expense and afterwards sent to west point where he graduated without however giving any indications of extraordinary capabilities and was some years afterwards appointed as assistant to mr * in his scientific * and * and here even he was regarded more for his * industry than for genius he was a good * and after mr * death was employed to work out the result of his labours which he did with accuracy and skill fremont had meanwhile married the daughter of the honourable thomas hart benton who after a few years assumed his guardianship and launched him on his career by * influence he was sent to explore the route across the rocky mountains to california arriving there as the war with mexico broke out and there is no doubt that in the illegal and * measures of which he was guilty and the extraordinary assumption of power by him he but acted strictly under the instruction of benton who expected himself to be sent to mexico with * powers as he happily said in the senate with the sword in one hand and the purse in the other this scheme was exploded too soon for success and the bitter denunciation of it by all parties in the senate convinced the administration that it was useless to propose it for their ratification but the failure from whatever cause drew upon the administration of mr polk the antagonism of benton from that period the failure of * scheme operated very * upon fremont the commander of the department of california general * who was a most generous and * officer at first remonstrated with him upon the * of his proceedings but failing to produce any effect suspended and sent him to washington under arrest for trial where he arrived more with the air of a hero than one charged with high crime and * the court convened at washington for the trial of fremont was composed of officers of the highest grade general * being himself president of the court since the days of warren * perhaps no court had ever been invested with so much interest it was crowded each day by high officers of the government and other friends of the accused colonel benton was allowed extraordinary latitude in the defence and at times * or threatened the various members composing the court or the witnesses in short the whole power of the administration was employed to screen the criminal and even private courtesies to the members of the court by those connected with the government were discouraged i was severely remonstrated with by a high official upon the occasion of receiving general * and the other members of the court at dinner notwithstanding the extraneous pressure brought to bear upon it the court maintained a dignified impartiality in the exercise of its judicial functions giving the accused the benefit of all that could be adduced in his favour and not deterred by the array of power and influence from pronouncing judgment according to the proofs before them so after an arduous and exciting trial which lasted several weeks the court found fremont guilty upon every * and recommended that he should be severely reprimanded and struck from the rolls of the army the evidence which is on file in the war department at washington was so conclusive and the charges of so flagrant a character that the sentence was obliged to be confirmed mr polk subsequently however * him but fremont refused to accept the executive * knowing that he would be tabooed by the army shortly after he returned to california and on her admission as one of the states of the federal union he was selected by the governor as one of the persons to represent her in the united states senate he drew the short term consequently his legislative functions were only exercised for the space of three or four months and so little did he impress the people as to his capacity for the political arena that although he sought with great pertinacity the renewal of the honour he was never after able to achieve it fremont had managed during his first military sojourn in california to establish a claim to the celebrated marriposa grant and he now proposed to build an * house upon a portion of it and to settle himself there as a * it was at this time that i saw him in san francisco and spoke with him upon the subject he seemed really to long for the primitive life he had marked out and confessed himself utterly * for the part he had been appointed to play upon the worlds great stage in which opinion i heartily concurred he did not long however enjoy his * existence messrs palmer cook co being the evil spirits who tempted him from his retirement to the * of life again the abovementioned firm of palmer cook co were bankers of san francisco and the bon * proprietors of the marriposa owning threefourths of it whilst fremont represented onefourth subject to heavy * upon it for moneys advanced by them the marriposa was certainly a most royal * of incalculable mineral wealth but like the treasures described in aladdin locked in the bowels of the earth until the skill of the magician was employed to draw them forth it was too vast and costly an undertaking for individual enterprise and it was consequently resolved by the parties interested to enlist european capitalists in the plan for working the mines and otherwise developing its resources companies were formed in england to that end which were to be chartered and stocks issued c it was scarcely secondary in magnitude to the famous mississippi scheme fremont was supplied with ample funds and sent to europe as the agent of the * and in order to give clat to his mission these speculators resolved to * him as the republican candidate for the presidency having no end in view but the * of their * stock and ultimate pecuniary advantage not content with the political prestige they had given him those able * resolved to make him also appear as the richest man in the world circumstantial statements of his daily income of an incalculable amount were published simultaneously in new york paris and london rare gems of great size and value were said to be found in the mineral regions of the marriposa amongst them emeralds of such remarkable beauty as to throw into the shade the crown jewels of europe these were advertised as having been set for mrs fremont in short the monte * of dumas creation was not the possessor of such countless riches as was this agent of a wholesale * firm meanwhile the abolitionists resolved to accept the candidate which chance had furnished them to try the strength of their party of which they had no approximate idea charles francis adams now united states minister to england had been nominated with that object some years before at chicago but the result had demonstrated such a lamentable minority that no prominent man was willing to risk his prospects of future success by allowing his name to be used consequently the whole strength of the abolition party by way of experiment was concentrated upon fremont and although the constitutional party triumphed in the election of their candidate they were filled with dismay and grave misgivings for the future at the formidable front which the higher law party presented who in their turn were surprised at their own strength and from that hour the federal government was doomed and james buchanan destined to be the last president of the united states it was after this defeat of the abolitionists that the terrible poisoning scheme was attempted the marriposa humbug exploded and fremont was dropped by the party who had temporarily used him and suffered to relapse into poverty and obscurity until the revolution again brought him upon the surface the current of my story has been somewhat impeded by this long narrative * removal from the command of the department of the west had been determined on at washington mrs fremont came on herself to take counsel of f p blair and if possible delay the execution of the sentence but the exertions of that clever lady produced no visible effect in her husbands favour although they fired the zeal of her ancient servitor and friend who redoubled his exertions but also * blair laboured under the hallucination that his own * fame was indissolubly connected with that of thomas hart benton and that this was in some way mysteriously associated with the fulfillment of * prophecy as to * future greatness hence he laboured to bring about its accomplishment even though he encountered the antagonism of his own sons who violently opposed fremont regardless of the injunction that a house divided against itself must fall blair had also a private score to settle with the southern chivalry it had been by the influence of the southern members of the democratic party that he had been deprived of his position as government organ and consequent loss of the splendid * from the national crib so in order that he might wreak his vengeance upon that section he was willing to tear down the walls of the temple itself mrs fremont was treated with but scant ceremony by the authorities at washington after many days of delay she addressed a short but haughty note to president lincoln demanding an answer to her communication in order as she stated that she might return to her husband and children and the reply which this elicited from president lincoln was as curt as her own so she returned west from her * mission at washington and was received at st louis with regal honours a carriage and four awaited her in which she was escorted by a troop of cavalry with bands of music and bonfires to her husbands quarters so said the * * of the triumphal entry meanwhile the fiat had gone forth and halleck was appointed to the management of the department of the west which fremont had so lately mismanaged having however greatly the advantage over his predecessor in being of the genuine abolition party edwin m stanton had been appointed to succeed cameron in the war department the abolition congress was again in session and its work of * renewed general scott held on with a tenacity only equalled by that of daniel webster during president tylers administration but he was just now the fifth wheel to the abolition wagon and seriously * their movements and they resolved to adopt measures for the accomplishment of his removal which even they had shrunk from save in the last extremity so charges of treason were * up and articles of indictment actually prepared this last feather broke the camels back and he succumbed the first step accomplished it was determined to indulge the old mans avarice to the extent of their power the public mind was prepared for what was to follow by daily statements of his sinking health which alarmingly increased his resignation was prepared lincoln and his cabinet attended at his lodgings to hear it read which being received lincoln standing read to him the gracious act securing to him for life his pay and all the perquisites he had hitherto enjoyed after this general scott took a solemn leave of lincoln and * his patriotism as second only to washingtons that same afternoon he departed for new york and gave his parting benediction to the young general who with his staff in a pelting rain accompanied him to the train all dressed in black like the knight of the raven plume mr secretary seward and mr secretary chase with the mockery of honour accompanied him to new york telegrams from each * gave desponding accounts of the health of the illustrious exile from power and place at last he reached new york saw only mr john van buren and embarked after a few days for france arriving there in due course of time he seized upon the pretext of the mexican and french * and returned in the next steamer but one to new york where he lives in elegant state upon the price of his honor sic transit this account has been almost entirely taken from the government organ the public were for a little while amused with the rumour that the * hero was to be sent as special ambassador to mexico but that of course was only a * the espionage over me was now greater than at any previous period life was almost unendurable an undefined nameless terror was stealing over me of something more dark and terrible than i had yet been exposed to this feeling may be appreciated when it is remembered that i was a defenceless woman in the hands of a party which had shrunk from no crime to carry out its ends i was constantly assailed in its papers and some of my former friends and connections sought instead of protecting me to palliate and excuse the cowardly attacks my anxiety was not allayed by receiving a secret communication to be on my guard as an infernal plot was * against me at the same time enclosing extracts from abolition papers stating that i had lost my mind and that it was * that the government intended to remove me to a private lunatic asylum my blood * even now when i recall my feelings at the reception of this communication and i wonder that i had not gone mad my equanimity was by no means restored at this time by the announcement that the surgeongeneral of pennsylvania volunteers and several others desired to pay their respects to me i received him with smiles on my lips and fear and hate in my heart i do not remember the name as my journal was at a later period taken from me but he was very courteous and * for intruding upon me by saying that he had been most desirous of seeing a lady who had become so celebrated in the eyes of the world our conversation was spirited and upon the * topics of the times in which i bore my part as an uncompromising rebel and although the frightful idea was ever present that this man had been probably sent for the purpose of * me to a madhouse i jested lightly defiantly with him finally he said to me do you never find your mind giving way under this close solitary confinement i replied do you see any indications of * of mind he answered madam you fill me with admiration and astonishment not only by your cheerfulness but from the wonderful knowledge you have of what is going on i had never believed that any person could rise so superior to surrounding circumstances for i know he continued that the government has placed such an estimate upon your capacity as to resort to measures of unusual harshness in your imprisonment well i said doctor i defy their skill to thwart any purpose of mine and so far from * i never felt my mind clearer or more capable of mischief against your government than at this moment the visit after some further conversation terminated and i know not whether i was indebted to this gentleman but i heard no more of the madhouse scheme the officer of the guard lieutenant sheldon was not now allowed to hold personal communication with me the guard were set as spies upon each other and upon him they were ordered not to speak to me or answer questions under penalty of severe punishment one day a guard by name * gave me some ordinary information miss poole hearing him sent for the corporal of the guard and reported it the poor man was dealt with very harshly in consequence she also reported that my little child received some communication for me on the pavement which was untrue and the poor child was from that time doomed to as severe imprisonment as i now endured this was perhaps my hardest trial to see my little one pining and fading under my eyes for want of food and air without the power to avert the terrible doom which seemed impending the health and spirits of my faithful maid also began to fail and i felt often tempted to exclaim my god let this bitter cup pass from me the winter had set in with unusual severity and the heavens seemed in accord with the gloom of my own destiny by reason of the * of the weather i was now deprived of my only remaining pleasure that of receiving from afar the stealthy greeting of friends stealthy for the reason that if seen to wave a hand towards my prison arrest was sure to follow the reign of terror being now at its height no one unless under similar circumstances can realise the extent of this deprivation i remember some years ago when i was very young being invited to meet the celebrated italian exile * who had been a victim of austrian despotism and was for many years in solitary confinement as a state prisoner no knowledge from the outer world ever reached his dungeon empires had changed their destiny and kings had fallen the great napoleon had ended his mortal career at st helena charles x had been hurled from the throne of france and louis * reigned in his stead of this he knew nothing until he reached new york a prisoner no longer but exile from friends and fatherland i wept as i listened to his sad recital and thanked god that my destiny had been cast in a land where crimes like this could never be committed i did not then foresee that the scourge of black republican rule was to come upon us and sweep from the new world every vestige of civil rights and freedom as had been often done in the old mclellan from having been lulled into a false security by the * lavished upon him to that end began now to realise all the difficulties of his position the * cry of on to richmond was again raised and his judgment sought to be overruled as to the means by which that feat was to be accomplished mclellan had laboured hard to make his army the best appointed and best disciplined in the world and considering the heterogeneous materials he had to work upon he certainly had effected marvels the programme which he had marked out for himself was fully in accordance with the wisdom and foresight he had displayed in other respects he understood thoroughly the morale of his army and that his only hope of success in invading the south was by overwhelming numbers but seward and the other * of * did not intend that mclellan should reap the substantial fruits which the success of his plans would have placed within his grasp the object for which he had been inflated to his present eminence had been fully accomplished general scott had as completely passed away from the public mind as if his funeral dirge had been already sung so these carpet warriors who had already slain their thousands by the stroke of their pens addressed themselves seriously to the work of * mclellan and would had they dared have removed him from his illstarred eminence mclellan had however succeeded in gaining the confidence as i have said before of a large party it is true that he had done nothing so far to establish a claim to high consideration having as yet performed no deeds of * to entitle him to his laurel wreath although his achievements in western virginia in the early part of the campaign had been absurdly exaggerated as an excuse for his undue elevation the popular voice nevertheless was in his favour and cried loudly that he should be retained to carry out his programme his soldiers were attached to him and any attempt to suspend him would have been attended with hazardous results until that army had been again demoralised by the hardships and exposure of another unsuccessful campaign had mclellan possessed the moral courage at this time to have boldly stated his ultimatum and given in his resignation in case it was not complied with he would have triumphed temporarily over his adversaries who were not prepared to push things to this extremity they still believed washington to be threatened by beauregard and amidst the * and revelry of the capitol they were tremblingly alive to the * rumour of an advance the fortifications were being hourly strengthened and extended and large quantities of provisions and other stores were distributed in the basement of the capitol and public buildings and throughout other portions of the city in preparation for a siege the public archives had been removed to philadelphia in the beginning of august a short time after the battle of manassas when the panic was at its height thereby creating great fright in the city of brotherly love as the sealed yellow cases in which those important state papers were conveyed were supposed to be the yankee dead from the disastrous plains of manassas so not only were the imaginations of the * disturbed by the fear of the grim ghosts of the * dead but pestilence also and in order to allay the excitement consequent thereupon it became necessary to make an official announcement of the character of the freight contained in the yellow cases unimportant as this incident may seem it is still a part of the record of the days of panic as if for the purpose of annoying me at this time the few short and unsatisfactory letters which i sent i through the provostmarshals office were upon one pretext or another objected to upon one occasion i wrote to a friend to tell cousin lucy that i had firm reliance upon divine providence that was returned to me with a note stating that all names must be written in full and no ambiguous expressions used i thereupon by way of protest wrote to suggest that the provostmarshal should issue a printed circular * the formula to be used prisoners as i was gifted with no faculty to divine what he might consider ambiguous that the only expression which could possibly be incomprehensible to him was that wherein i had expressed my reliance on divine providence and that he recalled to my mind a circumstance which had occurred in a much more civilised land than this the british parliament having some years ago instituted a commission to enquire into the moral condition of the * a learned divine who formed part of that commission reported on his return in evidence of their state of moral ignorance that on going to one of the largest * he asked does anyone know jesus christ here that the question * through the pit and the answer came thundering back no we do nt know him he do nt work here a similar response would probably be elicited from the provostmarshals office as to a question of divine providence an order was also issued from the state department prohibiting me the purchase of the newspapers or my being informed of their contents this was in consequence of the publication of my letter to mr seward the utmost consternation prevailed as to the means by which it had reached richmond as it was not intended that the secrets of the * should be * to the world the new york herald published my letter with the following editorial * mrs * indignant letter to mr seward we are indebted to the richmond whig for the pungent letter which we publish today of mrs rose greenhow to mr seward touching her late imprisonment in her own house in washington as a secession emissary having been released and sent over into secessia she doubtless furnished a copy of the letter in question to the journal from which it is extracted it is just such a * as one would expect under the circumstances from a spirited dashing active and fearless female politician of the south carolina school of secession * she complains bitterly of the rude and offensive behaviour of her gaolers but she forgets that men thus employed i are very seldom remarkable for the * and accomplishments graces and gallantry of the fashionable circles of washington she * fluently but * upon the freedom of speech and upon her right to exercise it and upon the cruel tyranny of her imprisonment but she forgets that while at large in washington she was a dangerous agent of a hostile army * our national capital grant all the personal rights of freedom of speech and action which mrs greenhow demands in the midst of this great rebellion and we may as well abolish our armies and turn over the country to * * for under this system of liberty we should all be at the mercy of ruffians and robbers in those gay secession circles which ruled the court and cabinet at our federal city under the * * administration of mr buchanan mrs greenhow was a bright and shining light she had no doubt shared with that brilliant and charming coterie of which mrs slidell and mrs gwin were the ruling spirits that splendid secession idea of the easy occupation of washington by jeff davis his camp cabinet congress and government and that under this new rgime the fascinating coterie aforesaid including mrs greenhow would be exalted to a higher and an indefinite reign of beauty and glory mr seward however interposed like an evil magician and with a wave of his powerful wand destroyed all these beautiful castles in the cloud and so we can excuse this piquant and pungent letter of mrs greenhow even the great napoleon philosopher as he was when cooped up at st helena could not refrain from scolding on the 20th december the judgeadvocate colonel key came to call upon me i had seen him several times before there was a certain * about this officer very offensive to me he was or affected to be very deaf as an excuse for approaching very near in conversation the second time i saw him he attempted to take my hand as he said to find out whether i had ever done any work i withdrew it saying that my head had laboured more than my hands upon this occasion however his manner was respectful and earnest he expressed anxiety to serve me said that he had thought my imprisonment impolitic that he was opposed to the policy of * women and that although he came now without being officially empowered to speak with me on the subject of my release he was free to tell me that he had held conversations with some of the heads of the government on the subject and that they were greatly embarrassed to know what to do with me i answered oh yes they dare not hang me are afraid to release me and would like to encourage me to escape in order that they might catch me and spirit me away having in mind the effort made a short time previous to induce me to attempt to escape he smilingly continued the government have come to the conclusion that it is of no use to attempt to make terms with you that between you and them it is do your worst to the end of the war and the only way left is to treat you as the british government did smith * banish you he then said quickly what terms would you be willing to * my heart beat wildly for even that chance gleam of freedom agitated me i however crushed down the impulse for i saw that he was watching me very narrowly and answered none sir i demand my unconditional release * for my losses and restoration of my papers and effects he said these last i cannot undertake for i know that your papers will not be given up and all the effects of rebels will be confiscated i may not he continued be able to accomplish anything in regard to your personal freedom as there is a very strong influence against you but i * you had better let me make the best terms i can i replied freedom is sweet and although i have suffered much there are many things dearer to me and i will not compromise a principle even though i am detained as a prisoner for the war the sentence i learn already pronounced against me he inclined his head and then spoke of still greater hardships to which i might be exposed and professed himself greatly interested in my situation i told him that i would require time to think over all he had said and that i was at the present wholly unprepared to terminate a conference upon the subject and that i would desire him to call again he requested me to write to him through the provostmarshals office as he could not venture to call otherwise as it would subject him to the suspicion of southern sympathies this will serve as another illustration of that iron despotism which forbade even the exercise of ordinary humanity this man was a native of maryland and paid the penalty of treason to his state by the suspicious vigilance of his new masters on * mrs douglas sent through the provostmarshals office a large cake and other little tokens to my little girl which made her very happy and bright lieutenant sheldon also by a stretch of authority allowed her to go out and join in the festivities of the day at the houses of several of her young friends other tokens of respect and affection reached me through less orthodox channels and so if the day was not a happy one it was at least marked by no disagreeable incident as if to contrast it with the dark ones immediately to follow on the 26th i received a note by my little bird warning me that an attempt would be made to remove me to a northern prison that a telegram had been sent to fort warren to hold in readiness a room for me there at the same time i was assured that i should be rescued in case this was done that my friends only awaited my orders that my prison was watched by them day and night and signals agreed upon c my house which had been transformed into a government prison now became a sort of mecca strangers visiting washington thronged to see the residence of so noted a rebel and the newspapers * to the greedy curiosity to know something of my habits and tastes the apartments of the unfortunate marie antoinette were not more thoroughly * or her occupations for the weary hours given with more minute details than were mine the house was called fort greenhow photographs of it appeared in several of their illustrated papers and their mimic punch vanity fair devoted a number to me wherein with very heavy wit it proved that i a simple woman had * seward and * the whole yankee nation coarse abuse was * levelled against me which they took care should reach my ear these cowardly * passed harmlessly by as i had a proud consciousness of superiority and regarded them as testimonials in favour of my devotion to the cause of my countrys freedom other prisoners were from time to time brought in and generally of the lowest class with the exception of mrs eleanor lowe an english lady whose son was in the confederate service and the posey family of maryland who were most estimable people these were however only detained for a few days upon suspicion of giving signals to the confederate army across the potomac on the 30th of december a woman named baxley was confined as a prisoner she was arrested on the truce boat by reason of her garrulous boasting of having gone to richmond to obtain a commission for her lover one dr * brown of having nuts from president daviss table and of instructions to open communication with my prison being also as she said the bearer of a letter to me all this i need scarcely say was the result of a disordered imagination although it afforded a pretext for what was to follow the conduct of this woman on arriving at the prison confirmed the impression entertained at the time of her arrest of her being non * * she raved from early morn till late at night in language more vehement than delicate i was an involuntary listener to her cries and imprecations and pity and disgust were often strangely commingled my chief care was to prevent my child from hearing much that was unfit for her ear but i felt the horrors of my position hourly increasing occasional excitement was now produced in the prison by the real or affected * of miss poole and this mrs baxley the premonitory symptoms being a loud cry and heavy fall upon the floor of one or other followed by the call of the sentinel on duty of corporal of the guard no 3 this individual usually rushed to the rescue accompanied by two or three of the stoutest sentinels bayonet in hand the officer of the guard bringing up the rear with the judicial gravity of * * conspicuously flourishing a brandy bottle that being the masculine * for all the ills of life on the 29th i wrote again to the honourable wm h seward thinking that he had had time sufficient to * the contents of my first letter which in consequence of its publication in the new york herald and other papers formed the subject of conversation in all circles in washington friend and foe united in * to it a degree of literary merit to which it had no claim i was amused at the various criticisms passed upon it by the refined ladies of president lincolns court they were horrified that i should have spoken so plainly of the * to which i had been exposed although their sensibilities were not shocked at the fact that in a christian age a lady should have suffered these outrages only that she should proclaim them this is but a fair sample of the morality of the new rgime on the morning of the 5th of january as i attempted to pass from my chamber to my library i was startled but not surprised at finding a double guard stationed at my door with instructions not to allow me to quit my chamber until lieutenant sheldon had returned from the provostmarshals since the evening of the 26th i had seen indications of some new tactics the detective police had been in constant attendance for four or five days consequently i was prepared for any extraordinary display of their * genius miss poole had been allowed unlimited range of the house at all hours of the day or night this concession was purchased by surveillance over me my child had been closely confined upon her representations as was also my maid and the attempt of several of the guard to communicate information to me had been likewise reported all knowledge of the outer world which now reached me was in writing her room adjoining mine made it impossible for me to speak to anyone the newspapers reached me sometimes in spite of the rigid prohibition i however was obliged to destroy them as soon as read for fear of their discovery bringing harm to those who furnished them the government organ which i received at this time contained an article headed daring attempt to rescue the dangerous rebel mrs greenhow it went on to say that on the 27th a cake had been brought to my house by a suspected party that on examining it a large number of treasury notes were found concealed in it together with a note describing a plot for my escape and conveyance into virginia the money sent being to bribe the guards that so dangerous a person as i was should be conveyed to a place of greater security and that the government had determined to remove me to some one of the northern * out of reach of my * friends this was so absurd that in spite of the danger it foreshadowed i could not help being amused by it i could now understand why double guards had been stationed all around the house an additional force having been detailed for the purpose and for several nights they had been under arms with double cartridges served out to them it was of course all for the purpose of giving * to the cake story and justification for the acts of * in contemplation i had defied and exposed their infamous secret police system every member of which hated me and they now resorted to this clumsy device as a means of gratifying their malignant spite as well as to inspire me with a wholesome dread for the future it is difficult to estimate properly the extent of the power and influence wielded by this corrupt organisation it had so acted upon the nervous fears of lincoln seward mclellan co by the discovery of murderous plots which existed by virtue of their * genius only as to acquire complete * over them a detective guard was appointed for the protection of each the chief of police took precedence of everyone in obtaining audience and had access to the representatives of the government at any hour of the day or night and there was no officer of the government too high to dread their influence general stone of the old united states army owed his arrest and disgrace to these creatures in fact they now were the power behind the throne and their very names inspired terror and were whispered with livid lips by the trembling victims within reach of their power the sound of my own voice now appeared strange to me and i often read aloud that i might not lose the power of * its tones i felt that a crisis in my destiny was rapidly approaching on the evening of the 4th an order was given that the prisoners should not leave their quarters after six oclock this had clearly no reference to me as i never went beyond my own apartments but it confined miss poole to hers whereupon she had one of those remarkable fainting fits which i have described before the officer of the guard now returned from the provostmarshals and the corporal came to announce to me that the prohibition had been removed and i was at liberty to go to my library i breakfasted with my child and seated myself at my usual occupation for this hour that of giving her lessons by this time i learned that a guard had been stationed inside of miss * room i was very much shocked for i could not imagine what the unfortunate woman had been doing to have brought this severity upon herself i attempted to enter my chamber and was told that i could not go into it hearing the sound of mens voices within i readily comprehended that mr sewards secret police were at work in order to obtain the copy of the second letter i had written to him a few days before but as in the first instance my copy had gone out simultaneously with the original which was held back until that object had been accomplished i returned to the library and destroyed all the papers which i feared to fall into their hands in about two hours the officer of the guard came to the library looking as pale as marble followed by the corporal and two of the guard all armed the officer having on his belt and sword and the others with musket and bayonet looming in the distance were the shadows of those evil spirits the detective allen or * with several of his * the officer of the guard touched his hat and said mrs greenhow will you please walk downstairs i arose and after glancing around without speaking obeyed i believed that the detectives thought that i would resist and therefore came prepared with brute force to execute their will and i was resolved to give them no advantage over me by losing my temper but none can tell the effort it cost me to control myself the most brutal of the guard had been selected for this mornings work i was detained about an hour out of my apartments when i was notified that i could return to them i was fully prepared for what was to follow the north window of the library had been sealed and nailed up and my journal and every scrap of paper had been taken from my writingdesk and table and upon examining my wardrobe i found that several valuable articles of clothing had been abstracted whether this had been done by the detectives or the guard i am not prepared to say on the morning of the 6th i sent to the officer of the guard to demand pen ink and paper also that i might be allowed to purchase the newspaper he returned for answer that general porter had ordered that i should not be allowed to have either i sent a second time to say that i wished to write to the judgeadvocate colonel key thereupon he sent me a single sheet of paper and pen and ink i wrote that same day to colonel key stating that i was now prepared to hear what he had to say to me further upon the subject of my release with a courtesy very remarkable for an employ of the abolition government he came immediately on the receipt of my note but appeared embarrassed and ill at ease he told me that circumstances had occurred since i last saw him which made him fear that he had lost all power to serve me he asked me what proposition i had to make i replied that in my last interview i had defined my position and stated my ultimatum he said it had been spoken of to send me north but that it had been objected to on the ground that i might institute legal proceedings against the government which would give them some trouble i replied which i should most unquestionably do he said unfortunately the publication of my letter to seward and another couched in terms of still greater bitterness had aroused great indignation against me and he questioned whether the subject of my release would be now entertained i replied that i did not question his sincerity as he had given me a strong reason in the fact that he was going with mclellan into virginia in support of it but i very much doubted whether the parties who had authorised him to speak on the subject with me had been honest originally in their intentions but had rather designed through that means to obtain some indications from me i then related the late * visit to which i had been subjected upon this he made no comment but alluded * to the power arrayed against me and left me saying that he would return in a short time after consultation with parties whom he would not name he did return in about two hours and gave me the very * information that on account of the dangerous extent of the knowledge i possessed it was deemed inexpedient to release me he refused to tell me whose influence had been exerted against me but i already knew that it was seward and mclellan instigated by the detective allen from the rough notes in my possession i am enabled to supply a copy of my letter to seward of december 27th by a fatality which it would not be safe to explain the copy which i sent out never reached the hands for which it was designed this letter was written prior to the surrender of our commissioners mason and slidell and i cannot be supposed to have been very solicitous that mr seward should uphold the dignity of yankeedom neither did i expect that he would for i knew that his cowardice would shrink from assuming the responsibility of the acts of his agent * at the same time that his * and cunning would afford a plausible mask for the real feelings which guided his decision contempt and defiance alone actuated me i had known seward intimately and he had frequently enjoyed the hospitalities of my table and at a time when few had the moral courage to countenance him upon his return from europe shortly after the miserable fanatic john brown had paid the penalty of his crime mr seward was dining at my house with a large party amongst whom were mr and mrs charles francis adams an unfortunate allusion was made to some circumstances connected with the affair at harpers ferry when mrs adams launched out into a panegyric on john brown calling him that holy saint and martyr turning her glance full upon me at the time to which i replied in a clear and audible voice for it may be supposed that this conversation silenced all other i have no sympathy for john brown he was a traitor and met a traitors doom and turning to seward i remarked i think you evinced very good taste in * all connection with john brown in your speech a few days since in the senate in reply he said i remember to have met him once and but once only he called on me about some matter of business the nature of which i dont now recollect he struck me as a wild and visionary man erratic in his ways and singularly striking in his appearance but at the same time in our brief interview he impressed me with the conviction that he was a bold truthful and honest man but eccentric to a degree bordering on an unsettled state of mind i was at this time busy with my preparations for going to europe and necessarily crowded with affairs and the interview entirely passed from my mind until this unfortunate occurrence in which i have been sought to be implicated and which clearly proves the correctness of my original suspicion as to the unsettled state of his mind colonel george magruder remarked that his conduct at harpers ferry had not sustained mr sewards impression of his character as it proved that he was not free from fear from the vice of lying and of robbery and of theft seward replied in an indifferent tone i knew nothing about him only saw him once for a few moments and the impression was very much weakened by the new scenes through which i have since passed the conversation at this point diverged and seward aided me with great skill in directing it into a new channel mr adams who was sitting on the other side of me remained perfectly silent i should have shrunk from the most distant allusion to these incidents had they not become matters of public notoriety president buchanan spoke to me on the subject to which i replied do you keep spies in my household i was very much vexed for i had hoped that the social gatherings of so humble an individual as myself would have escaped observation he said how you talk i have heard it spoken of by five or six persons who all greatly commended your spirit and independence and you have my most hearty approval honourable henry d wilson of massachusetts told me also that the black republicans blamed mrs adams very much and thought the demonstration on her part very * a few days after i encountered mr seward and he approached me saying i have just been writing to our friend lady n and have told her that in all washington you were the only person who had the independence to give a mixed dinner party alluding to the strong social lines of division which were then drawn between the southern and northern parties i replied and you may also add that i am so well satisfied with the result of that experiment that i shall not try it again perhaps had he * my real object he would not have been so grateful to me for the social countenance at this early day i saw foreshadowed what was to follow and i desired to obtain a thorough insight into the plans and schemes of those who were destined to become the prominent actors in the fearful drama in order that i might turn it to the advantage of my country when the hour for action arrived to this end i employed every capacity with which god has endowed me and the result was far more successful than my hopes could have flattered me to expect i had verbatim reports of every caucus of every cabinet council beginning with the hasty conclave convened on the morning of lincolns unexpected arrival in * at willards hotel with piquant additions of private anecdotes of the distinguished pair in which mrs lincoln was described as * the ears of a * chambermaid who inclined too amiably to receive the salute of her illustrious spouse seward at this time verily believed in the fulfilment of his own predictions that all things would be restored to quiet in thirty days like the ostrich which * its head in the sand at the approach of danger he had wrapped himself in his * pride which aided by his increased * habits made him see all things through the mirage of his own mind his coadjutors entertained the same belief although based upon different grounds with the vast power of the federal government in their hands and with no constitutional scruples as to its use they believed that they had the means to corrupt so large a proportion of the prominent men of the south that it only required them to use this moral * at will to bring about the desired result they had already employed it with such success as to make them confident of the future scott had been won to their support through this * influence crittenden and holt had been successfully * with each bribed by the same bait a seat on the supreme bench which was never designed to be given to either charles sumner actually recorded his vote in caucus in favour of crittenden crittenden told me that he expected to receive the appointment i asked a member of that caucus wilson will they give it to him i rather think not was the reply but we will hold out the bait to them until they cant retreat the recreant renegade stanley of north carolina who had some years before been defeated as the abolition candidate for governor of california was bought to betray his native state by being made provisional governor thereof other conspicuous instances i might cite but this record belongs to the historian whose duty it is to brand those traitors for all time with the mark of cain rather than to this simple record of my own sufferings and personal experience stanton was now in the full exercise of his * as secretary of war he had been introduced into the abolition cabinet solely to bring about the * of mclellan whose elevation in the first instance had been for a similar end it was supposed that stanton in his character of quasi democrat based upon the fact that as a dernier ressort he had been selected in the last days of mr buchanans * to fill a vacancy would draw around him the conservative party which had hitherto constituted mclellans strength these political * were not aware of the facts that stanton had never enjoyed the confidence of any party that he was viewed as an astute cunning lawyer rather than a profound one and that he had only received the appointment in mr buchanans cabinet after repeated failures to induce southern men to take the position and his appointment was regarded as an evidence of the weakness and * of the administration and entire loss of the confidence of the southern party i must take occasion here to * all intention of casting an imputation upon mr buchanan personally for whose ability and high moral worth i have the most profound appreciation he was full of honours as of years and unfit to grapple with the terrible events which crowded upon the closing period of his administration he had grown old in the service of his country and cherished a holy reverence for its institutions and would i believe have sacrificed his own life to have averted the doom of disruption and sought at least by a negative policy to stay its progress by a fatality of birth he was thrown on the wrong side when the sectional division came but he nevertheless carries with him to the retirement of * where i have spent many happy days the affectionate remembrances of many of his old friends stanton however had full confidence in his own ability to bring about these desirable results and in his turn received the * of the * hireling northern press which now invariably concluded its * by * him the great secretary * him for the time with all the attributes of queen * celebrated prime minister * who had for nearly three centuries enjoyed the title of the great secretary until mr attorney stanton came to dispute it with him bennett of the new york herald being more honest or more astute than his contemporaries was more stinted in his praise and

private life and ordering him very significantly to * his preparations for the on to richmond it might have been supposed that mclellan young ambitious and with an army to back his pretensions would if he had not absolutely rebelled against this summary * have at least shown himself restive in submitting to the fiat of the pennsylvania lawyer whose skill had hitherto been displayed in the ingenious use of legal technicalities of doubtful equity and in making the worse appear the better cause according to the size of the retaining fee but in * our young napoleon showed himself imbued with a most christian spirit for when smitten on one cheek he meekly turned the other thereby * the expectation of friend and foe and set himself to the performance of the duty assigned him hoping like mr * that something would turn up to stanton belongs the credit of having perfected that * system of official reports which emanated from the republican war office it had originated under his predecessor cameron who was however not scholar enough always to observe geographical probabilities or * accuracy in the exercise of his * genius those which mr stanton promulgated were liable to no fastidious criticism of that sort for though equally efforts of imagination they were nevertheless * as to literary merit as well as from the effect they produced upon the sympathetic pulse of the new

despot soft and deferential in his manners to the point of * when it suited him he was insolent and arrogant to those whom the chapter of accidents placed in his power though even this was tempered by a certain degree of prudence for like seward he was physically a coward he affected great brevity of style and an inquisitorial severity of manner more suited to a criminal lawyer before the old bailey than a cabinet minister of the nineteenth century the public were often treated to descriptions of those audiences and of the trembling victims who stood awestruck before the haughty minister i have alluded to the * means at this time resorted to for filling the depleted abolition coffers it would be an erroneous idea to suppose for a moment that those able * the moneyed men of new england looked upon their transactions with mr secretary chase from any other than a business point of view in which each party was to drive the most lucrative bargain possible they at least did not attempt to assume the flimsy threadbare guise of patriotism that was reserved for the people who were to be * and led to the slaughter in order that there might be a united northern party the old facilities

described her appearance upon some occasion with this queenly fabric around her i saw mrs lincoln once only and paid a * for the gratification of my curiosity i was returning from the marketplace where i had gone to purchase some flowers and shrubs one hot summer morning at an early hour and in passing a small shop in the avenue saw standing before it the imperial coach with its purple hangings and tall footmen in white gloves so yielding to the instinct of mother eve i went into the shop and there beheld a little woman * for some black cotton lace very much seemingly to the disgust of the * who left her when i entered and came to me i * who is that for naturally i was curious to know which member of the family royal stood before me only madam * i asked for some trifle deposited my * and feeling now that i had a legitimate right to look made the most of the opportunity she is a short broad fiat figure with a broad flat face with sallow * complexion light grey eyes with scant light eyelashes and exceedingly thin pinched lips * and a slightly scornful expression * her bearing as if to rebuke one for passing between the wind and her nobility mrs lincoln however must be very tenderhearted as she has been frequently known to express great compassion for the poor slaves whom god had made free and the wicked southerners had made this war to keep them in bondage her dress however was very grand yet i dont think that * or mrs davis would have selected it for that hour and occasion the gown was composed of a rich silk of light ground with gaudy flowers embroidered over it lying in voluminous folds full half a yard on the ground point * collar and sleeves elaborately made up with pink * white hat adorned with feathers and flowers interspersed with * balls white parasol lined with pink white gloves and a superb mantle of black lace completed her costume these items were all very deliberately noted and although not a very artistic description it is nevertheless a precise inventory of mrs lincolns shopping toilet on saturday january 18 at two oclock i learned incidentally that i was to be removed from my own house to another prison i was sitting in the library reading with my little one at my feet playing with her dolls prattling and * me almost into forgetfulness of the wickedness and persecutions which beset me until recalled by this startling intelligence i immediately sent for the officer of the guard and demanded to know the facts he told me that he had orders not to communicate with me on the subject or to speak with me at all but would go to the provostmarshal general porter and obtain further instructions he returned after a short time with written orders from that functionary fixing the hour for my removal detective allen had the ordering and regulation of the necessary arrangements the few articles of clothing for myself and child which i was allowed to take were gathered together and packed with a sentinel standing over and examining each piece separately less than two hours was allowed me before i was dragged from my home for ever a covered wagon surrounded by a file of soldiers was ordered by allen to be my conveyance to my new prison believing that i should feel humiliated by this indignity lieutenant sheldon however positively refused to obey this order detective allen was a german jew and possessed all the national instincts of his race in an exaggerated degree besides having these inherent characteristics sharpened by yankee association miss poole at this time took the oath of allegiance and fifty dollars in gold from the yankee government and went on her way rejoicing the woman baxley also applied to be released upon similar terms which was refused and she was sent to the old capitol prison upon which occasion i saw her for the first time at about four oclock i turned my back upon what had once been a happy home and what was to me an additional grief parted from my faithful maid who had thus far stayed with me through all my trials and served me with a fidelity and devotion not often equalled in the higher walks of life my child wept bitterly on parting from her and i confess that the pathetic appeals of the faithful creature to be allowed to follow my gloomy fortunes quit unnerved me the majority of the guard were drawn up in front of the house to witness my departure several them had been very kind and on taking leave i said i trust that your next duty will be a more honourable one than that of guarding helpless women and children i cast my eye up and saw that the windows were all crowded with men amongst whom i recognised several correspondents of the new york and philadelphia press eagerly watching my words and looks i reached the old capitol prison just at dark but whether in anticipation of some demonstration on the part of my friends i know not but the whole guard were under arms to receive me a general commotion was visible in all directions and it was evident that a great deal of interest and curiosity was felt as to the destination of so noted a rebel the * or office was crowded with officers and others all peering at me it was with a strange feeling of indifference that i found myself in this prison i had already gone through so many trials that this crowning act of * could only * a smile of scorn i now parted from lieutenant sheldon who had entitled himself to my most grateful remembrance his kindness to me had exposed him to the suspicion of his own government and it was through his * that i was now enabled to rescue some few cherished memorials from the general wreck of my effects so soon as i left the house the members of the press in waiting took advantage of the opportunity to examine my apartments and for days after the principal abolition journals throughout the whole country contained descriptions speculations c as a sample of the * manner in which i was paraded before the public i have thought fit to give a few extracts from some of them this brought no response but i was subsequently informed that lieutenant carlton was temporarily placed under arrest although he was in the order of * again in command at the prison i can give no idea of the petty annoyances to which i was constantly exposed i was never allowed to cross my chamber door if a servant now entered to perform the smallest duty the door was immediately locked and bolted so that it was necessary to rap or call some five or ten minutes before they could get out and when it is remembered that these servants were often negro men who claimed perfect equality and would * tell me that massa lincoln had made them as good as me that they would not be called negroes but * of colour some idea may be felt of the vague undefined feeling of uneasiness that was constantly upon me it is but justice to the superintendent of the prison mr wood to state that whenever the insolence of the negroes came to his knowledge that he invariably sent them away and that so far as he was able to do so he protected the prisoners from the insolence and outrage of the guard and officers the rules with regard to my child were * rigid the act of * ran thus miss rose greenhow although not a prisoner is subject to the same rules and regulations prescribed for a prisoner she was in fact as much a prisoner as i was i had never been consulted on the subject and when occasionally from very shame she was allowed to go down in the yard the child often came up crying from the effects of the brutality and * to which she was exposed the superintendent was as i have above said disposed to be kind but there was a constant struggle going on between him and the military authorities for supremacy by which the comfort of the prisoner was sacrificed and his liberty * it would seem to have been purposely arranged that these respective * should result in * vigilance over the helpless victims i can conceive no more horrible destiny than that which was now my lot at nine oclock the lights were put out the roll was called every night and morning and a man peered in to see that a prisoner had not escaped through the keyhole the walls of my room swarmed with vermin and i was obliged to employ a portion of the precious hours of candlelight in burning them on the wall in order that myself and child should not be devoured by them in the course of the night the bed was so hard the i was obliged to fold up my clothing and place them under my child in spite of this she would often cry out in the night oh mamma the bed hurts me so much the portion of the prison in which i was confined was now almost entirely converted into negro quarters hundreds of whom were daily brought in the rooms above and below mine being appropriated to their use and the tramping and screaming of negro children overhead was most dreadful the * which circumscribed my view * with them shocking both sight and smell for the air was rank and pestiferous with the * from their bodies and the language which fell upon the ear and sights which met the eye were too revolting to be depicted for it must be remembered that these creatures were of both sexes huddled together indiscriminately as close as they could be packed emancipated from all control and suddenly endowed with constitutional rights they considered the exercise of their unbridled will as the only means of * their equality in addition to all other sufferings was the terrible dread of * diseases several cases of smallpox occurring and my child had already taken the * which had broken out amongst them my clothes when brought out from the wash were often filled with vermin constantly articles were stolen complaint on this head of course was unheeded our free fellowcitizens of colour felt themselves entitled to whatever they liked several times during this period my child was reduced to a bare change of garments and the supreme contempt with which they regarded a rebel was of course very edifying to the yankees who rubbed their hands in glee at the signs of the irrepressible conflict one day i called for a servant from the window a negro man basking in the sun below called out is any of you ladies named laura * woman up dare wants you and by way of still further increasing the satisfaction with this condition of things captain gilbert of the #* pennsylvania volunteers drilled these negroes just below my window i protested against these * and threatened to make an appeal to the united states senate to send a committee to enquire into our present hapless condition as they had done in the case of the negro thieves and felons confined in the gaol many of whom had been released by habeas corpus and whose cases had been deemed worthy of a senatorial report this threat procured the instant removal of the negroes to more comfortable quarters the congressional committee of investigation instituted on account of mr secretary camerons eccentric financial * was still labouring amidst the turbid pools of corruption whose depth they were trying to fathom its researches had taken a far more extended range than was originally intended the newspapers in conjunction with dame rumour sometimes lifted the screen and gave the public a peep at the nature of the examinations with which the committee had charged themselves and they were certainly of a very extraordinary character the most remarkable being the charges against mrs lincoln of corruption c mrs lincoln was said to have purchased from a new york hardware establishment a dinner service of china for the white house to be paid for by the government for which the dealer presented a bill to mr lincoln for the sum of # dollars that he refused to pay the * price and sent for a hardware dealer of washington to consult as to the real value who estimated it at about 800 dollars that the new york dealer still insisted on his original demand telling mr lincoln significantly that he had better pay it without further question that lincoln insisting to know what he meant the dealer finally gave the history of the transaction as follows that the real price of the china had been 800 dollars but mrs lincoln had directed him to make out the bill for # and hand over the surplus to her the nature of some of these charges can be better understood by the formal defence which the new york herald thought fit to make of her character and domestic virtues it * the attempt of the committee to interfere with the harmonious domestic relations of president lincoln and his wife said that she should be like caesars wife above suspicion c this was very noble and praiseworthy on the part of the herald but the committee were dealing with things as they were and not as they ought to be although they afterwards came to the conclusion that it was incompatible with the good of public morals that their researches should be published it will however at some future day form a curious * to the history of the times in the hands of some chronicler of the rise and fall of the model republic which has been more recently characterised as the best government the sun ever shone upon the movements of mclellan were now hurried and he was forced to assume the defensive in the manner and place indicated by others the second advance on manassas was in accordance with this plan and the result proved even more disastrous to the abolition army than the first they could no longer * themselves as to the superiority of the fighting qualities of the enemy they had to contend with it had been demonstrated at manassas and equally fatally at balls bluff where the fanatical * baker met his just doom and they were now to learn that this hated southern chivalry whom they reported at manassas to have laid down behind their trenches too enervated to load their own guns which was done by their negroes for them exceeded them quite as much in hardy endurance as in strategy and skill all qualities essential to success and in this instance as if to show their contempt for the foe who had required almost eight months to recover from the last shock of arms added insult to injury by holding them in check with wooden guns actually introducing with success the chinese system of warfare against these puritan * of the nineteenth century it was at this time that i replied to the boast made by some yankee officers of the total annihilation of our army we will not fight you at manassas but will lead you on to the chickahominy where we will welcome you to hospitable graves after the actual occurrence this chance prophecy was published in the new york herald and other papers as an evidence of my uninterrupted communication with the army at manassas and the prince de * in his * letter for mclellans defeat says he was forced to reveal his plans in cabinet and a female spy immediately sent information of them across to beauregard whose strategic movement was consequent upon it mclellan did me the honour to say that i knew his plans better than president lincoln or his cabinet and had caused him four times to change them this was a matter of public notoriety amongst the yankees and fully believed but he gave me credit sometimes for more information than i possessed i was of course a close observer of the smallest indications and often drew accurate conclusions without having any precise knowledge on the subject i was in washington as the indian savage in the * forest with an enemy behind every bush my * faculties were under a painful tension and every instinct was quickened to follow the * and * of the ruthless foe who was hunting my race unto death and of course no word or indication was lost upon me i was very often at this period intruded upon by large parties of curious yankees who came with passes from the provostmarshal or governor of the district to stare at me sometimes i was amused and generally contrived to find out from these parties what was going on one set of men came introducing themselves as friends of mrs timothy childs as if this would furnish a passport to a southern womans confidence this party affected to be literary one of whom was editor of a * journal informed me that i was detained on account of my talents as a writer and classed me with * de * another large party came a few days after this the women very * dressed helped themselves very unceremoniously to cake which had been just sent to my little one a woman of this party who claimed boston as her residence made quite a furious onslaught upon me and said to me confess that it was love of notoriety which caused you to adopt your course and you have been certainly gratified for there is no one whom everybody has such a curiosity to see became very much excited and said a great deal more i told her that i had not supposed her object in visiting my prison was for the purpose of making a personal attack upon me but that she did not surprise me and afterwards i requested the superintendent not to allow any more of these parties to have access to me for the * of paris in the french revolution were before my mind and i feared that the next party might come armed with sticks or knives the superintendent told me that numbers daily came to the prison who would gladly give him ten dollars apiece to be allowed to pass my open door so as to obtain a view of the indomitable rebel as i was sometimes called in their papers this was being damned to immortality the disappointment of the abolitionists at manassas by no means diminished the zeal of the on to richmond party although it must always be borne in mind that the most bloodthirsty and desperate of these mercenary patriots were from the nature of their positions never likely to encounter the foe whom they affected to despise in the first battle of manassas it was terrible to read the accounts of the masked batteries and torpedoes and infernal machines described as buried by the rebels who were held up to the * of the civilised world for * to such unfair practices against a trusting foe who disdained the use of any but the most orthodox means of destruction poor rebels how bitterly they were denounced unblushingly now these same * avowed to the world that they had drawn on their imaginations in plain english had * most * that instead of the country for the space of twenty miles being enfiladed with masked batteries riflepits c as they have since only a few * defences of but little strength surmounted by wooden guns were found and by consequence forced to admit that the formidable defences and breastworks against which their mighty army had recoiled and fled like stricken hounds had been formed of a small band of enervated southerners whom they represented as an easy prey and so they had been for long years and the north had grown rich and intolerant upon its monopoly of their material wealth but now they were * together in the cause of their rights and spirited on by the lord of hosts to victory shrewd calculations were now entered into as to the time when this invincible grand army for they still adhered to the name would make its triumphant entry into richmond extracts were constantly published from the richmond examiner to prove the utter want of confidence of the populace in our president representing him as ruling with despotic power exposing every salient point our exhausted resources and want of munitions of war and other things which patriotism should have shrouded in silence had it all been true the examiner was also reported several times to have been suppressed by order of president davis on account as they said of its fearless exposure of his tyrannical government and our helpless condition was * by the victims of a despotism more absolute than that which imagination inflicted upon the confederacy so convinced was i of the injury which the examiner caused by * our internal differences and exposing our difficulties that on arriving at richmond i seriously asked the president why in view of the mischievous effects of this paper in giving aid and comfort to the enemy it had not been suppressed for that during the period of my imprisonment i had had ample opportunity to know the important information which they derived through its columns the reply of the president was * the head of a great nation better suffer from that evil which is temporary than arrest it by a still greater one it is a dangerous thing to interfere with the liberty of the press for what would it avail us if we gain our independence and lose our liberty letters were also passed about * to come from the ladies of our high officers and officials regretting the erroneous judgments of their bosom lords and all sighing after the fleshpots of egypt and mr john minor * quoted openly as authority for our demoralised condition and readiness to be taken into favour if the conquering army could once get to richmond but there was the rub the road to richmond was studied on the maps and it seemed very easy i had the one used by the military committee of the senate with the red dotted lines which they made of the route and thinking it might serve as a lesson to the confederate engineers sent it to manassas i have often wondered if that might not be the identical map supposed to have been furnished by general scotts coachman to their judgment the on to richmond was un fait * and our noble president already dragged at the wheels of the coach with purple hangings to grace the triumph of the immortal rail * this programme was only delayed who could doubt its fulfillment mr secretary chase borrowed money upon it the bulls and bears of wall street kept the ball constantly in motion richmond was the palestine of these modern * and the freedom of the negro their sepulchre of christ mclellan by order of the great secretary now made the third move in the programme of on to richmond by way of yorktown this was against his judgment but he however showed himself possessed of the first requisite of a soldier obedience to his superior he had an effective force of # men well appointed and disciplined somewhat it is true relaxed by the mistake at manassas and eager if we could judge from the boastful bragging tone for the onslaught the only opposing army at this time on the peninsula was the small but gallant band under magruder of eight or ten thousand men which he managed with such skill by marching and * as to give the idea of fifty or sixty thousand this estimate was constantly made by the yankees with this insignificant force he held mclellans whole army in check for two months upon the principle that one confederate was equal to five yankees i aided in the mystification by inadvertently supposing our force on the peninsula to be not less than # strong mclellan was evidently under the impression that a formidable force confronted him and set to work to * himself at a cost of # and demanded that reinforcements to the amount of 50000 men should be sent him from washington stanton haughtily replied to this requisition in the name of poor lincoln by * the force under his command and ordered him to fight the battle with the army he already had and plainly * that if he asked for any more men they would send him instead a commanding officer mclellan maintained the impossibility of his commencing offensive operations unless reinforced a correspondence between him and the great secretary ensued which created an active partisan warfare mclellans friends warmly espoused his cause and asserted boldly that it was stantons design to sacrifice him under this pressure of public feeling which was aided by the new york herald reinforcements were sent to mclellan but the order was * given and * executed it was determined although there were over 75000 men behind the fortifications of washington that none of these could be spared as the * of the capitol might be suddenly interrupted by a * of the rebel desperadoes how my blood * with satisfaction at the estimate they put upon the daring feats of our men the gallant ashby and his black horse cavalry were viewed with as much terror as the wild huntsman of the black forest thirty thousand men were at last * ordered to reinforce mclellan 10000 taken from each of the commands of banks * and shields banks accounted for his subsequent defeat by stonewall jackson from having had his command weakened by this reduction and the movement of his remaining forces impeded by the wagons c consequent upon the transfer of so large a body of troops meanwhile these stern * did not interrupt the merrymaking at the national capitol perhaps at no period of its history had there been such * indulgence of revelry and mirth the court journals gave a daily account of balls and dinners and * and exultingly proclaimed the fact that the abolition ladies could dress and dance and give suppers brilliant suppers in spite of the withdrawal of those secesh dames and demoiselles the * * and clays and the foreign ministers who were wont to sympathise with these fair traitors these gay doings ought to have been proof conclusive that there was nobody hurt even though the city authorities of new york and philadelphia found their resources strained to the utmost to give bread to the thousands of destitute and starving families in their midst and their hospitals were crowded to overflowing with wounded and dying soldiers the fashionable world of * was now put in a state of great excitement on account of the grand ball which mrs lincoln had resolved to give at the white house on february 9th the invitations had been issued a month in advance and the interest of the public kept alive by descriptions of the preparations as they progressed it was got up truly upon a scale of royal magnificence * was brought on from new york to superintend the supper and its * and the chevalier * was grand master of ceremonies and in order that nothing connected with the august entertainment which could enhance the general interest should be lost the new york herald published the card of invitation sent to mr and mrs james gordon bennett which they however had the good taste to decline dreading i suppose the irrepressible conflict the description of the ball in its various phases and the beautiful toilettes filled many columns of the papers for days after to the exclusion of the exciting news from the seat of war mrs lincolns costume received a large share of attention she was described as being dressed in court mourning that is with white and black rose and white and black lace * and commingled as a delicate compliment to queen victoria upon the death of prince albert her own son during this heartless pageant was lying at the point of death and a few days after breathed his last upon which occasion however she put on no mourning neither did she for the brother who fell afterwards fighting in defence of his home and fireside these festivities at the national capitol were intended to divert the public mind from too close a scrutiny of the policy of the government the * observer supposed that all the energy of their rulers was directed to the reduction of richmond mclellan was unsophisticated enough to suppose that he had been sent to the peninsula for the accomplishment of that end and he addressed himself to the task with great caution and not much relish for it he would greatly have preferred to remain in washington during its season of festivities enjoying the clat and * of the hour he however proceeded to take the necessary measures for the advance of his army he had the good sense never to have * the enemy he had to encounter on the contrary he magnified our force and capabilities beyond what our modesty would have allowed us to claim on our own behalf mclellan rightly judged that the only chance of success was to overwhelm us by numbers hence his requisition on the war department at washington for reinforcements which when conceded under force of the outside pressure were several weeks before reaching him thus forcing him whilst waiting for them to extend and strengthen his original line of intrenchments and fortifications to protect his army from the attack momentarily expected to be made by general johnson who had been by this delay enabled to relieve magruder and his gallant band from the critical position they were in for there is no doubt that had mclellan advanced upon them they must have been cut to pieces they represented themselves as being somewhat in the condition of admiral * army mere shadows from the severe marching and flying about to which they were subjected by magruder in order to deceive the enemy during this period of digging and * of the grand army the great secretary issued one of those remarkable * proclaiming a great battle and a great victory at yorktown and as was usual a map and description of the seat of war appeared in all the yankee papers i confess to some uneasy feeling on the subject until a friend in the war department sent me copy of the genuine despatch from mclellan imploring reinforcements mr stantons was a * ruse and proved very successful for mr chase was enabled thereby to effect another considerable loan i wrote a letter describing this same operation which was mailed in baltimore and captured in the postoffice of that city and was afterwards shown me by general dix at the time of my mock trial before him for treason the government at washington never intended that mclellan should advance beyond yorktown he had played the rle designed for him and they were now determined to rid themselves of him even though they should also sacrifice the army under his command in preparation for this defeat the transports were kept in a convenient position and the gunboats lay ready to cover the retreat of his forces the evacuation of yorktown by johnson was conducted in a masterly manner the enemy were in complete ignorance of his design until it had been entirely accomplished held in check again by a few wooden guns general johnson however had the magnanimity to leave for their enlightenment an intelligent contraband well posted as to his future movements and the policy and views generally of the confederate government at this time a very important character arrived at the metropolis in the person of president daviss negro coachman i was not informed whether president lincoln and his * mr seward invited him to dinner but i do know that he had frequent interviews with them the result of which was given to the curious public through the press as conversations between the president and mrs davis during their evening drives he also said that richmond would be evacuated on the first sign of the approach of the abolition army and that president davis had had a subterranean passage made so as to secure his own escape these ridiculous stories were * swallowed and implicit credit given to them in truth there was nothing too wild or extravagant for these northern fanatics to seize hold of and the government offered a premium for this species of romance as a sort of * for their own ulterior policy i became now seriously alarmed about the health and life of my child day by day i saw her fading away her round chubby face radiant with health had become pale as marble the pupils of her eyes were unnaturally dilated and finally a slow nervous fever seized upon her i implored in vain both verbally and in writing that a physician might be sent and finally wrote the following letter to the provostmarshal a few hours after i had despatched this note my door was rudely thrown open and dr stewart the * sergeant as he signed himself unceremoniously entered saying madam i come to see you on official business i said sir it ought to be of a very grave character to warrant this intrusion he seated himself his hospital steward standing near the door madam did you write a letter to the provostmarshal this day yes i wrote to the provostmarshal but i have yet to learn how you a subordinate dare question me in regard to any correspondence i may hold with your superior madam i have every right you have caused me to be rebuked by major allen and general porter for neglect of duty c i said sir in my letter to general porter there was not the most distant reference to you i asked that dr mmillen might visit my child knowing him to be a man of science and a gentleman and my note furnished no warrant for general porter to rebuke you as to major allen his impertinence is only equalled by your own at this moment he replied madam i will believe general porter in preference to you i thereupon arose from my seat and said sir i have borne with you quite as long as is consistent with my selfrespect and i now desire you to quit my room as it is no part of my plan to submit to personal insult he arose also foaming with rage and stood confronting me almost a giant in size and said i will not quit your room i am here by order of brigadiergeneral porter sir i command you to go out if you do not i will summon the officer of the guard and the superintendent to put you out with that he attempted to lay hands upon my child i interposed my own person and said at your peril but touch my child you are a coward and no gentleman thus to insult a woman i will not go out of your room madam he said this time livid and trembling with rage or fear i dont know which i then went to the door and rapped for be it remembered that he was locked and bolted in my room that being the humane and christian order call the officer of the guard the sentinel on duty being a friendly one no time was lost in summoning him when the officer appeared and the door was opened it happened to be that same lieutenant carlton from * ohio he was very much agitated for this man was his superior officer i said sir i order you to put this man out of my room for conduct unworthy of an officer and a gentleman and i will report you for having allowed him to enter here he nervously rubbed his hands and said i am sure dr stewart will come out if you wish it sir i said do your duty order your guard to put him out the sergeant corporal and guard who all hated stewart for his arrogance were eager to obey whereupon this valiant dr stewart actually slunk out strange to say this scene filled me with uncontrollable laughter it was farcical in the extreme this display of valour against a sick child and careworn woman prisoner a few hours later the kind and good dr mmillen came in accompanied by an officer but under orders not to hold any conversation with me save that which was professional i felt it incumbent upon me to report dr stewarts visit to the provostmarshal the following is a copy general johnsons wise and judicious falling back from yorktown completely upset the plans and purposes of the abolition directory at washington and forced upon them an entire change of policy to suit the new emergency their determination with regard to mclellan was necessarily suspended although not weakened in the slightest degree but their own political existence depended upon the employment or defeat of the vast army under mclellan which was now # strong to recall him at that juncture was to have him proclaimed military dictator to avoid this danger a vigorous prosecution of the on to richmond was imperative homesteads in the south were offered to that horde of barbarians who swarmed like * over the fairest fields of virginia desolating them as they advanced and spurred on with the hope of possession and visions of orange groves and fair southern wives this is no imaginary picture wilson of massachusetts said few of that army our boys as he called them will ever return to the north that they would have homesteads given them in the conquered country that congress would * the land into quarter sections that they would settle and marry southern girls to which i replied never sir but our negroes will go north and marry yours as far more fitting * wilson in this instance proved a true prophet but not in the sense he intended few of that vandal crew ever returned to the north but instead of homes in the sunny south under the vine and the * they found bloody graves amid the swamps of the * where their bodies lie * unburied their bones bleaching in the sun and a nations * as their funeral dirge general andrew porter the provostmarshal who had distinguished himself by the most wanton invasion of the rights of the people of the district accompanied mclellan to the field followed by his bloodhounds allen and his gang of detectives porter was succeeded by a mr biddle roberts who signed himself with as many titles as a spanish * and determined to convince me in the outset that i had gained nothing by the exchange stanton had the grace to give an order that members of my family should visit me without the restrictions which had been hitherto imposed this however displeased the provostmarshal and detective police who determined to deprive me of the power of making known this concession and took upon themselves still to refuse all passes to see me the following is a copy of a letter which i wrote to mrs s a douglas which was returned to me about the beginning of february a woman named ada * daughter of a mechanic of alexandria calling herself mrs morris mason was brought to the prison she had however never been married although the mother of two children one of whom died a few days prior to her arrest the immediate cause which led to her arrest was a letter written by her to seward claiming his protection from the attentions of colonel * the fatherinlaw of mclellan with whom she assumed to have established previously very amicable relations seward after consultation with mclellan had her incarcerated in order to avoid a family scandal mrs william henry norris of baltimore was also confined at the old capitol as a prisoner she was a most excellent lady was detained about two weeks and was released upon parole through the influence of the hon reverdy johnson the new regulations allowing half an hour in the prison yard had only gone into operation a few days before mrs norris left so that it was but a brief pleasure that i enjoyed in her society on march 6th general wordsworth called to see me in his character of governor of the district the first appointment of the kind made by abraham the first consequently the provostmarshal became simply chief of police without other authority a subordinate officer major * was appointed to the place general wordsworth was gentlemanly and kind and seemingly recognised the right of a prisoner to be treated with humanity and respect he appeared greatly surprised to hear of the system pursued towards myself and child and ordered that i should enjoy as a right the usual exercise allotted to other prisoners also that my child should have the privilege of going outside the walls accompanied by an officer but it was one thing to make humane laws and another to have them executed the love of tyranny had become too strong a passion within those walls to be easily abolished any appeal required two or three days to reach the proper quarter each subordinate officer took upon himself to interpret the rules and corporals and * assumed the airs of their chiefs and had to be daily instructed for alas we were only rebels and inhaled the air by * the vexations and annoyances on this head were unceasing the most brutal of the officers with whom i was brought in contact was captain gilbert of the #* pennsylvania volunteers the same who had drilled the negroes and lieutenant carlton of * ohio the most humane and kind were captain higgins and lieutenant miller of new jersey these gentlemen merit the consideration of every prisoner for the reluctance with which they obeyed the harsh orders of their superiors and if the chances of war ever throw them in our midst i should deem it a privilege by every means in my power to ameliorate their condition one day on going down in the yard the market cart of the superintendent had just come in my friend charlie who drove it said will you take a ride i immediately got in the other female prisoners following my example exclaiming i am off for dixie and charlie drove rapidly around the yard it is impossible to describe the panic and confusion which ensued all the prisoners rushed to the windows to enjoy the scene the officer of the guard captain gilbert also rushed out crying with might and main stop that * the guard were doubled all around the yard and i believe were actually preparing to fire upon us after driving around the enclosure two or three times we drew up in front of our redoubtable captain who verily believed that an escape had been * and that his timely intervention had alone frustrated it march 10 the greatest dismay and anxiety was felt at washington on account of the extraordinary prowess of the merrimac or the virginia as she had been newly christened the war department forbade the publication of her glorious achievements one entire edition of a baltimore paper was suppressed from having contained a graphic account of the engagement in spite of these vigilant efforts it became widely spread and mr seward even awoke to the conviction that there was something the matter and recommended to the governors of the northeastern states the subject of their coast defences the chamber of commerce of new york hastily convened to take into consideration the harbour defences of that city each night the abolition government at washington retired with the dread anticipation of seeing in the morning the norfolk * lying off the potomac ready to shell the white house the abolitionists hastily sent off their # families and a special train waited several days with steam up ready to bear off lincoln and his cabinet quite an excitement was created throughout the prison about this time by the arrest of a woman in male attire she was apprehended at the hotel of a man named * in washington who * for her died a few days prior to her arrival her object had been to go to richmond with the proffer of a * which her husband who was in england had invented the model of which she had in her trunk * was to have forwarded her over she was very handsome and was a woman of some cultivation and scientific attainments she was a keen observer and both spoke and wrote well her room was adjoining mine and although there was a double door between i was enabled to converse and pass communications through the keyhole this had been arranged by a skilful use of the penknife by the gentlemen who had been removed for this prisoner in order that we might in turn avail ourselves of each others facilities in sending communications out of the prison mrs * was the name of this person and apart from her costume there was nothing about her but was calculated to inspire respect as her conduct was marked by great modesty and propriety she was a * in politics had supreme contempt for the abolition government and sneeringly enumerated its lawless acts in support of her * that sooner or later all republican forms of government resolved themselves into unlimited * i was not tempted to * this position being as it was entirely in accordance with my own experience of this most perfect government the sun ever shone upon she demanded her freedom as there was no proof against her and for want of proof she was after a few weeks imprisonment discharged i admired her spirit and independence and wish her well wherever she may be this lady laid before the government the most horrible outrage committed in that old capitol prison too dreadful too revolting to be mentioned here she also wrote to miss dix with whom she was well acquainted describing the foul act which caused mr * of war watson to come to the prison under pretext of an investigation which shifted the crime and responsibility from one set of officers and men to another and was in fact a humbug gotten up by the superintendent wood for the purpose of clearing himself and * the excitement consequent upon the dark deed extracts from my journal march 18 this day the united states commissioners for the trial of state prisoners general dix and governor fairfield called upon me accompanied by their secretary and several subordinate officers and were introduced most * by dr stewart or * as he is now called in the prison i had known general dix formerly very well he was one of the few northern politicians in whose integrity i entertained any confidence or for whom i felt any respect he advanced most kindly and courteously towards me introducing his colleague and said that he had come in his capacity of united states commissioner to ascertain my wishes and offer his * and services and would be heartily glad to be able to serve me as an old friend i thanked him and replied that he had always had my most profound respect but in his capacity of minister of a tyrant i could accept no service other than that he would present my simple demand for justice against his government he said that he regretted deeply to see my feelings so much embittered against the government whose flag we had alike honoured in other days that he had come here for the purpose of * into the condition of state prisoners would enter upon the examination of my case and set all things right and particularly desired to serve me i said that i believed in the mosaic law which exacted an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth i have been now nearly eight months a prisoner i am not prepared to say whether i will appear before you in your capacity of commissioner i deny the power of your government lawfully to deprive me of my legal rights and as to that old flag there was a time when i looked upon it as the proudest emblem of human freedom on earth and have in other lands bowed before it in holy reverence but now there is no pirate flag that floats upon the sea which is not more honourable in my eye for none covers such infamy general dix made some * reply and turned to my child who was lying flushed with fever on her bed of straw i told him she was in need of food and air for in spite of general wordsworths order the quarrels between the superintendent dent and the officer still kept her pent up in that foul atmosphere he laid his hand softly upon her and said why she has fever i said yes sir he said here is a physician i replied i have sent for one and decline the services of that gentleman he looked pityingly upon her and upon me and i thanked god that lincoln had not often employed agents such as he so soon as general dix and party got outside of my door the pentup wrath of dr stewart broke out and he launched against me the most bitter * i approached general dix and said sir i claim your protection against this indignity i believed you ignorant of the conduct of this man else you would never have allowed him to attach himself to your suite and enter my room from which i was forced to call upon the officer of the guard to expel him for conduct unworthy of a man upon a former occasion and i now demand that you put an end to this scene dr stewart with wonderful pertinacity attempted to go on but general dix and governor fairfield each said stop sir and retire if you please which he was accordingly obliged to do and i confess i enjoyed his crestfallen discomfited look more than any incident of the day march 19 it may be supposed that visions of freedom mingled with my dreams that night far otherwise was the case i had an uneasy feeling that so far as i was concerned it was only intended to * over their tyranny and afford a pretext for still greater oppression i knew the chiefs of the abolition government too well to believe that humanity would guide their counsels the consciences of these gentlemen never struggled with a maxim of state and i had unfortunately penetrated too deeply into their real plans and designs for the future to make them feel satisfied of the wisdom of releasing me stanton had avowed himself averse to the policy of the government on the subject of arbitrary arrest yet he contented himself and quieted his conscience by being a passive spectator of the unlawful acts of his coadjutors he was in fact too busy with his own schemes of personal * and safety for he was by no means blind to the frail tenure of his official dignity he was a man however of inordinate vanity and great * * he had been a democrat on entering the abolition cabinet he believed that he could shape its policy to suit his own ends his first object had been to force mclellan to resign his own appointment had been made as a conciliatory measure towards pennsylvania with this contingency in view that accomplished stantons political programme was all mapped out for his aspirations were directed towards being the candidate of the conservative party for president in 1864 he had sagacity enough to see that the reckless course of the faction who now controlled the destinies of the nation would either end in the entire overthrow of even the semblance of a constitutional form of government and the establishment of an unlimited despotism or a revolution in which the conservative element would * the discontent which very generally prevailed at this time encouraged the belief that this latter was more than problematical although the most rigid measures were taken by the government to suppress every demonstration by the establishment of the severest * of the press and the imprisonment of everyone who dared to question its decrees stanton had resolved that his resignation of his office should be consequent upon the signing of the bill for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia by lincoln calculating that this defiant act would rally around him at once a party strong enough to divert the current of events into the channel he desired but the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft * mclellan still meekly held on to his place in spite of the continued * put upon him with a blind faith in the destiny which was to help him out of the slough and lead him on to glory the conservative party still sustained him in this dilemma stanton had one of two * before him that of resigning his position and retiring from the political arena content to believe that a righteous act would bring its own reward or to plunge into the gulf of abolitionism upon whose poisonous and loathsome waters integrity and honour and honesty shrivelled and died judge black was said to have been his steady counsellor and friend during this season of indecision and to have spirited him on by apt quotations from his favourite author * to take the fatal leap hence his resignation which had been written out was thrown into the fire and he immersed himself in that foul pool and entered the list of the champions for honours to be achieved by the sacrifice of the government they affected to be waging war to uphold * whether in religion or politics are universally acknowledged to exceed in zeal or fanaticism the original professors in politics this is peculiarly the case as the * feels that his antecedents being against him he is specially called upon by some signal act of devotion to inspire confidence in his new associates hence we see greater activity infused into the councils of the abolition government and a more demoniac policy announced for the future prosecution of the war of subjugation the flimsy mask which a wholesome dread of the worlds opinion had forced them thus far to wear was thrown off and the chances which a servile war would * in their favour openly discussed and lincoln seward stanton and their * * in cold blood over the horrors from which to their minds there was no escape for the women

shield over our young nation extracts from my journal march 25 this day i received a summons to appear before the united states commissioners for the trial of state prisoners i decided to obey the summons as i felt some curiosity to know in what manner the trial would be conducted what was the nature of the charges against me and to what results it would be likely to lead it was one of those raw uncomfortable days in which the cold penetrated to the marrow the sun was obscured by clouds as dark as yankee deeds and heavy flakes of snow were falling thick and fast as i drove through the avenue from the prison to the provost marshals office which was at the other end of the city the filth and desolation were appalling for even in those first days of the occupation the effects had not been so visible however i had no time for reflection upon the contrast which the present and the past presented as by this time the carriage drew near the provostmarshals but here truly was there room for comparison this had been the house of mrs gwin one of the most elegant and agreeable in the city and as i passed up through the filthy halls and stairs and the filthy crowd of soldiers and civilians who lined the way my mind instinctively reverted to the gay and brilliant scenes in which i had mingled in that house and the goodly company who had enjoyed its hospitality i was conducted to the third story and put in room without fire and kept there until my hands and feet were completely benumbed with cold a guard was stationed at the door who rattled his musket in order that i should have a comfortable sense of his proximity numbers of officers in gay uniforms came in upon one pretext or another in order to stare at me i was detained in this manner for nearly an hour when the superintendent of the old capitol prison mr wood in whose custody i was still regarded as being came to conduct me before the commissioners whose presence i reached with difficulty a passage being forced for me to pass through the soldiers who filled the * arriving before the door of the room in which the commissioners held their * it was thrown open my name announced and the commissioners advanced to receive me with illconcealed embarrassment i bowed to them saying gentlemen resume your seats for they were still standing i recognise the embarrassment of your positions it was a mistake in your government to have selected gentlemen for this mission you have however shown me but scant courtesy in having kept me waiting your pleasure for nearly an hour in the cold they * protesting their ignorance of my arrival c some few complimentary remarks followed and i now took a survey of the scene a large table was placed in the middle of the room at the upper end of which sat general dix and at the other extremity governor fairfield mr webster private secretary of mr seward as secretary of the commission sat at a small table a little to the left of general dix and two other persons at a similar table to the rear of governor fairfield my own seat was midway between the commissioners in full view of the whole party large piles of papers lay before general dix which he fingered uneasily and seemed uncertain what to do governor fairfield made some unimportant remark to which i replied i suppose this is a mimic court and i can answer or not according to my own discretion one of the reporters now said if you please to speak louder madam i rose from my seat and said to general dix if it is your object to make a spectacle of me and furnish reports for the newspapers i shall have the honour to withdraw from this presence hereupon both of the commissioners arose and protested that they had no such intention but that it was necessary to take notes in order to lay before the president and congress i then resumed my seat and governor fairfield continued in a strain in no respects different from that of an ordinary conversation held in a drawingroom and to which i replied * or * as suited my purpose and a careless listener would have imagined that the commissioner was endeavouring with plausible argument to defend the government rather than * me finally and after it had continued some time i said but when is this dreadful ordeal this trial for treason which has been heralded to the world with so much circumstance to commence for i can scarcely believe that i have been brought from my prison on this inclement day for the purpose of this very * and irrelevant conversation or be induced to regard it in the light of a formal trial for life liberty and estate * of blood and all the other ills of feudal times at this the subordinates laughed outright governor fairfield coloured attempted to speak several times and changed his mind and finally said general dix you are so much better acquainted with mrs greenhow suppose you continue the examination i laughingly said commence it for i hold that it has not begun general dix turned over and over again the papers before him which were my letters seized by the detective police and which though * to the subjectmatter had no legal importance or bearing at this time he selected one laying his hand upon it but still hesitated i watched him keenly at last he said you are charged with treason i deny it sir during the eight months of my imprisonment i have had ample time to study the constitution of the united states and there is no act or provision in it which will justify a charge of that nature against me and so you deny the charge of treason i do sir most emphatically and moreover retort the charge against yourself as being the minister of a president who has violated the constitution destroyed the personal rights of the citizen and inaugurated revolution at this moment sir you are presiding at and conducting a trial unlawful in every sense and without even a presence of the legal form prescribed for the constitution of the united states is very precise and specific as to the mode in which a trial for treason shall be conducted it requires that the charge for treason shall be sustained by two respectable witnesses which you could not find in all yankeedom he then held up the letter which he had selected i immediately recognised it as the one i had caused to be mailed in baltimore and to which i have before alluded i held out my hand saying let me see it after a moment of indecision he gave it to me i glanced my eye over its contents and returned it to him saying it is rather a clever letter is it not general dix replied mrs greenhow requires no new testimony in favour of her ability in the use of her pen i bowed my head and said well general what next have you to say you are charged madam with having caused a letter which you wrote to the secretary of state to be published in richmond that can scarcely be brought forward as one of the causes for my arrest as i was some three months a prisoner when that letter was written and i myself regarded its undue publicity prior to its publication at richmond as a grave cause of complaint against the secretary of state you are charged madam with holding communication with the enemy in the south if this were an established fact you could not be surprised at it i am a southern woman and i thank god that no drop of yankee blood ever polluted my veins and as all that i have ever honoured or respected have been driven by ruthless despotism to seek shelter there it would seem the most natural thing in life that i should have done so how is it madam that you have managed to communicate in spite of the vigilance exercised over you that is my secret sir and if it be any satisfaction to you to know it i shall in the next fortyeight hours make a report to my government at richmond of this rather farcical trial for treason general mclellan madam charges you with having obtained a thorough knowledge of his plans and of forcing him consequently four times to change them at this i smilingly shrugged my shoulders without reply saying well what else after a few moments general dix said governor i think we have nothing else to say to * to which governor fairfield replied no sir i think not of course i do not pretend to relate the entire conversation for it could not be called an examination but have gleaned the most important points i now said it seems to me a little extraordinary that after such grave charges as that of penetrating cabinet secrets and * and * the plans of commanding generals no curiosity should have been felt to arrive at the source of my socalled treason if only as a measure of * for the future as it is but reasonable to suppose i must have had able coadjutors high in the national councils and that this information must have sought me at my own house as it can be clearly established that i have never crossed the threshold of a * oh that reminds me resumed general dix did lieutenant sheldon ever take out communications for you oh certainly by authority of the provostmarshal but if you wish to * lieutenant sheldon you had better send for him and question him on that subject as i certainly should not betray him or anyone else who might have rendered me a service general dix asked where is lieutenant sheldon mr webster replied with his regiment in virginia general dix then said i shall be very glad to serve you madam and shall certainly advise the government to allow you to go south or consult your wishes in any other respects that he regretted deeply my extreme bitterness for which he could see no reason c i replied that is the difference between * and * i have been now eight months a prisoner subject during that period to every insult and outrage which * tyranny could * my property stolen and destroyed shut up in close imprisonment and actually suffering the torments of hunger to this treatment has my child of eight years been also exposed thereby seriously * her health not content with this i have been daily assailed in the journals of the administration and sought to be dragged down to the level of the inmates of your white house knowing me then as you do it will not seem strange that instead of crushing this system should have excited my contemptuous defiance and undying hatred on examining this evidence you can but smile at the absurdity of the charges and the extreme care not to extract any information from me i have however sir to return my most sincere thanks to you and your colleague for the delicacy and kind feeling which has characterised your bearing towards me and to congratulate you upon the conclusion of a task which can be but little in unison with the feelings of gentlemen thereupon both commissioners advanced and shook hands and expressed an earnest hope that i would very soon be sent south march 26 this evening mr wood came to my room to announce that the reporter who took down the examination was below and requested to see me i authorised him to bring him up he came to ask my permission to furnish a report of the proceedings to the newspapers saying that a new york and a philadelphia paper had each offered him five hundred dollars for it and as the curiosity was very great to see it it would be impossible to prevent accounts of some sort from getting out i told him that i had no objection for anything i had said to be known my only desire being to avoid newspaper notoriety besides verbatim reports very rarely did justice c he replied on the contrary madam yours is calculated to make a great impression it has been read before the commissioners and official authorities and the highest * bestowed upon it he opened his papers and read some portions of it which read smoothly enough and were certainly sufficiently explicit so i withdrew my objection as to its publication that same night this person received a peremptory order from secretary seward under penalty of imprisonment and heavy fine not to furnish any article on the subject for the press authorised statements however came out in all of the papers that the * mrs greenhow had made a full confession of her * c on 30th march i received a letter from mrs s a douglas in which she said i do believe you have a stern joy in your martyrdom else you would embrace the opportunity to escape from it the following is a copy of my reply april 2 the examination of the various state prisoners was still going on before the commissioners great excitement of course existed in the prison the superintendent amused himself by practising upon the hopes and fears of the prisoners he has persuaded harry stewart that he will be sentenced as a spy april 3 the superintendent this evening read me a copy of the decree of the commissioners in reference to me the following is a copy of a letter of mine to the military governor on the subject general wordsworth sent me a verbal answer to this communication denying me the privilege i asked saying that my capacity for observing was too great and that i would be sure to obtain information valuable to the confederacy also that he could not grant me the time or other facilities for preparation i thereupon wrote to stanton who gave instructions that certain parties should have access to me the few days i had asked having expired and receiving no notice of the intention of the government on the important subject of my departure and seeing very frequent allusions to myself in the papers i addressed the following the new york herald published a statement that i had protested against being sent away preferring to remain a prisoner in washington i wrote to bennett enclosing a copy of the above with the following note my serious apprehensions were now excited in regard to the intentions of the yankee government i had no faith in any offer or promise from them and i could * no satisfactory information from the subordinate officers who approached me and rumours reached me from outside that they again contemplated sending me to fort warren extract from my notes sunday morning april 28 this very hour eleven oclock a prisoner mr * of maryland has been murdered in cold blood by a sentry he was standing at his window singing and the sentinel who was walking on his beat in the yard below turned and deliberately shot him it has been my fate woman as i am to have had a loaded musket pointed at my breast and god alone knows what would have been my fate had the superintendent of this prison not interposed this appalling murder would be a reason if no other existed to make me wish to have the decree of the commissioners acted upon in good faith on 21st of april i addressed the following note to general wordsworth military governor of the district to this i received no response although it was by the superintendent of the prison placed in general wordsworths hands on the #* of april the honourable mr ely came to call upon me and seemed * bent on serving me in some way he said that he had been well and kindly treated at richmond where he had been as a prisoner since the battle of bull run and he had come to see what he could do for me i told him that the only service i could receive from him was to ascertain from his government the reasons for my detention after the notification i had received and what they intended to do on the 26th he again called upon me he told me that general wordsworth informed him that the order for my detention had been given by mclellan who objected to my release on the grounds that i knew his plans better than lincoln c c and that he did not wish me sent south at this time ely brought with him a new york paper commenting harshly upon his visit to a lady who had done the national cause so much injury and hoping that he would not repeat it as his patriotism would be damaged by it in the public estimation c he told me that this paper was brought to his seat by a member of congress with a friendly admonition against the repetition of the imprudence ely said that he took out the pass he had and said i am going to see mrs greenhow at this moment and will do all i can to resist this fanatical persecution for they did not treat me so at richmond on taking leave he asked me for my carte de * which i gave him and said madam i will call again to see if i can be of use c c i replied no you will be refused a pass they are afraid lest my fearless denunciations of their * may open the eyes of their followers and make them question the orthodoxy of abolitionism i subsequently learned through a message from ely that my prediction had been verified for on application again for a pass to visit me it had been refused and this was the last i heard of the honourable mr ely the tedium of my prison life at this time was greater than i can depict and i now also began to realise the fact that my physical health was being gradually undermined by want of exercise and want of proper food a feeling of * was stealing over me and a nervous * which prevented me from sleeping my childs health was failing alarmingly also i had nothing to read and even the newspapers were served or not according to the caprice of my * and were very sure to be withheld whenever they contained southern news my room swarmed with vermin which the warm weather now caused to come out in myriads from their * and although at this time allowed the halfhour exercise in the prison yard i could not regard it as relaxation for the yard was filled with the stolen negroes who lay about obstructing the walk or engaged in boisterous practical jokes during the while in utter disregard of social distinction and even ventured to seat themselves on the same bench and i must also add that the association with the women prisoners was but a shade less obnoxious than that of this degraded servile class each day brought some collision between them and the guard which was mortifying to me in the extreme the guard were at this time often extremely insolent and questioned the slightest rule of privilege so that it was necessary to make constant appeals to the officer on duty one day on going down the guard very rudely placed his musket before me and said you shall not go down that way and ordered me to go by a dirty back * which was not the usual route i immediately sent for the officer of the guard lieutenant miller who passed me down some time after the woman baxley and the one calling herself mrs morris or mason attempted to go down and were also stopped by the guard with whom they entered into an angry contest and resolved in defiance to force their way through them morris was pushed into a corner and held there by a bayonet crossed before her whilst the more daring of the two baxley seized on the musket that obstructed her passage and attempted to pass under it the guard cursed her she struck him in the face which caused his nose to bleed and he knocked her down and kicked her attracted by the commotion i went up under escort of lieutenant miller when this statement was given to me and to the officer by the women amidst sobs and cries the guard also who witnessed it giving substantially the same account thus it will be seen that i must have suffered much from this humiliating association captain higgins came up to speak with me on the subject greatly mortified at the occurrence and said that he would punish the guard if he could have any justification in doing so i told him that i thought it was a case which he could not take * of as he could only regard it as a fight between a prisoner and a guard in which the prisoner was the * captain higgins then implored those prisoners to have no words with his guard but to appeal to him in case of insolence or disrespect and that they should be summarily punished at this time i occasionally saw members of my family who were admitted to see me under the special order to that effect from secretary stanton although the privilege was necessarily used with great caution as all who were known to be my friends were in consequence put under the surveillance of the detective police the health of my child troubled me greatly all her * was gone and she would now lie for hours upon my lap with mamma tell me a story and with a heavy heart i have often beguiled her with wild and * legends until she would fall into feverish slumbers in my arms finally i resolved to make another appeal in behalf of my family physician being permitted to visit her and wrote to general wordsworth on the subject stating her condition c general wordsworth upon the receipt of my note and the endorsement by the superintendent of the alarming condition of the child gave orders that dr miller who was himself under surveillance should have a special order to visit me dr miller upon visiting me found the condition of the child critical and represented to the general the necessity of her having more nutritious food also air and exercise and thenceforward she was taken out very generally for a short time each day by one or other of the officers captain higgins lieutenant miller and lieutenant holmes were each very kind to rose they seemed to be ashamed of the persecution which could go so far as to threaten the life of a little child of eight years several federal officers were at this time confined as prisoners for various offences one dr cox a surgeon in the regular united states army was arrested for disloyalty to the government and sympathy with the rebels i had a great deal of conversation with this officer through the keyhole of his door the room being the same which had been occupied by mrs * he was the son of dr cox of philadelphia and a man of cultivation after some weeks of imprisonment his resignation which had been previously tendered was accepted and he was liberated on parole the others wore mostly german officers taken up for stealing or * the term brought in vogue by cameron one the chief of * * staff a mr morton * of the state of new york was a prisoner by order of seward whose deadly animosity he had excited poor man he was most * treated and was gradually dying from the effects of it the keenest sympathy of all the prisoners was excited on his behalf he was allowed communication with no one not even his wife and when his halfhour of exercise in the prison yard came round everyone was driven in as if he had been stricken with the * and a solitary walk prescribed in sight but out of reach of communion with the guards even i frequently sent out letters for him but as he was in solitary confinement it was very difficult and required the cooperation of several persons the process was this when morton went down in the yard he would watch his opportunity to bow to me i having been previously notified that he was below if i had an opportunity to communicate outside i would hold up a letter if not would shake my head and bitterly would my heart ache when i would see the desponding manner with which the poor fellow would let his head fall upon his breast when i would give the negative signal by means of a string he would pass his letter to captain * bryan csa who would pass it by a similar process to dr cox usa from whom it would reach me my anxiety was at this time intense to receive correct information from the confederacy things of vast importance were * and although i had long since discarded all faith in yankee accounts of current events being well satisfied of their * character i knew too well the power and * of the government arrayed for the purpose of crushing us to lull myself into a false security or even momentary forgetfulness of the perils which threatened us on all sides in spite of our continued successes gloom hangs over our devoted land what matters it that we repulse the vandals at every point the battle of shiloh where the brave and accomplished sidney johnson fell and which would have decided the fate of europe was scarcely felt by the invaders who take no account of human life so long as their shattered ranks are filled up by the outcasts of civilised europe and so long as greedy speculators and contractors are reaping * in greenbacks the fate of new orleans at this time made me weep tears of blood oh better that she had buried her whole population under her smoking ruins than to have been given over a bloodless victory to the invaders and from my soul i pray that heavy retribution may fall upon the * in the dark tragedy may 1 the abolition general butler is in command of new orleans this man is perhaps better fitted to execute the wholesale order of

faculties in widening the breach and * sectional animosities he advocated the dissolution of the union as one of the inevitable necessities of lincolns election and no man hurled bolder defiance at the abolition party or denounced the * of their measures in more unequivocal terms he proclaimed the doctrine of the inalienable rights of the south and * resistance as the last measure of * this man remained in the councils of the southern party up to a late hour and heartily concurred in the justice of the doom of the * john brown one of the first administrative acts which emanated from brigadiergeneral butler as military commander of new orleans was the order no 28 commanding that the whole female population of that city should be subjected to outrage and infamy as common women of the town comment hereupon would be out of place the shuddering abhorrence with which the whole civilised world received its * is the best record of this mans crimes to nations yet * another of those northern democrats caleb cushing who had been president of the charleston convention asked me at the time that the virginia convention was in cession if i thought that the ordinance of secession would be passed i said yes as i knew that certain measures were in contemplation by the abolition government which would make it imperative alluding to the call for 75000 men then being urged upon lincoln he replied i am very glad to hear it i feared that virginia would decide upon armed neutrality and the south in my opinion has no other alternative in this crisis in order to maintain her own dignity and independence but to secede her northern friends and supporters have a right to expect that she will not back down c further conversation on this head followed and i was so much impressed with his strong southern views and sympathies that i almost forgot that this man had once written and printed puffs * of himself a few months later when the fanatical abolition war fever was at its height caleb cushing asked to be appointed brigadiergeneral in the abolition army in order to aid in the subjugation of a people whom he had recommended to resort to arms as the only means left to them for the preservation of their rights and to drive the invader from their soil o consistency thou art a jewel unknown to northern * lincoln refused him the appointment not having confidence in the * of this last act of faith so i was informed by senator wilson of massachusetts this was the gloomiest period of my life time dragged most heavily i had absolutely nothing to occupy myself with i had no books and often no paper to write on and those who approached me appeared entirely oblivious of the mental as well as physical wants of a prisoner my imprisonment seemed destined to be indefinitely prolonged hope even had fled and left me chafing against my prison bars with the iron of the despot eating into my soul i contrived to elude the vigilance of my gaolers which was now greater than ever and send a note to the honourable james m bayard united states senator from delaware with a request that he would ascertain what was to be my fate for the doubt and uncertainty which hung over me was more trying to me than the darkest reality mr bayard in pursuance of my request went to general wordsworth the military governor of the district and was told by him that mclellan had countermanded the order for sending me south and protested against it on the ground that i knew his plans better than lincoln having caused him four times to change them and demanded that i should be held a prisoner for the war thus repeating substantially the old story mr bayard also obtained a pass to visit me by reason of his having been a classmate of wordsworths meanwhile every species of annoyance was put upon me my friends on calling at the provostmarshals were often informed that i had been gone south some several weeks and their newspapers published characteristic paragraphs about me sometimes that i vehemently protested against leaving washington at others that i had made a full confession of my treason in answer to a paragraph that went the rounds on this head and which was copied into the baltimore news sheet i wrote the following extracts from my notes in old capitol prison saturday may 10 this day at five oclock the yankees formally took possession of norfolk our troops having evacuated it in the forenoon * events seem rapidly chasing each other at first i did not credit it the yankee papers having for the last ten days heralded the important event the virginia the noble virginia also destroyed i would rather have lost both of my hands than to be obliged to write this fact as un fait * the exultation of the yankees and their insolence are beyond all description strange no feeling of despondency is in my heart my confidence in the ultimate result the achievement of our independence is strong as the faith planted on the rock of ages and even in this dark hour the star of hope rises steadily beyond the gloom guiding us on to victory and to empire these great calamities have been permitted in order to arouse our people to a full sense of their peril and to corresponding measures of resistance against our ruthless invaders altogether this has been a dark day in the prison it may perhaps be well to say that my notes are principally in cipher captain bryan and harry stewart are going to escape tonight the attempt to be made when the guard whom they have bribed comes on at midnight i long for the morrow and the alls well a presentiment of evil weighs me down i have a raging nervous headache i have just bidden them both goodbye and given bryan my pistol this continued anxiety is killing me sunday morning may 11 i was aroused at a little after five by the report of a rifle and a cry enough to startle the dead harry stewart had been shot by the guard whom he had bribed being disappointed in the attempt at night bryan had given it up but poor impetuous confiding harry stewart was induced by the guard when he came on again at five to renew the attempt dr cox and the other yankee officers confined in the room above heard the plot between the guards to murder him the man who was in his pay saying to the other when he gets fairly out of the window i will cry halt and fire at the same time you hold your fire until he is down and then give it to him the agreement by stewart had been to give the man fifty dollars after he got down the supposition was that they thought to rob him as they carried him round to the prison entrance his friends however defeated this by drawing him up into his room his leg was dreadfully shattered making * necessary but he was so much prostrated by loss of blood previous to the operation that he could not rally from the effects of the chloroform but died between three and four oclock on the evening of the 12th an examination took place in the prison * for the purpose of establishing the fact of the * and dr cox and the other yankee officers made the statement above and it is inexplicable why the victim had not been warned by them of the murderous plot my own evidence was taken having been * of the whole affair and hearing the agreement with the guard i was asked if i would aid a prisoner in an attempt c i answered yes i considered it a point of honour to render any aid in money or otherwise the woman calling herself morris certified that i had furnished the means through my sister mrs leonard for the escape c thereby causing the arrest and detention of my sister for several days she demanded to be brought before the secretary of war when the * watson informed her that the charge had been made against her by this woman at the same time he released her from custody i saw my sister but once afterwards when she left the city as no longer a safe place for her my child is so nervous from a repetition of these dreadful scenes that she starts and cries out in her sleep horrors like this will shatter the nerves of the strongest 13th the murderer has been released from custody promoted to a corporal and put again on duty on this post i sent for the officer of the guard and remonstrated against it as an outrage and insult to every prisoner and that if allowed to remain he would probably be killed before the day was over he was in consequence sent away may 14 the sky of our destiny is brightening the successes of the gallant ashby and jackson have inspired the yankees with wholesome dread and they again apprehend a descent on washington but they watch me more closely in consequence when will this end i am nearly starved i had a fowl served up to me today or rather a small piece of one which must have been the cock which crowed thrice to wake peter we could not get our teeth through it rose cried heartily for she was very hungry captain bryan and the other gentlemen below have just smuggled me a supper i should starve but for the considerate kindness of these gentlemen may 15 last night the wildest panic prevailed the long roll was beat the guard doubled round the prison and the rumbling of artillery and tramp of men yelling and cursing as they marched kept us all on the qui vive yet even amidst our wild hopes mingled dread for we believed that our brutal guard would endeavour to wreak their vengeance upon us in the event of an attempt at rescue threats to that effect had often been vaguely uttered the panic was caused by a number of mules breaking their coral and coming across the long bridge the clatter of their hoofs alarmed the pickets who fled in great terror communicating the panic in their route that jackson ashby and stuart were in hot pursuit with a mighty army oh that it had been true that our hosts could sweep over their lands and leave behind the desolating * of war for as yet this people have known none of its horrors but made mighty profit thereby their manufacturing interests are revived with renewed energy in the furnishing of implements of war clothing and other supplies for their vast armies in the field whilst mr chase complacently * greenbacks chuckling over the issue of each additional million as a step nearer to national bankruptcy and the absolute despotism which is to rise out of the ruin of the old system heaven speed them in their work and may no ray of common sense stay their onward march how farcical now seem the boasted government of our fathers the declaration of independence and the constitution of the united states almost as much so as the constitution of the kingdom of * and which the first rude shock has scattered to the winds that profound and thinking men should now believe in the * of a system based upon such feeble security as the integrity of the governing power is still the wonder i can only hope that the experience of the past will guide our own people in the formation of a government which will be eternal with no element of disruption in it may 17 we are all in good spirits accounts are received daily of skirmishes in which our people are always successful the yankees are in continual dread of jacksons advance on washington may 18 a senatorial committee have just visited the prison i cannot understand precisely the object of it although certainly not meant for the benefit of the prisoners wood is very uneasy wilson of massachusetts was brought by him to see me and in the course of conversation told me that i was up to that period the most important prisoner taken that he had nevertheless advised my being immediately sent south but that seward mclellan and the rest thought differently that i would soon however be set free as the rebellion would be crushed out in a little while as richmond had already fallen i told him that if richmond fell it would bury the abolitionists under its ruins and rise from its ashes the capital of a mighty empire i do not venture to repeat the whole of my conversation with this abolition leader for all the bitterness and contempt which i felt for his race was thrown into it in the course of the interview i had the satisfaction of seeing the jealousy and division amongst themselves which i welcomed with joy as the * of the bitter retribution in the shape of civil war at the north which is to terminate the national existence of that corrupt and * people the progress of events is slow but sure for they now groan under the yoke of absolute despotism although all outspoken expression of discontent is suppressed the leaders are however aware of its existence and hope to avert the catastrophe by a vigorous invasion of the south and the employment of all the evil passions of their race in that unholy crusade may 19 there is again a talk of removing me to another prison since the murder of harry stewart all my friends are interdicted from visiting me and as i will not associate with the women prisoners i am in absolute solitude the hope of being released has quite unsettled my prison routine and i find it very difficult to fix my mind on any thing but the unutterable weariness of my lot when will it end i shrink with terror from the contemplation of the indefinite future and try to fix my mind upon the heroic deeds of my countrymen for in them indeed is my trust my only hope may 21 mr wood came to me just now and told me if i would write him a note asking him to recover my papers that he thought he could get them i question it very much nevertheless i will do it so i addressed him the following note to this demand i received the following reply to this i answered mr wood in order to make the above intelligible i must state that this man was an infidel that he derided christianity and exercised his astute reasoning powers in the analysis of those mysteries which our dull materialism was not destined to fathom as proofs of the absurdity of a faith founded upon theories and traditions so wild and vague as to be rejected when submitted to the test of reason he also rejected the evidence of the bible in support of christianity and denied its sacred character his textbook was the writings of * and if anyone asked him for a book to read he was sure either to give them as a great favour a * volume of his own writings collected in the form of a * with the ideas of * intensified or * or else as a special mark of grace the works of that infidel for apart from other peculiarities patent to every prisoner his desire to make * to his own want of faith was the ruling passion of his soul be was vindictive cunning and ambitious repelled with warmth any claim to being considered a gentleman and yet strange to say was by no means devoid of some generous * for i have known him to perform acts of great magnanimity and generosity stanton was his patron to whom he seemed bound by strong ties so it will be readily seen that he neither feared god nor man and that william p wood abraham lincoln and the emperor of russia were the most irresponsible absolute * on earth 23rd my existence is now a positive blank day glides into day with nothing to mark the flight of time and hope paints no silver lining to the clouds which hang over me wood * me each day with expectation of something which never happens in a fit of vexation i ordered him not to address himself to me save in his official capacity i almost wish i had not done it for the chattering of a monkey would even break pleasantly on the monotony of my life may 25 today as i walked in the prison yard a prisoner captured at front royal virginia threw at my feet a small piece of paper containing intelligence which made my heart leap with joy i eagerly devoured its contents which were that a battle had been fought on the 23rd and 24th at front royal in which we had gained a great victory having driven the yankees from the town and taken # prisoners besides a large quantity of stores which we very much needed all honour to the brave jackson who is now the special terror of the yankees 26th great excitement prevails here the abolitionists are again sending off their families last night i put my candle on the window in order to get something out of my trunk near which it stood all unconscious of committing any offence against prison discipline when the guard below called out put out that light i gave no heed and only lighted another whereupon several voices took up the cry adding dn you i will fire into your room rose was in a state of great delight and collected all the ends of candle to add to the illumination by this the clank of arms and clatter of feet in conjunction with a furious rap at my door and demand to open it announced the advent of corporals and * my door was now secured inside by a bolt which had been allowed me i asked their business answer you are making signals and must remove your lights from the window i said but it suits my convenience to keep them there we will break open your door if you dont open it you will act as you see fit but it will be at your peril they did not dare to carry out their threat as they knew that i had a very admirable pistol on my mantelpiece restored to me a short time since although they did not know that i had no ammunition for it the guard meanwhile were doubled around the prison on every post and the alls well cried throughout the night i subsequently explained to the officer of the guard the absurdity of the whole proceeding which he had the good sense to admit an order however came from the provostmarshal to capture my pistol which was accordingly done with reluctance by lieutenant miller i relate this as one of the absurd events which were constantly occurring sometimes in a far more offensive form 27th oh how weary i am i have not had even the newspapers for several days an odd volume of * * has helped me to * the heavy hours but the * of my own fate with that of other victims of tyranny does not diminish my sense of suffering the heat is intense with the sun beating down upon the housetop and in the windows the * terrible and hunger gnawing at ones vitals for alas i cannot eat the food set before me my child is looking pale and ill he who * here leaves hope behind is written in letters of blood over the * of lincolns prison but even in this bitter cup there is a sweet drop of consolation it is that the gulf is widening between the two races each victim * by the tyrant but makes the barrier more impassable that thought sustains me in the dread ordeal 28th the yankee papers this morning are certainly trying to cover a defeat under extravagant * mr stanton is again exhibiting his skill in his peculiar line in aid of mr * * * have just had a telegram from below that a battle has been fought at winchester where the yankees were defeated with great loss by stonewall jackson this news was brought in by some prisoners just arrived also that our great and good president is in perfect health the yankees having reported him in a critical state the wish was father to the thought may angels guard him for his countrys sake 29th alarm here on the increase jackson supposed to be en route for washington yankee sentinels very humble and conciliatory banks states that his defeat was caused by the war department taking away 10000 men to reinforce mclellan c 30th a long dull day with * rumours of my being sent to fort warren wood says i am certainly to be sent away and advises me to hold myself in readiness alas my faith in yankee human nature is long since gone saturday may 31 at two oclock today wood came in with the announcement that i was to start at three oclock for baltimore it being impossible to be ready at that hour the time was extended to five oclock there was a terrible scene between wood and the woman baxley last night she raved and screamed throughout the night i could not sleep so have a dreadful nervous headache with which to begin my journey i do not pretend to understand the merits of the case in justice i must state how very kind captain higgins lieutenant miller and mr wood have been today captain higgins carried me throughout the prison to say goodbye to my companions in captivity i exhorted them all to bear up bravely under their misfortune not that they needed it for all burned to be free to share in the glorious struggle now going on god grant that they were for many a stout arm would strike a blow for freedom after taking leave of these kind friends captain higgins introduced lieutenant who was by order of the war department to be the chief of my escort he had six men detailed to accompany him making quite a military display dressed in full uniform with sword and carbine in hand outside of the prison the whole guard were drawn up under arms besides a mounted guard of twelve men also with swords and carbines before entering the carriage i turned to the officer and said sir ere i advance further i ask you not as lincolns officer but as a man of honour and a gentleman are your orders from baltimore to conduct me to a northern prison or to some point in the confederacy he replied with politeness and promptness on my honour madam to conduct you to fortress monroe and thence to the southern confederacy in proof of which i show you my order for transportation c satisfied on this head i entered the carriage the woman baxley and the one calling herself mrs morris mason c were sent at the same time the superintendent who accompanied and the officer and guard as also the mounted escort followed the carriage with carbines and drawn swords to the dept arrived there a large force was in attendance to prevent communication with * friends these precautions however failed for many a word was stealthily whispered and many a hearty god bless you spoken a separate car was taken for the prisoners and guard arriving at baltimore the car in which i was was kept back until all the passengers had left the dept a strong military guard being here also in attendance i was put into a carriage with my child the other prisoners in another and was driven with the officer inside of the carriage with me and the guard on the box to the gilmer house the officer and guard jealously watching to prevent communication apartments being prepared i was taken to mine sentinels were stationed at the different doors to prevent communication all intercourse being prohibited my name had been put in the register the detective baker by order of general dix had it * as they did not wish it known that i was in that rebel city general dix being telegraphed to go to washington left early on sunday morning consequently mr wood took upon himself to relax the rigorous interdict and allowed me to see some kind and * friends and my soul expanded once more under the genial influences of a kindred race at five oclock on the afternoon of sunday june 1 the officer of the guard announced that all was in readiness to depart for the boat which had been detained for the purpose of conveying me to fortress monroe a large number of persons had by this assembled to offer congratulations the good news had reached our friends that a battle had been fought and that skirmishing was still going on at seven pines near richmond in which we had defeated the yankees with heavy loss this of course was the brightest * that could have greeted me the goodbye was spoken and many friends followed to the boat upon reaching it a guard was stationed around who with bayonet in hand repulsed every attempt of any but the prisoners to go on board such being the orders general dix and suite being expected the boat was detained for them several hours during all that time an eager crowd surrounded the approaches to the wharf and regardless of the angry and rude repulse of the military continued to assemble so far as the eye could reach handkerchiefs were waving and the tearful eye and hearty god bless you which responded from all sides regardless of the bayonets of the tyrant told that the hearts of the people of maryland however * and downtrodden beat in unison with their brethren of the south general dix arriving about eight oclock the signal was given to weigh anchor and i was fairly en route for the capital of the confederacy general dix after a few moments came to pay his respects to me and in very kind terms expressed his congratulations c i was deeply chagrined at the rude conduct of the two women towards general dix and rebuked it by my manner as well as i could the boat reached the wharf at fortress monroe at an early hour on the morning of june 2 general dix and suite went ashore here for the purpose of relieving general wool who had made himself so obnoxious to the people of norfolk and its vicinity on account of his harshness and cruelty that the abolition government deemed it politic to replace him by one whose kind and conciliatory conduct had been deeply appreciated by the people of baltimore i regretted the exchange for i did not wish the bitter * of national degradation to be * the fiercer the rule the more certain the retribution to follow no orders had been given to provide refreshments but the captain of the boat who was a most gentlemanly person prepared at his own cost a most ample luncheon together with some iced champagne and i had the pleasure of proposing the health of president davis and the success of the confederate cause under the bristling guns of the enemy and my toast drunk by all present several visitors having been added to the number on board the officer of the guard behaved very well and discreetly got out of hearing meanwhile an aidedecamp of general wool accompanied by the provostmarshal colonel jones came on board to make arrangements for forwarding me on my journey colonel jones asked me where i wished to go i replied to the capital of the confederacy wherever that might be he told me that it was still richmond asserting that that city had not fallen as had been published at the north but that it would be in their hands before i got there i said i would take the chances and only asked that no time might be lost colonel gay fell into conversation with me and i gleaned some very interesting facts from him he was in a short time summoned away and i was told put under arrest for having been too communicative about four oclock in the afternoon i was called upon to be in readiness to go on board of the boat which had been chartered to take me to city point and marched through the * sun to the place where she lay some time after the boat got under way but made no great progress night coming on and the river the james river being difficult of navigation the * having all been taken up by our people the captain was afraid of running aground so lay to until daylight on the morning of the 3rd about seven oclock we came in sight of the glorious achievements of the virginia the wreck of the congress and other vessels destroyed by her the monitor lay down the stream at a short distance and i had a good view of the low black ugly thing at this point the captain again anchored and an officer went off in a small boat to get instructions from the commander of the monitor for landing me after an absence which seemed endless a * boat put off from her in which i with the other prisoners embarked and were taken alongside of the monitor an officer from that boat coming on board in command of the party to city point i was under intense excitement for after nearly ten weary months of imprisonment i was in sight of the promised land in a short time we reached the shore and my foot pressed the sacred soil i had worn on my shoulders from fortress monroe in the folds of a shawl a large battleflag which had been made by myself and other prisoners whilst in prison for general beauregard i felt strongly tempted to * it and cast it to the breeze as a parting defiance to the yankees but i remembered that the same means might be useful again i was received by colonel ash and other confederate officers whose bold and soldierly bearing contrasted most strikingly with the vandal race whom i had seen i hope for the last time i was conducted under escort of those gentlemen to petersburg where i was received with every demonstration of kindness and respect general ransom the commander of the department came to call upon me and took charge of the arrangements for my departure to richmond and sent colonel ash to escort me i arrived in richmond on the morning of the 4th and was taken to the best hotel in the place the ballard house where rooms had been prepared for me general winder the commandant of richmond came immediately to call upon me so as to dispense with the usual formality of my reporting to him on the evening after my arrival our president did me the honour to call upon me and his words of greeting but for you there would have been no battle of bull run repaid me for all that i had endured even though it had been magnified * and i shall ever remember that as the proudest moment of my whole life to have received the tribute of praise from him who stands as the apostle of our countrys liberty in the eyes of the civilised world it would swell these pages far beyond my prescribed limits if i were to enter upon a description of the exciting scenes which met my eye on my arrival at richmond all was warlike preparation and stern defiance and resistance to the invader the result of the battles before richmond is well known and exhibits to the world the capabilities of a people in the defence of their rights the proud triumphant foe with every advantage of numbers c in his favour who flaunted his banner before our capital threatening us with annihilation was defeated and driven for shelter behind his gunboats the scene of their insolent triumph was changed into a * with the very air rank and pestiferous with the * from their * bodies where they lay as a warning monument to tyrants for all future time this is a fruitful theme for abler pens than mine my intention is in the succeeding chapter to touch upon the causes which have effected the disruption of the federal compact between north and south as an exemplification of the evil consequences which flow from usurpation in this my concluding chapter i shall touch upon a subject which properly does not come within my text and i approach it with a gravity commensurate with its importance it is not my purpose to elucidate the causes which have brought about the * of the american republic i do not pretend to the character of a * or that of a philosophical historian but as an attentive and i trust impartial observer i think i can correct some grave * of the events which have gained credence in the first place slavery although the occasion was not the producing cause of the dissolution the cord which bound the sections together was strained beyond its strength and of course snapped at the point where the fretting of the strands was greatest the contest on the part of the north was for supreme control especially in relation to the fiscal action of the government this object could not be fully attained by a mere numerical majority a majority of states was also necessary to secure this majority and thus complete the political ascendency the north the policy of no more slave states was formally set forth a political party was formed whose sole principle was the exclusion of slavery from the territories there was no moral sentiment involved in this it did not alter the status of slavery it made not a human being free nor did it propose to do so sir said mr webster in the senate this is not a moral question it is a question of political power lord russell has more recently corroborated this bold assertion by saying that this was a struggle on one side for supremacy and on the other for independence on the other hand the southern states struggling for equality and seeking to maintain the equilibrium of the government insisted upon the rights of their citizens to enter and live in the new territories upon terms of equality with the men north of mason and dixons line they contended for the right of extending their social institutions not to * slavery not to make a single human being a slave that would otherwise be free but simply to preserve the equilibrium of power between the two sections it is true that the antislavery fanaticism was brought to bear and it is also true that there followed a * agitation which divided churches rent asunder political parties diminished and embittered the intercourse of society and unfitted congress for the performance of its constitutional duties and resulted in the estrangement of the southern people from their northern connection but this estrangement was not an active or stimulating motive and manifested itself rather in the want of any general anxiety to restrain the movement for disunion equally unfounded is the allegation that the secession of the south originated in the exasperation of a defeated party and hostility to the successful candidate the personal character of mr lincoln and his political opinions except so far as they represented that armed doctrine which menaced the equality of the southern states and was contrived for their oppression and degradation had not formed with the southern people the subject of either interest or enquiry they knew that there were in the constitution important checks which would furnish them with ample means of protecting themselves against the hostile purposes of the existing incumbent and even of repairing such violations of the fundamental law as might during his term of service be beyond their control the stern protest of the southern people free from all party violence and recklessness indicated a thorough knowledge of the extent and depth of the grievances inflicted upon them and subsequent events have proved that they had both wisdom and heroism adequate to evolve the proper remedy and firmly to apply it they regarded it as the first step towards the overthrow of american representative liberty even considering the northern theory of government to be true viz that the union was one consolidated republic it is essential that the central authority derive its powers and draw its force from all the parts of the entire nation so that by their * independence they can counteract the tendency of any one part to usurp the sovereignty of the whole when the north assumed the government over the south as its own exclusive possession it sought to establish an unmitigated tyranny for liberty true civil liberty cannot exist where rights are on one side of a geographical line and the power on the other the southern people are * * tenacious in their * and opposed even to a fault to * but where the alternative was presented of an overthrow of their political liberty or a change in their federal relations they did not hesitate to prove that they were fully justified i will cite the testimony of expresident fillmore a northern statesman never charged with southern or * sympathies after * with great earnestness against a course so monstrous he adds these are serious but practical questions and in order to appreciate them fully it is only necessary to turn the tables upon ourselves suppose that the south having a majority of the electoral votes should declare that they would only have * for presidents and should elect such by their exclusive * to rule over us at the north do you think that we would submit to it cries of no never no not for a moment and do you believe that our southern brethren are less sensitive upon this subject than you or less jealous of their rights if you do let me tell you that you are mistaken and therefore you must see that if this sectional party succeeds it leads inevitably to the destruction of this beautiful fabric reared by our forefathers consolidated by their blood and bequeathed to us as a priceless blessing i call especial attention to the following views not only on account of their * value but from the notoriety which * to the author as the interested advocate of the lincoln government i doubt if the annals of revolution furnish a more flagrant instance of political * but i will appeal from philip drunk to philip sober the following is a portion of the letter by the hon r j walker entitled an appeal for the union setting forth the enormity of the pretensions of the abolition party and the consequences certain to succeed their assumption of the control of the government as my object is to give a simple record of events i do not propose to attempt the vindication of the institution which has been the fruitful theme of reproach and denunciation amongst the opponents of southern independence the english writers who discuss this subject seem to confine themselves to the consideration of the abstract principle of slavery and entirely overlook the facts and circumstances of the case few institutions of government or society could stand such a test if the question were simply whether it would not be better for the south to have four millions of intelligent industrious and valiant freemen in the place of four millions of african slaves it would be neither so delicate nor difficult of solution but the question which taxes the practical statesmanship and philanthropy of the southern people is of a far graver character it is this two races one civilised the other barbarous being * * what does the good of society require the freedom or servitude of the barbarous race the south believe that the freedom of the blacks under such circumstances would result certainly in their final extermination and that servitude is best adapted to their intellectual and moral condition the antagonism of race is as fixed and * as any other law of nature and has been exemplified in the history of the world wherever the opposing elements have come in conflict the north american indians were a race of warriors with far higher intellectual capabilities than the negro and not * that unutterable prejudice against * which exists against the negro but at the same time there being no motive of interest in the superior race to protect them they have been driven from their * which at no distant period embraced half of the north american continent to a few acres on the confines of civilisation which they inhabit by the * of the dominant race in support of the usages of civilisation in favour of this law of race i can cite an example which comes within my own immediate knowledge and which is * by the fanaticism and * which attach to the negro question in california there are between sixty and seventy thousand chinese being about * of the whole population they are a civilised industrious and most useful people yet they cannot be * cannot bear witness in court cannot * with the white race or exercise a single right of citizenship except pay taxes the wisdom of the policy of the south in regard to this inherited responsibility is abundantly vindicated by the very aspect which the institution of slavery now presents to the world for thirty years its enemies have * assailed it by every agency of mind and heart the pulpit the press hostile legislation secret societies armed robbers have all been employed to excite discontent and insurrection in the southern states their * have split the aspiring structure of the american government from * to * they have caused the most bloody and implacable war known to modern history and yet the institution of slavery survives it all firm and unimpaired nowhere on earth not even in happy england rejoicing in peace does there exist between the various classes of society such harmony such sympathy as the south exhibits in the midst of her trials surely the condition of such a social commonwealth must rest upon the solid foundation which supports all civil institutions the good of the whole state but we are asked do not your statutes withhold any legal enforcement to the marriage relations amongst slaves i beg my readers to have this objection properly stated it should be borne in mind that we have not taken from them any rights which they had ever recognised or conferred among themselves the race as we found it was destitute of any such institution or even the knowledge of it nevertheless it is true that our laws are justly chargeable with the reproach of not having secured to them this blessing of civilisation but what the law has failed to do religion and usage have effected the institution of marriage does exist among slaves and is encouraged and
