* s c november 8 #* on the train just before we reached fernandina a woman called out that * the * tanny touched me on the shoulder and said lincolns elected how do you know the man over there has a telegram the excitement was very great everybody was talking at the same time one a little more moved than the others stood up and said * the die is cast no more vain regrets sad forebodings are useless the stake is life or death did you ever was the prevailing exclamation and some one cried out now that the black radical republicans have the power i suppose they will brown us all no doubt of it i have always kept a journal after a fashion of my own with dates and a line of poetry or prose mere quotations which i understood and no one else and i have kept letters and extracts from the papers from today forward i will tell the story in my own way i now wish i had a chronicle of the two delightful and eventful years that have just passed those delights have fled and ones breath is taken away to think what events have since crowded in like the womans record in her journal we have had * as * shocks at fernandina i saw young men running up a palmetto flag and shouting a little prematurely south carolina has seceded i was * to find florida so sympathetic but tanny told me the young men were * * and * names as inevitably south carolinian as moses and lazarus are jewish from my window i can hear a grand and mighty flow of eloquence bartow and a delegation from savannah are having a supper given to them in the diningroom below the noise of the speaking and cheering is pretty hard on a tired traveler suddenly i found myself listening with pleasure voice tone temper sentiment language all were perfect i sent tanny to see who it was that spoke he came back saying mr alfred huger the old postmaster he may not have been the wisest or * man there but he certainly made the best * speech we have been up to the mulberry plantation with colonel * and judge * who were sent to columbia by their fellowcitizens in the low country to hasten the slow movement of the wisdom assembled in the state capital their message was they said go ahead dissolve the union and be done with it or it will be worse for you the fire in the rear is hottest and yet people talk of the politicians leading everywhere that i have been people have been complaining bitterly of slow and * public leaders judge * is a local celebrity who has been stretched across the street in * showing him tearing off his robes of office the painting is in vivid colors the canvas huge and the rope hardly discernible he is depicted with a countenance flaming with contending * disgust and disdain we agreed that the time had now come we had talked so much heretofore let the * have it out massachusetts and south carolina are always coming up before the footlights as a woman of course it is easy for me to be brave under the skins of other people so i said fight it out * has brought on a fever that only * will cure my companions breathed fire and fury but i dare say they were amusing themselves with my dismay for talk as i would that i could not hide at kingsville we encountered james chesnut fresh from columbia where he had resigned his seat in the united states senate the day before said some one * mrs chesnut does not look at all resigned for once in her life mrs chesnut held her tongue she was dumb in the * style which of late seems to have gotten into the very air she was offering up her life to the cause we have had a brief pause the men who are all like pickens insensible to fear are very sensible in case of smallpox there being now an epidemic of smallpox in columbia they have adjourned to charleston in camden we were busy and frantic with excitement drilling marching arming and wearing high blue * red sashes guns and swords were ordinary fireside accompaniments so wild were we i saw at a grand parade of the * a woman the wife of a man who says he is a secessionist per se driving about to see the drilling of this new company although her father was buried the day before edward j * writes me from san francisco on november 30th i see that mr chesnut has resigned and that south carolina is hastening into a convention perhaps to secession mr chesnut is probably to be president of the convention i see all of the leaders in the state are in favor of secession but i confess i hope the black republicans will take the alarm and submit some treaty of peace that will enable us now and forever to settle the question and save our generation from the prostration of business and the decay of prosperity that must come both to the north and south from a disruption of the union however i wont speculate before this reaches you south carolina may be off on her own * separate republic mrs charles lowndes was sitting with us today when mrs kirkland brought in a copy of the secession ordinance i wonder if my face grew as white as hers she said after a moment god help us as our day so shall our strength be how grateful we were for this pious ejaculation of hers they say i had better take my last look at this beautiful place * it is on the coast open to gunboats we mean business this time because of this * of the * this convention in it are all our wisest and best they really have tried to send the ablest men the good men and true south carolina was never more splendidly represented patriotism aside it makes society delightful one need not regret having left washington mrs * came in quietly from her * today and in her neat incisive manner exploded this bombshell major anderson has moved into fort sumter while governor pickens slept serenely the row is fast and furious now state after state is taking its forts and * they say if we had been left out in the cold alone we might have * a while but back we would have had to go and would merely have fretted and * and quarreled among ourselves we needed a little wholesome neglect anderson has blocked that game but now our sister states have joined us and we are strong i give the condensed * of the tabletalk anderson has united the cotton states now for virginia anderson has opened the ball those who want a row are in high glee those who dread it are glum and thoughtful enough a letter from susan rutledge captain * folded the united states army flag just before * ours was run up in its place you know the arsenal is in sight what is the next move i pray god to guide us we stand in need of wise counsel something more than courage the talk is fort sumter must be taken and it is one of the strongest forts how in the name of sense are they to manage i shudder to think of rash moves * ala february 19 #* * confederacy is making or * its constitution everybody wants mr davis to be generalinchief or president keitt and boyce and a party preferred howell cobb for president and the * per se wanted barnwell rhett my brother stephen brought the officers of the montgomery blues to dinner very soiled blues they said apologizing for their rough condition poor fellows they had been a month before fort pickens and not allowed to attack it they said colonel chase built it and so were sure it was impregnable colonel lomax telegraphed to governor moore if he might try to take it chase or no chase and got for his answer no and now say the blues we have worked like niggers and when the fun and fighting begin they send us home and put regulars there they have an immense amount of powder the wheel of the car in which it was carried took fire there was an escape for you we are packing a hamper of * for them i am despondent once more if i thought them in earnest because at first they put their best in front what now we have to meet tremendous odds by pluck activity zeal dash endurance of the * military instinct we have had to choose born leaders of men who could attract love and secure trust everywhere political intrigue is as rife as in washington * saying of sir walter raleigh that he could toil terribly was an electric touch above all let the men who are to save south carolina be young and vigorous while i was reflecting on what kind of men we ought to choose i fell on * and it was easy to construct my man out of his portraits what has been may be again so the men need not be purely ideal types mr toombs told us a story of general scott and himself he said he was dining in washington with scott who seasoned every dish and every glass of wine with the eternal refrain save the union the union must be preserved toombs remarked that he knew why the union was so dear to the general and illustrated his point by a steamboat anecdote an explosion of course while the passengers were struggling in the water a woman ran up and down the bank crying oh save the redheaded man the redheaded man was saved and his * after landing him noticed with surprise how little interest in him the woman who had made such moving appeals seemed to feel he asked her why did you make that pathetic outcry she answered oh he owes me ten thousand dollars now general said toombs the union owes you seventeen thousand dollars a year i can imagine the scorn on old scotts face find every one working very hard here as i dozed on the sofa last night could hear the scratch scratch of my husbands pen as he wrote at the table until midnight after church today captain ingraham called he left me so uncomfortable he dared to express regrets that he had to leave the united states navy he had been stationed in the mediterranean where he liked to be and expected to be these two years and to take those lovely daughters of his to florence then came abraham lincoln and rampant black republicanism and he must lay down his life for south carolina he however does not make any moan he says we lack everything necessary in naval * to * fort sumter of course he only expects the navy to take it he is a fish out of water here he is one of the finest * so i suppose they will soon give him a ship and send him back to his own element at dinner judge was loudly abusive of congress he said they have trampled the constitution * they have provided president davis with a house he was disgusted with the folly of parading the president at the inauguration in a coach drawn by four white horses then some one said mrs fitzpatrick was the only lady who sat with the congress after the inaugural she poked jeff davis in the back with her parasol that he might turn and speak to her i am sure that was democratic enough said some one governor moore came in with the latest * telegram from governor pickens to the president that a war steamer is lying off the charleston bar laden with reenforcements for fort sumter and what must we do answer use your own discretion there is faith for you after all is said and done it is believed there is still some discretion left in south carolina fit for use everybody who comes here wants an office and the many who of course are disappointed raise a cry of corruption against the few who are successful i thought we had left all that in washington nobody is willing to be out of sight and all will take office constitution browne says he is going to washington for twentyfour hours i mean to send by him to mary garnett for a bonnet ribbon if they take him up as a traitor he may cause a civil war war is now our dread mr chesnut told him not to make himself a bone of contention everybody means to go into the army if sumter is attacked then jeff daviss troubles will begin the judge says a military despotism would be best for * to prevent a triumph of the yankees all right but every man objects to any despot but himself mr chesnut in high spirits * today with the louisiana delegation breakfasted with constitution browne who is appointed assistant secretary of state and so does not go to washington there was at table the man who advertised for a wife with the wife so obtained she was not pretty we dine at mr * and go to a ball afterward at judge * the new york herald says lincoln stood before washingtons picture at his inauguration which was taken by the country as a good sign we are always frantic for a good sign let us pray that a csar or a napoleon may be sent us that would be our best sign of success but they still say no war peace let it be kind heaven dr de leon called fresh from washington and says general scott is using all his power and influence to prevent officers from the south resigning their commissions among other things promising that they shall never be sent against us in case of war captain ingraham in his short curt way said that will never do if they take their governments pay they must do its fighting a brilliant dinner at the * mr barnwell took me down came home and found the judge and governor moore waiting to go with me to the * and they say it is dull in montgomery clayton fresh from washington was at the party and told us there was to be peace in the drawingroom a literary lady began a violent attack upon this * south carolina she told me she was a successful writer in the magazines of the day but when i found she used incredible for incredulous i said not a word in defense of my native land i left her incredible another person came in while she was pouring upon me her home troubles and asked if she did not know i was a carolinian then she gracefully reversed her engine and took the other tack sounding our praise but i left her incredible and i remained incredulous too brewster says the war specks are growing in size nobody at the north or in virginia believes we are in earnest they think we are * and that jeff davis and stephens are getting up a very pretty little comedy the virginia delegates were insulted at the peace conference brewster said kicked out the judge thought jefferson davis rude to him when the latter was secretary of war mr chesnut persuaded the judge to forego his private wrong for the public good and so he voted for him but now his old grudge has come back with an increased * what a pity to bring the * of the old union into this new one it seems to me already men are willing to risk an injury to our cause if they may in so doing hurt jeff davis dined today with mr hill from georgia and his wife after he left us she told me he was the celebrated individual who for christian scruples refused to fight a duel with stephens she seemed very proud of him for his conduct in the affair * that i am i had not heard of it i am having all kinds of experiences drove today with a lady who fervently wished her husband would go down to pensacola and be shot i was dumb with amazement of course telling my story to one who knew the parties was informed dont you know he beats her so i have seen a man who lifts his hand against a woman in aught save kindness brewster says lincoln passed through baltimore disguised and at night and that he did well for just now baltimore is dangerous ground he says that he hears from all quarters that the vulgarity of lincoln his wife and his son is beyond credence a thing you must see before you can believe it senator stephen a douglas told mr chesnut that lincoln is awfully clever and that he had found him a heavy handful went to pay my respects to mrs jefferson davis she met me with open arms we did not allude to anything by which we are surrounded we * politics and our changed relations everybody in fine spirits in my world they have one and all spoken in the congress to their own perfect satisfaction to my amazement the judge took me aside and after delivering a panegyric upon himself but here later comes in the amazement he praised my husband to the skies and said he was the fittest man of all for a foreign mission aye and the farther away they send us from this congress the better i will like it saw * * and nick davis social curiosities they are * leaders then george sanders and george deas the georges are of opinion that it is folly to try to take back fort sumter from anderson and the united states that is before we are ready they saw in charleston the devoted band prepared for the sacrifice i mean ready to run their heads against a stone wall dare devils they are they have dash and courage enough but science only could take that fort they shook their heads the washington congress has passed peace measures glory be to god as my irish margaret used to preface every remark both great and small at last according to his wish i was able to introduce mr hill of georgia to mr mallory and also governor moore and brewster the latter the only man without a title of some sort that i know in this democratic * republic i have seen a negro woman sold on the block at auction she * the crowd i was walking and felt faint seasick the creature looked so like my good little * a bright mulatto with a pleasant face she was magnificently gotten up in silks and * she seemed delighted with it all sometimes * the * sometimes looking quiet * and modest but her mouth never relaxed from its expanded grin of excitement i dare say the poor thing knew who would buy her i sat down on a stool in a shop and disciplined my wild thoughts i tried it * fashion you know how women sell themselves and are sold in marriage from queens downward eh you know what the bible says about slavery and marriage poor women poor slaves * with his * did he know he only thought he did not feel in * * i read like a true english female she believed in her own inflexible virtue but never trusted her husband out of sight the new york herald says lincolns carriage is not bombproof so he does not drive out two flags and a bundle of sticks have been sent him as gentle * the sticks are to break our heads with the english are * unhappy as to our family quarrel magnanimous of them for it is their opportunity we stood on the balcony to see our confederate flag go up * of cannon etc etc miss sanders complained so said captain ingraham of the * of the mob it was utterly spiritless she said no cheering or so little and no enthusiasm captain ingraham suggested that gentlemen are apt to be quiet and this was a thoughtful crowd the true mob element with us just now is * corn and yet it is uncomfortable that the idea has gone abroad that we have no joy no pride in this thing the band was playing massa in the cold cold ground miss tyler daughter of the former president of the united states ran up the flag captain ingraham pulled out of his pocket some verses sent to him by a boston girl they were well * and amounted to this she held a rope ready to hang him though she shed tears when she remembered his heroic rescue of * * the rebel she calls us rebels too so it depends upon whom one rebels * to save or not shall be heroic i must read lincolns inaugural oh comes he in peace or comes he in war or to tread but one measure as young * lincolns aim is to * the border states the people the natives i mean are astounded that i calmly affirm in all truth and candor that if there were awful things in society in washington i did not see or hear of them one must have been hard to please who did not like the people i knew in washington mr chesnut has gone with a list of names to the * * kershaw baker and robert rutledge they are taking a walk i see i hope there will be good places in the army for our list judge campbell of the united states supreme court has resigned lord how he must have hated to do it how other men who are resigning high positions must hate to do it now we may be sure the bridge is broken and yet in the alabama convention they say * abound and are busy met a distinguished gentleman that i knew when he was in more affluent circumstances i was willing enough to speak to him but when he saw me advancing for that purpose to avoid me he suddenly dodged around a * mrs de * former coachman i remember him on his box driving a handsome pair of bays dressed * in blue broadcloth and brass buttons a stout respectable finelooking middleaged mulatto he was very high and mighty night after night we used to meet him as * of all our parties he sat in solemn dignity making faces over his bow and patting his foot with an emphasis that shook the floor we gave him five dollars a night that was his price his mistress never refused to let him play for any party he had * in abundance he was far above any physical fear for his sleek and wellfed person how majestically he scraped his foot as a sign that he was * up and ready to begin now he is a shabby creature indeed he must have felt his fallen fortunes when he met * who knew him in his prosperity he ran away this stately yellow gentleman from wife and children home and comfort my molly asked him why miss * was good to you i know i wonder who owns him now he looked forlorn governor moore brought in to be presented to me the president of the alabama convention it seems i had known him before he had danced with me at a * ball when i was in short frocks with sash flounces and a wreath of roses he was one of those clever boys of our neighborhood in whom my father saw promise of better things and so helped him in every way to rise with books counsel sympathy i was enjoying his conversation immensely for he was praising my father without stint when the judge came in breathing fire and fury congress has incurred his displeasure we are abusing one another as fiercely as ever we have abused yankees it is * mrs childs was here tonight mary anderson from * with several children she is lovely her hair is piled up on the top of her head * fashions from france still creep into texas across mexican borders mrs childs is fresh from texas her husband is an artillery officer or was they will be glad to promote him here mrs childs had the sweetest southern voice absolute music but then she has all of the high spirit of those * carolina women too then mr browne came in with his fine english accent so pleasant to the ear he tells us that washington society is not reconciled to the yankee rgime mrs lincoln means to economize she at once informed the * that they were poor and hoped to save twelve thousand dollars every year from their salary of twenty thousand mr browne said mr buchanans farewell was far more imposing than lincolns inauguration the people were so amusing so full of western stories dr boykin behaved strangely all day he had been gaily driving about with us and never was man in finer spirits tonight in this brilliant company he sat dead still as if in a * once he waked * a high public functionary came in with a present for me a miniature * a perfect venetian specimen he assured me again and again in an undertone dr boykin muttered that fellow has been drinking why do you think so because he has told you exactly the same thing four times wonderful some of these great statesmen always tell me the same thingand have been telling me the same thing ever since we came here a man came in and some one said in an undertone the age of chivalry is not past o ye americans what do you mean that man was once nominated by president buchanan for a foreign mission but some senator stood up and read a paper printed by this man abusive of a woman and signed by his name in full after that the senate would have none of him his chance was gone forever in full conclave tonight the drawingroom crowded with judges governors senators generals congressmen they were * john c calhouns hospitality he allowed everybody to stay all night who chose to stop at his house an illmannered person on one occasion refused to attend family prayers mr calhoun said to the servant saddle that mans horse and let him go from the traveler calhoun would take no excuse for the deity offended i believe in mr calhouns hospitality but not in his family prayers mr calhouns piety was of the most philosophical type from all accounts the latest news is counted good news that is the last man who left washington tells us that seward is in the ascendency he is thought to be the friend of peace the man did say however that that serpent seward is in the ascendency just now harriet lane has eleven * one is described as likely to win or he would be likely to win except that he is too heavily * he has been married before and goes about with children and two mothers there are limits beyond which two * mr * spoke to mrs lincoln in behalf of a doorkeeper who almost felt he had a vested right having been there since jacksons time but met with the same answer she had brought her own girl and must economize mr * thought the twenty thousand and little enough it is was given to the president of these united states to enable him to live in proper style and to maintain an establishment of such dignity as * the head of a great nation it is an infamy to economize with the public money and to put it into ones private purse mrs browne was walking with me when we were * our indignation against mrs lincoln and her shabby economy the herald says three only of the lite washington families attended the inauguration ball the judge has just come in and said last night after dr boykin left on the cars there came a telegram that his little daughter amanda had died suddenly in some way he must have known it beforehand he changed so suddenly yesterday and seemed so careworn and unhappy he believes in * magnetism and all that certainly there was some terrible foreboding of this kind on his part * this they say is positive fort sumter is to be released and we are to have no war after all far too good to be true mr browne told us that at one of the peace intervals i mean intervals in the interest of peace lincoln flew through baltimore locked up in an express car he wore a scotch cap we went to the congress governor cobb who * over that august body put james chesnut in the chair and came down to talk to us he told us why the pay of congressmen was fixed in secret session and why the amount of it was never * prevent the * and hotel people from making their bills of a size to cover it all the bill would be sure to correspond with the pay he said in the hotel parlor we had a scene mrs scott was describing lincoln who is of the cleverest yankee type she said awfully ugly even grotesque in appearance the kind who are always at the corner stores sitting on boxes * sticks and telling stories as funny as they are vulgar here i interposed but stephen a douglas said one day to mr chesnut lincoln is the hardest fellow to handle i have ever encountered yet mr scott is from california and said lincoln is an utter american specimen coarse rough and strong a goodnatured kind creature as * as he is clever and if this country can be joked and laughed out of its rights he is the kindhearted fellow to do it now if there is a war and it * the yankee pocket instead of filling it here a shrill voice came from the next room which opened upon the one we were in by folding doors thrown wide open and said yankees are no more mean and * than you are people at the north are just as good as people at the south the speaker advanced upon us in great wrath mrs scott apologized and made some smooth polite remark though evidently much embarrassed but the * face and curly pate refused to receive any concessions and replied that comes with a very bad grace after what you were saying and she * us loudly for several minutes some one in the other room giggled outright but we were quiet as mice nobody wanted to hurt her feelings she was one against so many if i were at the north i should expect them to * us and should hold my tongue we separated north from south because of incompatibility of temper we are * because we have hated each other so if we could only separate a separation * as the french say it and not have a horrid fight for divorce the poor exile had already been insulted she said she was playing yankee doodle on the piano before breakfast to soothe her wounded spirit and the judge came in and calmly requested her to leave out the yankee while she played the doodle the yankee end of it did not suit our climate he said was totally out of place and had got out of its latitude a man said aloud this war talk is nothing it will soon blow over only a fuss gotten up by that charleston clique mr toombs asked him to show his passports for a man who uses such language is a suspicious character * s c march 26 #* have just come from mulberry where the snow was a foot * at last after months of apparently may or june weather even the climate like everything else is upside down but after that den of dirt and horror montgomery hall how white the sheets looked luxurious bed linen once more delicious fresh cream with my coffee i breakfasted in bed * was rife in camden william m shannon challenged * * blair was * second and * goodwyn was * my husband was riding hard all day to stop the foolish people mr chesnut finally arranged the difficulty there was a court of honor and no duel mr * had struck mr shannon at a negro trial thats the way the row began everybody knows of it we suggested that judge withers should arrest the belligerents dr boykin and joe kershaw aided mr chesnut to put an end to the useless risk of life john chesnut is a pretty * * he had two negroes arrested for selling whisky to his people on his plantation and buying stolen corn from them the culprits in jail sent for him he found them this snowy weather lying in the cold on a bare floor and he thought that punishment enough they having had weeks of it but they were not satisfied to be allowed to evade justice and slip away they begged of him and got five dollars to buy shoes to run away in i said why this is flat * a * and johnny put his hands in the * of his * and stalked majestically before me saying woman what do you know about law mrs reynolds stopped the carriage one day to tell me * boykin was to be married to savage heyward he has only ten children already these people take the old hebrew pride in the number of children they have this is the true * spirit there is no danger of crowding here and inhabitants are wanted old colonel chesnut said one day wife you must feel that you have not been useless in your day and generation you have now twentyseven * * have been * by my own house servants some of them are at the plantation some hired out at the camden hotel some are at mulberry they agreed to come in a body and beg me to stay at home to keep my own house once more as i ought not to have them scattered and distributed every which way i had not been a month in camden since 1858 so a house there would be for their benefit solely not mine i asked my cook if she lacked anything on the plantation at the hermitage lack anything she said i lack everything what are cornmeal bacon milk and molasses would that be all you wanted aint i been living and eating exactly as you does all these years when i cook for you didnt i have some of all * now then she doubled herself up laughing they all shouted missis we is crazy for you to stay home * my butler said he hated the hotel besides he heard a man there abusing marster but mr * took it up and made him stop short * said he wanted marster to know mr * was his friend and would let nobody say a word behind his back against him etc etc stay in camden not if i can help it * in provincial * tennysons way of putting it we came down here by rail as the english say such a crowd of convention men on board john manning flew in to beg me to reserve a seat by me for a young lady under his charge place aux dames said my husband politely and went off to seek a seat somewhere else as soon as we were fairly under way governor manning came back and threw himself cheerily down into the vacant place after arranging his umbrella and overcoat to his satisfaction he coolly remarked i am the young lady he is always the handsomest man alive now that poor william * has been killed in a duel and he can be very agreeable that is when he pleases to be so he does not always please he seemed to have made his little maneuver principally to warn me of impending danger to my husbands political career every election now will be a surprise new cliques are not formed yet the old ones are principally bent upon * one another but the * dreadful yankees oh never mind we are going to take care of home folks first how will you like to * back and mind your own business if i only knew what that * was my own business our round table consists of the judge langdon cheves trescott and ourselves here are four of the cleverest men that we have but such very different people as opposite in every characteristic as the four points of the compass langdon cheves and my husband have feelings and ideas in common mr petigru said of the brilliant trescott he is a man without indignation trescott and i laugh at everything the judge from his life as * and then on the bench has learned to look for the darkest motives for every action his judgment on men and things is always so harsh it shocks and repels even his best friends today he said your conversation reminds me of a * * novel how by the quantity of french you sprinkle over it do you wish to prevent us from understanding you no said trescott we are using french against africa we know the black waiters are all ears now and we want to keep what we have to say dark we cant afford to take them into our confidence you know this explanation trescott gave with great rapidity and many gestures toward the men standing behind us still speaking the french language his apology was exasperating so the judge glared at him and in unabated rage turned to talk with mr cheves who found it hard to keep a calm countenance on the battery with the rutledges captain hartstein was introduced to me he has done some heroic * home some ships and is a man of mark afterward he sent me a beautiful bouquet not half so beautiful however as mr robert * which already occupied the place of honor on my center table what a dear delightful place is charleston a lady who shall be nameless because of her story came to see me today her husband has been on the island with the troops for months she has just been down to see him she meant only to call on him but he persuaded her to stay two days she carried him some clothes made from his old measure now they are a mile too wide so much for a hard life i said no no said she they are all jolly down there he has trained down says it is good for him and he likes the life then she became confidential although it was her first visit to me a perfect stranger she had taken no clothes down * as she was in that manner under * tent but she managed things she tied her petticoat around her neck for a nightgown governor manning came to breakfast at our table the others had breakfasted hours before i looked at him in amazement as he was in full dress ready for a ball * and all and at that hour what is the matter with you nothing i am not mad most noble madam i am only going to the * my wife wants me taken thus he insisted on my going too and we captured mr chesnut and governor means the latter presented me with a book a * in which i am to * all the * doctor gibbes says the convention is in a * it was called as a secession convention a secession of places seems to be what it calls for first of all it has not stretched its eyes out to the yankees yet it has them turned inward * is its occupation still last night as i turned down the gas i said to myself certainly this has been one of the pleasantest days of my life i can only give the skeleton of it so many pleasant people so much good talk for after all it was talk talk talk la caroline du sud and yet the day began rather * mrs * and mrs tom middleton came for me and we drove to magnolia cemetery i saw william * broken column it was hard to shake off the blues after this graveyard business the others were off at a dinner party i dined ttette with langdon cheves so quiet so intelligent so very sensible withal there never was a pleasanter person or a better man than he while we were at table judge * tom frost and isaac hayne came they broke up our deeply interesting conversation for i was hearing what an honest and brave man feared for his country and then the rutledges dislodged the newcomers and bore me off to drive on the battery on the staircase met mrs izard who came for the same purpose on the battery governor adams stopped us he had heard of my saying he looked like marshal * and he came to say that at last i had made a personal remark which pleased him for once in my life when we came home mrs isaac hayne and chancellor carroll called to ask us to join their excursion to the island forts tomorrow with them was william haskell last summer at the white sulphur he was a pale slim student from the university today he is a soldier stout and robust a few months in camp with soldiering in the open air has worked this wonder camping out proves a wholesome life after all then came those nice sweet fresh * * girls we had a charming topic in * clever brother edward a letter from eliza b who is in montgomery mrs mallory got a letter from a lady in washington a few days ago who said that there had recently been several attempts to be gay in washington but they proved dismal failures the black republicans were invited and came and stared at their entertainers and their new republican companions looked unhappy while they said they were enchanted showed no * at the hardly stifled grumbling and * of our friends who thus found themselves condemned to meet their despised enemy i had a letter from the * today they say washington offers a perfect realization of goldsmiths deserted village celebrated my #* birthday but i am too old now to dwell in public on that unimportant anniversary a long dusty day ahead on those windy islands never for me so i was up early to write a note of excuse to chancellor carroll my husband went i hope anderson will not pay them the compliment of a salute with * guns as they pass fort sumter as pass they must here i am interrupted by an exquisite bouquet from the rutledges are there such roses anywhere else in the world now a loud banging at my door i get up in a pet and throw it wide open oh said john manning standing there smiling radiantly pray excuse the noise i made i mistook the number i thought it was rices room that is my excuse now that i am here come go with us to * everybody will be there who are not at the island to

at six and we dined ttette if he should prove as great a captain in ordering his line of battle as he is in ordering a dinner it will be as well for the country as it was for me today fortunately for the men the beautiful mrs joe heyward sits at the next table so they take her beauty as one of the goods the gods provide and it helps to make life pleasant with english * and venison from the west not to speak of the salmon from the lakes which began the feast they have me to listen an appreciative audience while they talk and mrs joe heyward to look at beauregard called he is the hero of the hour that is he is believed to be capable of great things a hero * was struck dumb because i said so far he has only been a captain of artillery or engineers or something i did not see him mrs wigfall did and reproached my * in not coming out last sunday at church beheld one of the peculiar local sights old negro * going up to the communion in their white * and kneeling devoutly around the chancel rail the morning papers say mr chesnut made the best shot on the island at target practice no war yet thank god likewise they tell me mr chesnut has made a capital speech in the convention not one word of what is going on now out of the fulness of the heart the mouth * says the * not so here our hearts are in doleful * but we are as gay as madly jolly as sailors who break into the * when the ship is going down at first in our great agony we were out alone we longed for some of our big brothers to come out and help us well they are out too and now it is fort sumter and that illadvised anderson there stands fort sumter en evidence and thereby hangs peace or war wigfall says before he left washington pickens our governor and trescott were openly against secession trescott does not pretend to like it now he * all the time but governor pickens is fireeater down to the ground at the white house mrs davis wore a badge jeff davis is no * says mrs wigfall captain ingraham comments in his rapid way words tumbling over each other out of his mouth now charlotte wigfall meant that as a fling at those people i think better of men who stop to think it is too rash to rush on as some do and so adds mrs wigfall the eleventhhour men are rewarded the * are traitors in this row met the lovely lucy * now mrs governor pickens last night at isaac haynes i saw miles now begging in dumb show for three violets she had in her breastpin she is a consummate actress and he well up in the part of male flirt so it was well done and you who are laughing in your sleeves at the scene where did you get that huge bunch oh there is no sentiment when there is a pile like that of anything oh oh today at the breakfast table there was a tragic * of * on the wellknown * who once more says in austere tones who is the flirt now and so we fool on into the black cloud ahead of us and after * cometh rue mr hayne said his wife moaned over the hardness of the * seats at st andrews hall at a * ball she was hopelessly deposited on one for hours and the walls are harder my dear what are your feelings to those of the poor old fellows leaning there with their beautiful young wives * as if they could never tire and in the arms of every man in the room watch their haggard weary faces the old boys you know at church i had to move my pew the lovely laura was too much for my boys they all made eyes at her and * each other and quarreled so for she gave them glance for glance wink * and * as they would she liked it i say my dear the old husbands have not exactly a bed of roses their wives twirling in the arms of young men they hugging the wall while we were at supper at the * wigfall was sent for to address a crowd before the mills house piazza like james fitz james when he visits glen * again it is to be in the saddle etc so let washington beware we were sad that we could not hear the speaking but the supper was a * de foie gras salad biscuit * and champagne * a ship was fired into yesterday and went back to sea is that the first shot how can one settle down to anything ones heart is in ones mouth all the time any moment the cannon may open on us the fleet come in the plot * the air is red hot with rumors the mystery is to find out where these utterly groundless tales * in spite of all tom huger came for us and we went on the planter to take a look at morris island and its present * wigfall and the cheves girls * gregg and colonel whiting also john rutledge of the navy dan hamilton and william haskell john rutledge was a * to be proud of he did not speak to us but he stood with a scotch shawl draped about him as handsome and stately a creature as ever queen elizabeth loved to look upon there came up such a wind we could not land i was not too sorry though it blew so hard i am never seasick colonel whiting explained everything about the forts what they lacked etc in the most interesting way and * gregg supplemented his report by stating all the deficiencies and shortcomings by land beauregard is a * here to most of the natives but there are always seers who see and say they give you to understand that whiting has all the brains now in use for our defense he does the work and beauregard * the glory things seem to draw near a crisis and one must think colonel whiting is clever enough for anything so we made up our minds today * gregg and i as judges mr gregg told me that my husband was in a minority in the convention so much for cool sense when the atmosphere is * mrs wigfall says we are * she should pair with my cool quiet * colonel and her stormy * is but a male reflection of me yesterday mrs wigfall and i made a few visits at the first house they wanted mrs wigfall to settle a dispute was she indeed fiftyfive fancy her face more than ten years bestowed upon her so freely then mrs gibbes asked me if i had ever been in charleston before says charlotte wigfall to pay me for my * when that false fifty was flung in her teeth and she thinks this is her native heath and her name is * she said it all came upon us for breaking the sabbath for indeed it was sunday allen green came up to speak to me at dinner in all his soldiers * it sent a shiver through me tried to read margaret fuller * but could not the air is too full of war news and we are all so restless went to see miss pinckney one of the last of the oldworld * she inquired particularly about a portrait of her father charles * pinckney which she said had been sent by him to my husbands grandfather i gave a good account of it it hangs in the place of honor in the drawingroom at mulberry she wanted to see my husband for his grandfather my fathers friend was one of the handsomest men of his day we came home and soon mr robert * and mr miles called governor manning walked in bowed gravely and seated himself by me again he bowed low in mock heroic style and with a grand wave of his hand said madame your country is invaded when i had breath to speak i asked what does he mean he meant this there are six * outside the bar talbot and chew have come to say that hostilities are to begin governor pickens and beauregard are holding a council of war mr chesnut then came in and confirmed the story wigfall next entered in boisterous spirits and said there was a sound of revelry by night in any stir or confusion my heart is apt to beat so painfully now the agony was so stifling i could hardly see or hear the men went off almost immediately and i crept silently to my room where i sat down to a good cry mrs wigfall came in and we had it out on the subject of civil war we * ourselves with dwelling on all its known horrors and then we added what we had a right to expect with yankees in front and negroes in the rear the slaveowners must expect a servile insurrection of course said mrs wigfall to make sure that we were unhappy enough suddenly loud shouting was heard we ran out cannon after cannon roared we met mrs allen green in the passageway with blanched cheeks and streaming eyes governor means rushed out of his room in his dressinggown and begged us to be calm governor pickens said he has ordered in the * of his wisdom seven cannon to be fired as a signal to the seventh regiment anderson will hear as well as the seventh regiment now you go back and be quiet fighting in the streets has not begun yet so we retired dr gibbes calls mrs allen green dame placid there was no placidity today with cannon bursting and allen on the island no sleep for anybody last night the streets were alive with soldiers men shouting marching singing wigfall the stormy * is in his glory the only thoroughly happy person i see today things seem to have settled down a little one can but hope still lincoln or seward has made such silly advances and then far * drawings back there may be a chance for peace after all things are happening so fast my husband has been made an aidedecamp to general beauregard three hours ago we were quickly packing to go home the convention has adjourned now he tells me the attack on fort sumter may begin tonight depends upon anderson and the fleet outside the herald says that this show of war outside of the bar is intended for texas john manning came in with his sword and red sash pleased as a boy to be on beauregards staff while the row goes on he has gone with wigfall to captain hartstein with instructions mr chesnut is finishing a report he had to make to the convention mrs hayne called she had she said but one feeling pity for those who are not here jack preston willie alston the * as they are called with john green the big brave have gone down to the * as privates seven hundred men were sent over ammunition wagons were rumbling along the streets all night anderson is burning blue lights signs and signals for the fleet outside i suppose today at dinner there was no allusion to things as they stand in charleston harbor there was an undercurrent of intense excitement there could not have been a more brilliant circle in addition to our usual quartette judge withers langdon cheves and trescott our two * dined with us means and manning these men all talked so delightfully for once in my life i listened that over business began in earnest governor means had * a sword and red sash from somewhere and brought it for colonel chesnut who had gone to demand the surrender of fort sumter and now * must wait why did that green goose anderson go into fort sumter then everything began to go wrong now they have intercepted a letter from him urging them to let him surrender he paints the horrors likely to ensue if they will not he ought to have thought of all that before he put his head in the hole anderson will not * yesterdays was the * maddest dinner we have had yet men were * wise and witty we had an unspoken foreboding that it was to be our last pleasant meeting mr miles dined with us today mrs henry king rushed in saying the news i come for the latest news all the men of the king family are on the island of which fact she seemed proud while she was here our peace * or * came * is mr chesnut returned his interview with colonel anderson had been deeply interesting but mr chesnut was not inclined to be communicative he wanted his dinner he felt for anderson and had telegraphed to president davis for * answer to give anderson etc he has now gone back to fort sumter with additional instructions when they were about to leave the wharf a h boykin sprang into the boat in great excitement he thought himself illused with a * of fighting and he to be left behind i do not pretend to go to sleep how can i if anderson does not accept terms at four the orders are he shall be fired upon i count four st * bells chime out and i begin to hope at halfpast four the heavy booming of a cannon i sprang out of bed and on my knees prostrate i prayed as i never prayed before there was a sound of stir all over the house pattering of feet in the corridors all seemed hurrying one way i put on my * and a shawl and went too it was to the housetop the shells were bursting in the dark i heard a man say waste of ammunition i knew my husband was rowing about in a boat somewhere in that dark bay and that the shells were * it over bursting toward the fort if anderson was obstinate colonel chesnut was to order the fort on one side to open fire certainly fire had begun the regular roar of the cannon there it was and who could tell what each volley accomplished of death and destruction the women were wild there on the housetop prayers came from the women and imprecations from the men and then a shell would light up the scene tonight they say the forces are to attempt to land we watched up there and everybody wondered that fort sumter did not fire a shot today miles and manning colonels now aides to beauregard dined with us the latter hoped i would keep the peace i gave him only good words for he was to be under fire all day and night down in the bay carrying orders etc last night or this morning truly up on the housetop i was so weak and weary i sat down on something that looked like a black stool get up you foolish woman your dress is on fire cried a man and he put me out i was on a chimney and the sparks had caught my clothes susan preston and mr venable then came up but my fire had been extinguished before it burst out into a regular blaze do you know after all that noise and our tears and prayers nobody has been hurt sound and fury signifying * delusion and a snare louisa hamilton came here now this is a sort of news center jack hamilton her handsome young husband has all the credit of a famous battery which is made of railroad iron mr petigru calls it the * because it throws the balls back the way they came so lou hamilton tells us during her first marriage she had no children hence the value of this lately achieved baby to divert louisa from the glories of the battery of which she raves we asked if the baby could talk yet no not exactly but he * the big gun when he hears that he * his hands and cries boom boom her mind is distinctly occupied by three things lieutenant hamilton whom she calls randolph the baby and the big gun and it refuses to hold more pryor of virginia spoke from the piazza of the charleston hotel i asked what he said an irreverent woman replied oh they all say the same thing but he made great play with that long hair of his which he is always tossing aside somebody came in just now and reported colonel chesnut asleep on the sofa in general beauregards room after two such nights he must be so tired as to be able to sleep anywhere just bade farewell to langdon cheves he is forced to go home and leave this interesting place says he feels like the man that was not killed at * i think he said that unfortunate had to hang himself when he got home for very shame maybe he fell on his sword which was the strictly classic way of ending matters i do not wonder at louisa hamiltons baby we hear nothing can listen to nothing boom boom goes the cannon all the time the nervous strain is awful alone in this darkened room richmond and washington ablaze say the * with excitement why not to us these last days events seem frightfully great we were all women on that iron balcony men are only seen at a distance now stark means marching under the piazza at the head of his regiment held his cap in his hand all the time he was in sight mrs means was leaning over and looking with tearful eyes when an unknown creature asked why did he take his hat off mrs means stood straight up and said he did that in honor of his mother he saw me she is a proud mother and at the same time most unhappy her lovely daughter emma is dying in there before her eyes of consumption at that moment i am sure mrs means had a spasm of the heart at least she looked as i feel sometimes she took my arm and we came in nobody has been hurt after all how gay we were last night reaction after the dread of all the slaughter we thought those dreadful cannon were making not even a battery the worse for wear fort sumter has been on fire anderson has not yet silenced any of our guns so the aides still with swords and red sashes by way of uniform tell us but the sound of those guns makes regular meals impossible none of us go to table * pervade the corridors going everywhere some of the anxious hearts lie on their beds and moan in solitary misery mrs wigfall and i solace ourselves with tea in my room these women have all a satisfying faith god is on our side they say when we are shut in mrs wigfall and i ask why of course he hates the yankees we are told youll think that well of him not by one word or look can we detect any change in the demeanor of these negro servants lawrence sits at our door sleepy and respectful and profoundly indifferent so are they all but they carry it too far you could not tell that they even heard the awful roar going on in the bay though it has been * in their ears night and day people talk before them as if they were chairs and tables they make no sign are they * stupid or wiser than we are silent and strong * their time so tea and toast came also came colonel manning red sash and sword to announce that he had been under fire and didnt mind it he said gaily it is one of those things a fellow never knows how he will come out until he has been tried now i know i am a worthy descendant of my old irish hero of an ancestor who held the british officer before him as a shield in the revolution and backed out of danger gracefully we talked of st valentines eve or the maid of * and the drop of the white does blood that sometimes spoiled all the * are still there outside the bar and there are people who thought the charleston bar no good to charleston the bar is the silent partner or sleeping partner and in this fray it is doing us * service i did not know that one could live such days of excitement some one called come out there is a crowd coming a mob it was indeed but it was headed by colonels chesnut and manning the crowd was shouting and showing these two as messengers of good news they were escorted to beauregards headquarters fort sumter had surrendered those upon the housetops shouted to us the fort is on fire that had been the story once or twice before when we had calmed down colonel chesnut who had taken it all quietly enough if anything more * than usual in his serenity told us how the surrender came about wigfall was with them on morris island when they saw the fire in the fort he jumped in a little boat and with his handkerchief as a white flag rowed over wigfall went in through a * when colonel chesnut arrived shortly after and was received at the regular entrance colonel anderson told him he had need to pick his way warily for the place was all * as far as i can make out the fort surrendered to wigfall but it is all confusion our flag is flying there * have been sent for to put out the fire everybody tells you half of something and then rushes off to tell something else or to hear the last news in the afternoon mrs preston mrs joe heyward and i drove around the battery we were in an open carriage what a changed * very * crowd i think i ever saw everybody talking at once all glasses were still turned on the grim old fort russell the correspondent of the london times was there they took him everywhere one man got out thackeray to converse with him on equal terms poor russell was awfully bored they say he only wanted to see the fort and to get news suitable to make up into an interesting article thackeray had become stale over the water mrs frank hampton and i went to see the camp of the richland troops south carolina college had volunteered to a boy professor venable the mathematical intends to raise a company from among them for the war a permanent company this is a grand frolic no more for the students at least even the staid and severe of aspect clingman is here he says virginia and north carolina are arming to come to our rescue for now the north will swoop down on us of that we may be sure we have burned our ships we are obliged to go on now he calls us a poor little * headlong rash and troublesome sister state general * is in a rage because we are to send troops to virginia preston hampton is in all the flush of his youth and beauty six feet in stature and after all only in his * he appeared in fine clothes and * kid gloves to grace the scene the camp in a fit of * seized him and rubbed him in the mud he fought manfully but took it all naturally as a good joke mrs frank hampton knows already what civil war means her brother was in the new york seventh regiment so roughly received in baltimore frank will be in the opposite camp good stories there may be and to spare for russell the man of the london times who has come over here to find out our weakness and our strength and to tell all the rest of the world about us amden s c april 20 #* again at mulberry in those last days of my stay in charleston i did not find time to write a word and so we took fort sumter nous * * frank hampton and * the passageway of the mills house between the * and the drawingroom for there we held a sofa against all comers all the agreeable people south seemed to have flocked to charleston at the first gun that was after we had found out that * did not kill anybody before that we wept and prayed and took our tea in groups in our rooms away from the haunts of men captain ingraham and his kind also took fort * the battery with fieldglasses and figures made with their sticks in the sand to show what ought to be done wigfall chesnut miles manning took it rowing about the harbor in small boats from fort to fort under the enemys guns with bombs bursting in air and then the boys and men who worked those guns so faithfully at the * took it too in their own way old colonel beaufort watts told me this story and many more of the * * under fire they took the fire easily as they do most things they had cotton bag * at fort moultrie and when andersons shot knocked them about some one called out cotton is falling then down went the kitchen chimney loaves of bread flew out and they cheered gaily shouting * are rising willie preston fired the shot which broke andersons flagstaff mrs hampton from columbia telegraphed him well done willie she is his grandmother the wife or widow of general hampton of the revolution and the * sweetest gentlest of old ladies this shows how the war spirit is waking us all up colonel miles who won his spurs in a boat so william gilmore simms said gave us this characteristic anecdote they met a negro out in the bay rowing toward the city with some plantation supplies etc are you not afraid of colonel andersons cannon he was asked no * mars anderson aint * hit me he know marster wouldnt low it i have been sitting idly today looking out upon this beautiful lawn wondering if this can be the same world i was in a few days ago after the smoke and the din of the battle a calm arranging my photograph book on the first page colonel watts here goes a sketch of his life romantic enough surely beaufort watts * blood gentleman to the tips of his fingers chivalry * he was placed in charge of a large amount of money in bank bills the money belonged to the state and he was to deposit it in the bank on the way he was obliged to stay over one night he put the roll on a table at his bedside locked himself in and slept the sleep of the righteous lo next day when he * the money was gone well all who knew him believed him innocent of course he searched and they searched high and low but to no purpose the money had vanished it was a damaging story in spite of his previous character and a cloud rested on him years afterward the house in which he had taken that disastrous sleep was pulled down in the wall behind the * was found his pile of money how the rats got it through so narrow a crack it seemed hard to realize like the hole mentioned by * it was not as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door but it did for beaufort watts until the money was found suppose that house had been burned or the rats had * up the bills past recognition people in power understood how this proud man suffered those many years in silence many men looked * at him the country tried to repair the work of * the mans character he was made secretary of legation to russia and was afterward our consul at santa f de * when he was too old to wander far afield they made him secretary to all the governors of south carolina in regular succession i knew him more than twenty years ago as secretary to the governor he was a * old battered dandy the soul of honor his eccentricities were all humored misfortune had made him sacred he stood hat in hand before ladies and bowed as i suppose sir charles * might have done it was hard not to laugh at the purple and green shades of his * hair he came at one time to show me the sword presented to colonel * for killing the only indian who was killed in the * war we * osceola and * under a flag of * is they were * not shot on the wing to go back to my * he knelt handed me the sword and then kissed my hand i was barely sixteen and did not know how to behave under the circumstances he said leaning on the sword my dear child learn that it is a much greater liberty to shake hands with a lady than to kiss her hand i have kissed the empress of * hand and she did not make faces at me he looks now just as he did then he is in uniform covered with * * etc shining in the sun and with his plumed hat reins up his * and bows low as ever now i will bid farewell for a while as * did to all the pomp pride and circumstance of glorious war and come down to my domestic * and troubles i have a sort of volunteer maid the daughter of my husbands nurse dear old betsy she waits on me because she so pleases besides i pay her she belongs to my fatherinlaw who has too many slaves to care very much about their way of life so maria whitaker came all in tears she brushes hair delightfully and as she stood at my back i could see her face in the glass maria are you crying because all this war talk * you said i no maam what is the matter with you nothing more than common now listen let the war end either way and you will be free we will have to free you before we get out of this thing wont you be glad everybody knows mars jeems wants us free and it is only old marster holds hard he aint going to free anybody any way you see and then came the story of her troubles now miss mary you see me married to jeems whitaker yourself i was a good and faithful wife to him and we were comfortable every * house everything he had no cause of complaint but he has left me for heavens sake why because i had twins he says they are not his because nobody named whitaker ever had twins maria is proud in her way and the behavior of this bad husband has nearly mortified her to death she has had three children in two years no wonder the man was frightened but then maria does not depend on him for anything she was inconsolable and i could find nothing better to say than come now maria never mind your old missis and marster are so good to you now let us look up something for the twins the twins are named john and jeems the latter for her false * of a husband maria is one of the good colored women she deserved a better fate in her honest matrimonial attempt but they do say she has a trying temper jeems was tried and he failed to stand the trial note the glaring inconsistencies of life our * locked up eugene sue and returned even washington * novel with thanks and a decided hint that it should be burned at least it should not remain in her house bad books are not allowed house room except in the library under lock and key the key in the masters pocket but bad women if they are not white or serve in a * capacity may swarm the house unmolested the ostrich game is thought a christian act such women are no more regarded as a dangerous contingent than canary birds would be if you show by a chance remark that you see some particular creature more shameless than the rest has no end of children and no beginning of a husband you are frowned down you are talking on improper subjects there are certain subjects * ladies never touch upon even in their thoughts it does not do to be so hard and cruel it is best to let the sinners alone poor things if they are good servants otherwise do not dismiss them all that will come straight as they grow older and it does they are frantic one and all to be members of the church the methodist church is not so * as to shut its eyes it takes them up and turns them out with a high hand if they are found

goodness above all things everywhere when the car stopped the people wanted a speech and we had one stream of fervid oratory we came along with a man whose wife lived in washington he was bringing her to georgia as the safest place the alabama crowd are not as confident of taking fort pickens as we were of taking fort sumter baltimore is in a blaze they say colonel ben huger is in command * of the * huger general robert e lee son of light horse harry lee has been made generalinchief of virginia with such men to the fore we have hope the new york herald says slavery must be extinguished if in blood it thinks we are shaking in our shoes at their great mass meetings we are jolly as * all the same mr chesnut has gone with wade hampton to see president davis about the legion wade wants to get up the president came across the aisle to speak to me at church today he was very cordial and i appreciated the honor wigfall is black with rage at colonel andersons account of the fall of sumter wigfall did behave * but anderson does not seem to see it in that light catch me risking my life to save him again says wigfall he might have been man enough to tell the truth to those new yorkers however unpalatable to them a good word for us might have been we did behave well to him the only men of his killed he killed himself or they killed themselves firing a salute to their old striped rag mr chesnut was delighted with the way anderson spoke to him when he went to demand the surrender they parted quite tenderly anderson said if we do not meet again on earth i hope we may meet in heaven how wigfall laughed at anderson giving chesnut a howdy in the other world what a kind welcome the old gentlemen gave me one more affectionate and homely than the others slapped me on the back several bouquets were brought me and i put them in water around my plate then general owens gave me some violets which i put in my breastpin oh said my * * * if i had known how those bouquets were to be honored i would have been up by daylight seeking the sweetest flowers governor moore came in and of course seats were offered him this is a most comfortable chair cried an * polite person the most comfortable chair is beside mrs chesnut said the governor facing the music gallantly as he sank into it gracefully well done old * browne said these southern men have an awfully flattering way with women oh so many are descendants of irishmen and so the * remains yet even and in spite of their gray hairs for it was a group of * * yes * as well as bravery came in with the irish at mrs daviss reception dismal news for civil war seems certain at mrs toombss reception mr stephens came by me twice before we have had it out on the subject of this confederacy once on the cars coming from georgia here once at a supper where he sat next to me today he was not cheerful in his views i called him * and accused him of looking back man after man came and interrupted the conversation with some * but we held on he was deeply interesting and he gave me some new ideas as to our dangerous situation fears for the future and not exultation at our successes pervade his discourse dined at the presidents and never had a pleasanter day he is as witty as he is wise he was very agreeable he took me in to dinner the talk was of washington nothing of our present difficulties a general anderson from alexandria d c was in doleful * he says the north are so much better prepared than we are they are organized or will be by general scott we are in wild confusion their army is the best in the world we are wretchedly armed etc etc they have ships and arms that were ours and theirs mrs walker * dressed one of those * arrayed persons who fairly shine in the sun tells me she mistook the inevitable morrow for mr chesnut and added pass over the affront to my powers of selection i told her it was an insult to the palmetto flag think of a south carolina senator like that men come rushing in from washington with white lips crying danger danger it is very tiresome to have these people always * on this the enemys troops are the finest body of men we ever saw why did you not make friends of them i feel disposed to say we would have war and now we seem to be letting our golden opportunity pass we are not preparing for war there is talk talk talk in that * * and rash reckless headlong * proud passionate unruly raw material for soldiers they say we have among us a regiment of spies men and women sent here by the wily seward why our newspapers tell every word there is to be told by friend or foe a * call from hon robert barnwell his theory is all would have been right if we had taken fort sumter six months ago he made this very plain to me he is clever if erratic i forget why it ought to have been attacked before at another reception mrs davis was in fine spirits captain * was here came over in his own yacht russell of the london times wondered how we had the heart to enjoy life so thoroughly when all the northern papers said we were to be * in such a short time virginia commissioners here mr staples and mr * came to see me they say virginia has no grievance she comes out on a point of honor could she stand by and see her sovereign sister states invaded sumter anderson has been offered a kentucky regiment can they raise a regiment in kentucky against us in kentucky our sister state suddenly general beauregard and his aide the last left him of the galaxy who surrounded him in charleston john manning have * knows where but out on a * certainly governor manning called himself the last rose of summer left blooming alone of that fancy staff a new fight will gather them again ben mcculloch the texas * is here and mr ward my * * friends colleague from texas senator ward in appearance is the exact opposite of senator * the latter with the face of an old man has the hair of a boy of twenty mr ward is fresh and fair with blue eyes and a boyish face but his head is white as snow whether he turned it white in a single night or by slower process i do not know but it is strangely out of keeping with his clear young eye he is thin and has a queer stooping figure this story he told me of his own experience on a western steamer there was a great crowd and no unoccupied berth or sleeping place of any sort whatsoever in the * * i think they called it he had taken a stateroom 110 but he could not * the people who had already seized it and were asleep in it neither could the captain it would have been a case of revolver or * inch * near the ladies saloon the steward took pity on him this man said he is 110 and i can find no place for him poor fellow there was a peep out of bright eyes i say steward have you a man 110 years old out there let us see him he must be a natural curiosity we are overcrowded was the answer and we cant find a place for him to sleep poor old soul bring him in here we will take care of him stoop and totter * the steward to no 110 and go in ah said mr ward how those * patted and pitied me and hustled me about and gave me the best berth i tried not to look i knew it was wrong but i looked i saw them * their back hair and was lost in amazement at the collapse when the huge hoopskirts fell off unheeded on the cabin floor one beauty who was * herself near his curtain suddenly caught his eye she stooped and gathered up her belongings as she said i say * your old hundred and ten is a humbug his eyes are too blue for anything and she fled as he shut himself in nearly frightened to death i forget how it ended there was so much laughing at his story i did not hear it all so much for hoary locks and their * power russell the wandering english newspaper correspondent was telling how very odd some of our plantation habits were he was staying at the house of an * minister and madame would stand on the back piazza and send her voice three fields off calling a servant now that is not a southern peculiarity our women are soft and sweet * indolent graceful * i dare say there are * * vulgar people everywhere we have been down from montgomery on the boat to that * landing portland ala found everybody * is the three men who were there at last secured a carriage to carry us to my * house mr chesnut had to drive seven miles pitch dark over an unknown road my heart was in my mouth which last i did not open next day a patriotic person informed us that so great was the war fever only six men could be found in dallas county i whispered to mr chesnut we found three of the lone ones hors de combat at portland so much for the corps of * patriots saw for the first time the demoralization produced by hopes of freedom my mothers butler whom i taught to read sitting on his * contrived to keep from speaking to us he was as efficient as ever in his proper place but he did not come behind the scenes as usual and have a friendly chat held himself aloof so grand and stately we had to send him a tip through his wife hetty mothers maid who however showed no signs of disaffection she came to my bedside next morning with everything that was nice for breakfast she had let me sleep till midday and embraced me over and over again i remarked what a capital cook they have here she * to the ground i cooked every mouthful on that * if i did not know what you liked to eat since you was a baby mrs fitzpatrick says mr davis is too gloomy for her he says we must prepare for a long war and * reverses at first because they are * for war and so much stronger numerically men and money count so in war as they do everywhere else said i doubting her accurate account of mr daviss spoken words though she tried to give them faithfully we need patience and persistence there is enough and to spare of pluck and dash among us the * style i drove out with mrs davis she finds playing mrs president of this small confederacy slow work after leaving friends such as mrs emory and mrs joe johnston in washington i do not blame her the wrench has been awful with us all but we dont mean to be turned into pillars of salt mr mallory came for us to go to mrs toombss reception mr chesnut would not go and i decided to remain with him this proved a wise decision first mr hunter came in college they called him from his initials r m t run mad tom hunter just now i think he is the * if not the wisest man in our newborn confederacy i remember when i first met him he sat next to me at some state dinner in washington mr clay had taken me in to dinner but seemed quite satisfied that my other side should take me off his hands mr hunter did not know me nor i him i suppose he inquired or looked at my card lying on the table as i looked at his at any rate we began a conversation which lasted steadily through the whole thing from soup to dessert mr hunter though in evening dress presented a rather * appearance his * wanted pulling down and his hair wanted * he delivered unconsciously that day a lecture on english literature which if printed i still think would be a valuable addition to that literature since then i have always looked forward to a talk with the senator from virginia with undisguised pleasure next came mr miles and mr * of south carolina the latter was president of our secession convention also has written a life of du * that is not so bad so my unexpected reception was of the most charming judge frost came a little later they all remained until the return of the crowd from mrs toombss these men are not * cant say without hope exactly they are agreed in one thing it is worth while to try a while if only to get away from new england captain ingraham was here too he is south carolina to the tips of his fingers yet he has it dyed in the * is part of his * believe the united states navy can whip anything in the world all of these little inconsistencies and * make the times very exciting one never knows what tack any one of them will take at the next word lunched at mrs daviss everything nice to eat and i was * for a fortnight i have not even gone to the dinner table yesterday i was forced to dine on cold asparagus and blackberries so repulsive in aspect was the other food they sent me mrs davis was as nice as the luncheon when she is in the mood i do not know so pleasant a person she is awfully clever always we talked of this move from montgomery mr chesnut * it violently because this is so central a position for our government he wants our troops sent into maryland in order to make our fight on the border and so to * washington i see that the uncomfortable hotels here will at last move the congress our statesmen love their ease and it will be hot here in summer i do hope they will go mrs davis said the yankees will make it hot for us go where we will and truly so if war comes and it has come said i yes i fancy these dainty folks may live to regret losing even the fare of the montgomery hotels never mr chesnut has three distinct * the maryland scheme is one and he rushes off to jeff davis who i dare say has fifty men every day come to him with infallible plans to save the country if only he can keep his temper mrs davis says he answers all advisers in softly modulated * accents what a rough menagerie we have here and if nice people come to see you up walks an irate judge who * the conversation and abuses the friends of the company generally that is abuses everybody and * every possible evil to the country provided he finds that denouncing your friends does not sufficiently * you everybody has * north too by the papers but of mr chesnuts three * maryland is to be made the seat of war old * idea of buying up steamers abroad for our coast defenses should be adopted and last of all but far from the least we must make much cotton and send it to england as a bank to draw on the very cotton we have now if sent across the water would be a gold mine to us * s c may 25 #* have come back to south carolina from the montgomery congress stopping over at mulberry we came with r m t hunter and mr barnwell mr barnwell has excellent reasons for keeping cotton at home but i forget what they are generally people take what he says also mr hunters wisdom as unanswerable not so mr chesnut who growls at both much as he likes them we also had tom lang and his wife and doctor boykin surely there never was a more congenial party the younger men had been in the south carolina college while mr barnwell was president their love and respect for him were immeasurable and he benignly received it smiling behind those spectacles met john darby at atlanta and told him he was surgeon of the hampton legion which delighted him he had had adventures with only a few moments on the platform to interchange confidences he said he had remained a little too long in the medical college in philadelphia where he was some kind of a professor and they had been within an ace of hanging him as a southern spy rope was ready he * at atlanta when he * said he was fresh from philadelphia he barely escaped * being taken for a northern spy lively life i am having among you on both sides he said hurrying away and i moaned here was john darby like to have been killed by both sides and no time to tell me the curious coincidences what marvelous experiences a little war begins to produce they look for a fight at norfolk beauregard is there i think if i were a man id be there too also harpers ferry is to be attacked the confederate flag has been cut down at alexandria by a man named ellsworth who was in command of zouaves jackson was the name of the person who shot ellsworth in the act sixty of our cavalry have been taken by shermans brigade deeper and deeper we go in thirty of tom boykins company have come home from richmond they went as a rifle company armed with muskets they were sandhill * fastidious ones not very anxious to fight with anything or in any way i fancy richmond ladies had come for them in carriages fted them waved handkerchiefs to them brought them dainties with their own hands in the faith that every carolinian was a gentleman and every man south of mason and dixons line a hero but these are not exactly descendants of the scotch hay who fought the * with his plowshare or the * yoke or something that could hit hard and that came handy johnny has gone as a private in greggs regiment he could not stand it at home any longer mr chesnut was willing for him to go because those sandhill men said this was a rich mans war and the rich men would be the officers and have an easy time and the poor ones would be privates so he said let the gentlemen set the example let them go in the ranks so john chesnut is a gentleman private he took his servant with him all the same johnny * me for saying if i were a man i would not sit here and * and drink and * and forget the fight going on in virginia he said it was my duty not to talk so rashly and make enemies he had the money in his pocket to raise a company last fall but it has slipped through his fingers and now he is a common soldier you wasted it or spent it foolishly said i i do not know where it has gone said he there was too much consulting over me too much good counsel was given to me and everybody gave me different advice dont you ever know your own mind we will do very well in the ranks men and officers all alike we know everybody so i repeated mrs * solemn words when she heard that south carolina had seceded alone as thy days so shall thy strength be dont know exactly what i meant but thought i must be impressive as he was going away saw him off at the train forgot to say anything there but cried my eyes out sent mrs wigfall a * shrieks the wild * she answered * at the spotswood hotel will shriek soon i will remain here davin have had a talk concerning him today with two opposite extremes of people mrs chesnut my motherinlaw praises everybody good and bad judge not she says she is a philosopher she would not give herself the pain to find fault the judge abuses everybody and he does it so * sharp and incisive are his sentences and he revels in * the world en * as the french say so nobody is the better for her good word or the worse for his bad one in camden i found myself in a flurry of women traitors they cried spies they ought to be hanged davin is taken up * and davis are his * what has davin done hell be hanged never you mind for what they caught him walking on the * work in the swamp after no good you may be sure they wont hang him for that hanging is too good for him you wait till colonel chesnut comes he is a lawyer i said gravely ladies he will disappoint you there will be no * if he goes to that meeting today he will not move a step except by habeas corpus and trial by jury and a quantity of bench and bar to speak long speeches mr chesnut did come and gave a more definite account of poor * precarious situation they had intercepted treasonable letters of his at the post office i believe it was not a very black treason after all at any rate mr chesnut spoke for him with might and main at the meeting it was composed the meeting of intelligent men with cool heads and they banished davin to fort sumter the poor music master cant do much harm in the * there he may thank his stars that mr chesnut gave him a helping hand in the red hot state our public mind now is in there will be a short * for spies judge withers said that mr chesnut never made a more telling speech in his life than he did to save this poor frenchman for whom judge lynch was ready i had never heard of davin in my life until i heard he was to be hanged judge stephen a douglas the little giant is dead one of those killed by the war no doubt trouble of mind charleston people are * they shrink from russells touches i find his criticisms mild he has a light touch i expected so much worse those englishmen come somebody says with three * paper prejudices i dread some of those * stories as to that day in the harbor he let us off easily he says our men are so fine looking who denies it not one of us also that it is a silly impression which has gone abroad that men can not work in this climate we live in the open air and work like * at all manly sports riding hard hunting playing at being soldiers these fine manly specimens have been in the habit of leaving the coast when it became too hot there and also of fighting a duel or two if kept long * under a charleston sun handsome youths whose size and muscle he admired so much as they * around the mills house would not relish hard work in the fields between may and december negroes stand a tropical or * sun at noonday better than white men in fighting it is different men will not then mind sun or rain or wind major emory when he was ordered west placed his resignation in the hands of his maryland brothers after the baltimore row the brothers sent it in but maryland declined to secede mrs emory who at least is twothirds of that copartnership being old franklins granddaughter and true to her blood tried to get it back the president refused point blank though she went on her knees that i do not believe the franklin race are * and * not much given to kneeling to god or man from all accounts if major emory comes to us wont he have a good time mrs davis adores mrs emory no wonder i fell in love with her myself i heard of her before i saw her in this wise little banks told me the story she was dancing at a ball when some bad accident maker for the evening news rushed up and informed her that major emory had been * by ten indians somewhere out west she coolly answered him that she had later intelligence it was not so turning a deaf ear then she went on dancing next night the same officious fool met her with this congratulation oh mrs emory it was all a * the major is alive she cried you are always running about with your bad news and turned her back on him or i think it was you delight in spiteful stories or you are a harbinger of evil banks is a newspaper man and knows how to arrange an anecdote for effect have been looking at mrs * as she burnished the * * before waterloo and i have been busy too my husband has gone to join beauregard somewhere beyond richmond i feel * with melancholy but i hope to be in richmond before long myself that is some comfort the war is making us all tenderly sentimental no casualties yet no real mourning nobody hurt so it is all parade fife and fine feathers posing we are en grande * there is no imagination here to * woe and only the excitement and wild awakening from everyday stagnant life are felt that is when one gets away from the two or three sensible men who are still left in the world when beauregards report of the capture of fort sumter was printed willie ancrum said how is this tom ancrum and ham boykins names are not here we thought from what they told us that they did most of the fighting colonel magruder has done something splendid on the peninsula bethel is the name of the battle three hundred of the enemy killed they say our people southerners i mean continue to drop in from the outside world and what a contempt those who seceded a few days sooner feel for those who have just come out a camden notable called jim * said in the street today at heart robert e lee is against us that i know what will not people say in war times also he said that colonel kershaw wanted general beauregard to change the name of the stream near manassas station bulls run is so * beauregard answered let us try and make it as great a name as your south carolina * mrs chesnut born in philadelphia can not see what right we have to take mt vernon from our northern sisters she thinks that ought to be common to both parties we think they will get their share of this worlds goods do what we may and we will keep mt vernon if we can no comfort in mr chesnuts letter from richmond unutterable confusion prevails and discord already in charleston a butcher has been * supplying the yankee fleet outside the bar with beef they say he gave the information which led to the capture of the savannah they will hang him mr petigru alone in south carolina has not seceded when they pray for our president he gets up from his knees he might risk a prayer for mr davis i doubt if it would seriously do mr davis any good mr petigru is too clever to think himself one of the righteous whose prayers avail so * much mr * * mr bryan followed his example mr petigru has such a keen sense of the ridiculous he must be laughing in his sleeve at the * this untimely trait of independence has raised looking out for a battle at manassas station i am always ill the name of my disease is a longing to get away from here and to go to richmond in england mr * and mr * rise to say a good word for us heaven reward them shower down its choicest blessings on their devoted heads as the fiction folks say barnwell heyward telegraphed me to meet him at kingsville but i was at cool spring * plantation and all my clothes were at sandy hill our home in the sand hills so i lost that good opportunity of the very nicest escort to richmond tried to rise above the agonies of everyday life read emerson too * on the brain russells letters are filled with rubbish about our wanting an english prince to reign over us he actually intimates that the noisy arming * marching proclaiming at the north * us yes as the making of faces and turning of * by the chinese scared the english mr * has written a letter it is in the * of philadelphia he offers lincoln his life and fortune all that he has put at lincolns disposal to conquer us queer we only want to separate from them and they put such an inordinate value on us they are willing to risk all life and limb and all their money to keep us they love us so mr chesnut is accused of firing the first shot and his cousin an * pointer writes in a martial fury they confounded the best shot made on the island the day of the picnic with the first shot at fort sumter this last is claimed by captain james others say it was one of the * who first fired but it was anderson who fired the train which blew up the union he slipped into fort sumter that night when we expected to talk it all over a letter from my husband dated headquarters manassas junction june 16 1861 mary hammy and myself are off for richmond rev mr * of the methodist persuasion goes with us we are to be under his care * lowering isaac hayne the man who fought a duel with ben alston across the dinnertable and yet lives is the bravest of the brave he attacks russell in the * the public * saying we wanted an english prince to the fore not we indeed every man wants to be at the head of affairs himself if he can not be king himself then a republic of course it was hardly necessary to do more than laugh at russells absurd idea there was a great deal of the wildest kind of talk at the mills house russell writes candidly enough of the british in india we can hardly expect him to suppress what is to our detriment last night i was awakened by loud talking and candles flashing tramping of feet growls dying away in the distance loud calls from point to point in the yard up i started my heart in my mouth some dreadful thing had happened a battle a death a horrible accident some one was screaming * is from the top of the stairway hoarsely like a * in a storm old colonel chesnut was storming at the sleepy negroes looking for fire with lighted candles in closets and everywhere else i dressed and came upon the scene of action what is it any news no no only mamma smells a smell she thinks something is burning somewhere the whole yard was alive literally swarming there are sixty or seventy people kept here to wait upon this household twothirds of them too old or too young to be of any use but families remain intact the old colonel has a magnificent voice i am sure it can be heard for miles literally he was roaring from the piazza giving orders to the busy crowd who were hunting the smell of fire old mrs chesnut is deaf so she did not know what a commotion she was creating she is very sensitive to bad odors candles have to be taken out of the room to be snuffed lamps are extinguished only in the * or farther afield she finds violets oppressive can only tolerate a single kind of sweet rose a * she will not have in her room she was totally innocent of the storm she had raised and in a mild sweet voice was suggesting places to be searched i was weak enough to laugh hysterically the bombardment of fort sumter was nothing to this after this alarm enough to wake the dead the smell was found a family had been boiling soap around the * they had swept up some woolen rags raking up the fire to make all safe before going to bed this was heaped up with the ashes and its faint smoldering tainted the air at least to mrs chesnuts nose two hundred yards or more away yesterday some of the negro men on the plantation were found with pistols i have never before seen aught about any negro to show that they knew we had a war on hand in which they have any interest mrs john de saussure bade me goodby and god bless you i was touched camden people never show any more feeling or sympathy than red indians except at a funeral it is expected of all to howl then and if you dont show feeling indignation awaits the delinquent ichmond va june 27 #* * was perfect in the part of traveling companion he had his pleasures too the most pious and eloquent of parsons is human and he enjoyed the converse of the eminent persons who turned up on every hand and gave their views freely on all matters of state mr lawrence keitt joined us en route with him came his wife and baby we dont think alike but mr keitt is always original and entertaining already he pronounces jeff davis a failure and his cabinet a farce prophetic i suggested as he gave his opinion before the administration had fairly got under way he was fierce in his faultfinding as to mr chesnuts vote for jeff davis he says mr chesnut * the judge and those two turned the tide at least with the south carolina delegation we * as we always do he says howell cobbs common sense might have saved us two quiet unobtrusive yankee * were on the train i had spoken to them and they had told me all about themselves so i wrote on a scrap of paper do not abuse our home and house so before these yankee strangers going north those girls are * returning from whence they came soldiers everywhere they seem to be in the air and certainly to fill all space keitt quoted a funny georgia man who says we try our soldiers to see if they are hot enough before we enlist them if when water is thrown on them they do not * they wont do their patriotism is too cool to show they were wide awake and sympathizing enthusiastically every woman from every window of every house we passed waved a handkerchief if she had one this fluttering of white flags from every side never ceased from camden to richmond another new * of girls came to every station simply to look at the troops passing they always stood the girls i mean in solid * and as the sun was generally in their eyes they made faces mary hammy never tired of laughing at this peculiarity of her sister patriots at the depot in richmond mr mallory with wigfall and garnett met us we had no cause to complain of the warmth of our reception they had a carriage for us and our rooms were taken at the spotswood but then the people who were in the rooms engaged for us had not departed at the time they said they were going they lingered among the delights of richmond and we knew of no law to make them keep their words and go mrs preston had gone for a few days to manassas so we took her room mrs davis is as kind as ever she met us in one of the corridors accidentally and asked us to join her party and to take our meals at her table mr preston came and we moved into a room so small there was only space for a bed washstand and glass over it my things were hung up out of the way on nails behind the door as soon as my husband heard we had arrived he came too after dinner he sat smoking the solitary chair of the apartment tilted against the door as he smoked and my poor dresses were * i remonstrated feebly war times said he nobody is * now when i go back to manassas tomorrow you will be awfully sorry you snubbed me about those * things up there so he smoked the pipe of peace for i knew that his remarks were painfully true as soon as he was once more under the enemys guns i would repent in sackcloth and ashes captain ingraham came with colonel lamar the latter said he could only stay five minutes he was obliged to go back at once to his camp that was a little before eight however at twelve he was still talking to us on that sofa we taunted him with his fine words to the f f v crowd before the spotswood virginia has no grievance she raises her strong arm to catch the blow aimed at her weaker sisters he liked it well however that we knew his speech by heart this spotswood is a miniature world the war topic is not so much avoided as that everybody has some personal dignity to take care of and everybody else is indifferent to it i mean the personal dignity of * in this wild confusion everything likely and * is told you and then everything is as flatly contradicted at any rate it is safest not to talk of the war trescott was telling us how they laughed at little south carolina in washington people said it was almost as large as long island which is hardly more than a * of new york always there is a child who * and wont play that was our rle and we were posing as san * and all * though small republics pose he tells us that lincoln is a humorist lincoln sees the fun of things he thinks if they had left us in a corner or out in the cold a while pouting with our fingers in our mouth by hook or by crook he could have got us back but anderson spoiled all in mrs daviss drawingroom last night the president took a seat by me on the sofa where i sat he talked for nearly an hour he laughed at our faith in our own powers we are like the british we think every southerner equal to three yankees at least we will have to be equivalent to a dozen now after his experience of the fighting qualities of southerners in mexico he believes that we will do all that can be done by pluck and muscle endurance and dogged courage dash and redhot patriotism and yet his tone was not sanguine there was a sad refrain running through it all for one thing either way he thinks it will be a long war that floored me at once it has been too long for me already then he said before the end came we would have many a bitter experience he said only fools doubted the courage of the yankees or their willingness to fight when they saw fit and now that we have stung their pride we have roused them till they will fight like devils mrs * johnson is here a regular heroine she * the governor of north carolina in some way and has got arms and clothes and ammunition for her husbands regiment there was some joke the regimental breeches were all wrong but a tailor * * part before or something odd captain hartstein came today with mrs bartow colonel bartow is colonel of a georgia regiment now in virginia he was the mayor of savannah who helped to wake the patriotic echoes the livelong night under my sleepless head into the small hours in charleston in november last his wife is a charming person witty and wise daughter of judge berrien she had on a white muslin apron with pink bows on the pockets it gave her a gay and girlish air and yet she must be as old as i am mr lamar who does not love slavery more than sumner does nor than i do laughs at the compliment new england pays us we want to separate from them to be rid of the yankees forever at any price and they hate us so and would clasp us or grapple us as * has it to their bosoms with * of steel we are an unwilling bride i think incompatibility of temper began when it was made plain to us that we got all the * of slavery and they all the money there was in it with their tariff mr lamar says the young men are lighthearted because there is a fight on hand but those few who look ahead the clear heads they see all the risk the loss of land limb and life home wife and children as in the brave days of old they take to it for their countrys sake they are ready and willing come what may but not so lighthearted as the * * mrs preston mrs wigfall mary hammy and i drove in a fine open carriage to see the * de mars it was a grand tableau out there mr davis rode a beautiful gray horse the arab edwin de leon brought him from egypt his worst enemy will allow that he is a consummate rider graceful and easy in the saddle and mr chesnut who has talked horse with his father ever since he was born owns that mr davis knows more about horses than any man he has met yet general lee was there with him also joe davis and wigfall acting as his aides poor mr lamar has been brought from his * or some sort of shock every woman in the house is ready to rush into the florence nightingale business i think i will wait for a wounded man to make my first effort as sister of charity mr lamar sent for me as everybody went mr davis setting the example so did i lamar will not die this time will men flatter and make eyes until their eyes close in death at the ministering angels he was the same old lamar of the drawingroom it is pleasant at the presidents table my seat is next to joe davis with mr browne on the other side and mr mallory opposite there is great constraint however as soon as i came i repeated what the north carolina man said on the cars that north carolina had 20000 men ready and they were kept back by mr walker etc the president caught something of what i was saying and asked me to repeat it which i did although i was scared to death madame when you see that person tell him his statement is false we are too anxious here for troops to refuse a man who offers himself not to speak of 20000 men silence * the most profound uncle h gave me three hundred dollars for his daughter marys expenses making four in all that i have of hers he would pay me one hundred which he said he owed my husband for a horse i thought it an excuse to lend me money i told him i had enough and to spare for all my needs until my colonel came home from the wars ben allston the governors son is * to see me does not show much of the wit of the * pleasant person however mr brewster and wigfall came at the same time the former chafing at wigfalls anomalous position here gave him fiery advice mr wigfall was calm and full of common sense a brave man and without a thought of any necessity for displaying his temper he said brewster at this time before the country is strong and settled in her new career it would be disastrous for us the head men to engage in a row among ourselves as i was * flies away and fanning the prostrate lamar i reported mr daviss conversation of the night before he is all right said mr lamar the fight had to come we are men not women the quarrel had lasted long enough we hate each other so the fight had to come even * heroes after they had stormed and scolded enough fought like brave men long and well if the athlete sumner had stood on his manhood and training and struck back when preston brooks assailed him preston * blow need not have been the opening skirmish of the war sumners country took up the fight because he did not sumner chose his own battlefield and it was the worse for us what an awful blunder that preston brooks business was lamar said yankees did not fight for the fun of it they always made it pay or let it alone met mr lyon with news * man here in the midst of us taken with lincolns passports etc in his * palpable spy mr lyon said he would be * all human probability that is a letter from my husband written at camp pickens and saying if you and mrs preston can make up your minds to leave richmond and can come up to a nice little country house near orange court house we could come to see you frequently while the army is stationed here it would be a safe place for the present near the scene of action and directly in the line of news from all sides so we go to orange court house read the story of * the * man he has wonderful interest just now slavery has to go of course and joy go with it these yankees may kill us and lay waste our land for a while but conquer * russell abuses us in his letters people here care a great deal for what russell says because he represents the london times and the times reflects the sentiment of the english people how we do cling to the idea of an alliance with england or france without france even washington could not have done it we drove to the camp to see the president present a flag to a maryland regiment having lived on the battlefield * near camden we have an immense respect for the maryland line when our militia in that fight ran away colonel howard and the marylanders held their own against * cornwallis and the rest and everywhere around are places named for a * captain killed in our * de * etc the last however was a prussian count a letter from my husband written june 22d has just reached me he says we are very strongly posted entrenched and have now at our command about # of the best troops in the world we have besides two batteries of artillery a regiment of cavalry and daily expect a battalion of flying artillery from richmond we have sent forward seven regiments of infantry and rifles toward alexandria our outposts have felt the enemy several times and in every instance the enemy * general johnston has had several * advancing columns of the two * with him too the enemy although always superior in numbers are invariably driven back there is great deficiency in the matter of ammunition general johnstons command in the very face of overwhelming numbers have only thirty rounds each if they had been well provided in this respect they could and would have defeated * and * with great ease i find the opinion prevails throughout the army that there is great imbecility and shameful neglect in the war department unless the republicans fall back we must soon come together on both lines and have a decided engagement but the opinion prevails here that lincolns army will not meet us if they can avoid it they have already fallen back before a slight check from # of johnstons men they had # and were badly beaten you have no idea how dirty and irksome the camp life is you would hardly know your best friend in camp guise noise of drums tramp of marching regiments all day long rattling of artillery wagons bands of music friends from every quarter coming in we ought to be miserable and anxious and yet these are pleasant days perhaps we are unnaturally * and excited heard some people in the drawingroom say mrs daviss ladies are not young are not pretty and i am one of them the truthfulness of the remark did not tend to alleviate its bitterness we must put maggie howell and mary hammy in the foreground as youth and beauty are in request at least they are young * spots in a * picture the president does not forbid our going but he is very much averse to it we are consequently frightened by our own audacity but we are wilful women and so we go * white sulphur springs va july 6 #* brewster came here with us the cars were * with soldiers to the muzzle they were very polite and considerate and we had an agreeable journey in spite of heat dust and crowd rev robert barnwell was with us he means to organize a hospital for sick and wounded there was not an inch of * even so dusty so close but everybody in * spirits mr preston and mr chesnut met us at warrenton saw across the lawn but did not speak to them some of judge campbells family there they wander disconsolate just outside the gates of their paradise a resigned judge of the supreme court of the united states resigned and for a cause that he is hardly more than half in sympathy with judge campbells is one of the hardest cases this water is making us young again how these men enjoy the baths they say beauregard can stop the way with sixty thousand that many are coming an antique female with every hair curled and * said to be a yankee spy sits opposite us brewster solemnly wondered with eternity and the judgment to come so near at hand how she could waste her few remaining minutes curling her hair he bade me be very polite for she would ask me questions when we were walking away from table i demanded his approval of my selfcontrol under such trying circumstances it seems i was not as calm and forbearing as i thought myself brewster answered with emphasis do you always carry * like that in your pocket ready for the first word that * you you must not do so when you are with spies from the other side i do not feel at all afraid of spies hearing anything through me for i do not know anything but our men could not tarry with us in these cool shades and comfortable quarters with water unlimited excellent table etc they have gone back to manassas and the faithful brewster with them to bring us the latest news they left us in excellent spirits which we shared until they were out of sight we went with them to warrenton and then heard that general johnston was in full retreat and that a column was advancing upon beauregard so we came back all forlorn if our husbands are taken prisoners what will they do with them are they soldiers or traitors mrs ould read us a letter from richmond how horrified they are there at joe johnstons retreating and the enemies of the war department accuse walker of not sending general johnston ammunition in sufficient quantities say that is the real cause of his retreat now will they not make the ears of that * the secretary of war * mrs prestons maid maria has a way of rushing * you hear the cannon we fly to the windows lean out to our waists pull all the hair away from our ears but can not hear it lincoln wants four hundred millions of money and men in proportion can he get them he will find us a heavy handful midnight i hear marias guns we are always picking up some good thing of the rough * saying lincoln objects to some * he is too * that is a horrid style of man or woman the interruptions i know the thing but had no name for it before our battle summer may it be our first and our last so called after all we have not had any of the horrors of war could there have been a gayer or pleasanter life than we led in charleston and montgomery how exciting it all was there so many clever men and women congregated from every part of the south mosquitoes and a want of neatness and a want of good things to eat drove us away in richmond the girls say it is perfectly delightful we found it so too but the * and quarreling have begun there at table today we heard mrs daviss ladies described they were said to wear red frocks and flats on their heads we sat mute as mice one woman said she found the drawingroom of the spotswood was warm stuffy and stifling poor soul murmured the inevitable brewster and no man came to air her in the moonlight stroll you know why didnt somebody ask her out on the piazza to see the comet heavens above what * was done in the name of the comet when you stumbled on a couple on the piazza they lifted their eyes and comet was the only word you heard brewster came back with a paper from washington with terrific threats of what they will do to us threatened men live long there was a soft sweet low and slow young lady opposite to us she seemed so gentle and refined and so uncertain of everything mr brewster called her miss * * who always asked her maid when a new book was mentioned * have i perused that volume mary hammy having a fianc in the wars is inclined at times to be sad and tearful mrs preston quoted her negro nurse to her never take any more trouble in your heart than you can kick off at the end of your toes we did hear cannon today the woman who slandered mrs daviss republican court of which we are honorable members by saying * were not young that they wore gaudy colors and dressed * took an inventory today as to her charms she is darkly deeply beautifully freckled she wears a wig which is kept in place by a tiara of mock jewels she has the * of arms and wears black * bracelets the one who is under a cloud shadowed as a yankee spy has confirmed our worst suspicions she exhibited unholy joy as she reported seven hundred sick soldiers in the hospital at culpeper and that beauregard had sent a flag of truce to washington what a night we had maria had seen suspicious persons hovering about all day and mrs preston a ladder which could easily be placed so as to reach our rooms mary hammy saw lights glancing about among the trees and we all heard guns so we sat up consequently i am writing in bed today a letter from my husband saying in particular our orders are to move on the date july 10th here we are still and no more prospect of movement now than when i last wrote to you it is true however that the enemy is advancing slowly in our front and we are preparing to receive him he comes in great force being more than three times our number the spy socalled gave us a parting shot said beauregard had arrested her brother in order that he might take a fine horse which the aforesaid brother was riding why beauregard at a moments notice could have any horse in south carolina or louisiana for that matter this man was arrested and sent to richmond and will be acquitted as they always are said brewster they send them first to richmond to see and hear everything there then they acquit them and send them out of the country by way of norfolk to see everything there but after all what does it matter they have no need for spies our newspapers keep no secrets hid the thoughts of our hearts are all revealed everything with us is open and * at bethel the yankees fired too high every daily paper is * them about it yet theyll fire low enough next time but no newspaper man will be there to get the benefit of their improved practise alas ichmond va july 13 #* we feel safe and comfortable we can not be flanked mr preston met us at warrenton mr chesnut doubtless had too many spies to receive from washington galloping in with the exact numbers of the enemy done up in their back hair wade hampton is here doctor * * and * known to fame everybody is here en route for the army or staying for the meeting of congress lamar is out on crutches his fatherinlaw once known only as the humorist longstreet author of georgia scenes now a staid methodist who has * the follies of his youth bore him off today they say judge longstreet has lost the keen sense of fun that illuminated his life in days of yore mrs lamar and her daughter were here the president met us cordially but he laughed at our sudden retreat with baggage lost etc he tried to keep us from going said it was a dangerous experiment dare say he knows more about the situation of things than he chooses to tell us today in the drawingroom saw a * in the flesh she was in the uniform of her regiment but wore turkish pantaloons she * about in her hat and feathers did not uncover her head as a man would have done played the piano and sang * she had no drum but she gave us * she was followed at every step by a mob of admiring soldiers and boys yesterday as we left the cars we had a glimpse of war it was the saddest sight the memory of it is hard to shake * soldiers not wounded ones there were quite two hundred they said lying about as best they might on the platform robert barnwell was there doing all he could their pale ghastly faces so here is one of the horrors of war we had not reckoned on there were many good men and women with robert barnwell rendering all the service possible in the circumstances just now i happened to look up and saw mr chesnut with a smile on his face watching me from the passageway i flew across the room and as i got halfway saw mrs davis touch him on the shoulder she said he was to go at once into mr daviss room where general lee and general cooper were after he left us mrs davis told me general beauregard had sent mr chesnut here on some army business mr chesnut remained * with the president and general lee all the afternoon the news does not seem pleasant at least he is not inclined to tell me any of it he satisfied himself with telling me how sensible and soldierly this handsome general lee is general lees military sagacity was also his theme of course the president dominated the party as well by his weight of brain as by his position i did not care a fig for a description of the war council i wanted to know what is in the wind now dined today at the presidents table joe davis the nephew asked me if i liked white port wine i said i did not know all that i had ever known had been dark red so he poured me out a glass i drank it and it nearly burned up my mouth and throat it was horrid but i did not let him see how it annoyed me i pretended to be glad that any one found me still young enough to play off a practical joke upon me it was thirty years since i had thought of such a thing met colonel * in the drawingroom he pointed significantly to his confederate colonels buttons and gray coat at the white sulphur last summer he was a union man to the last point how much have you changed besides your coat i was always true to our country he said she leaves me no choice now as far as i can make out beauregard sent mr chesnut to the president to gain permission for the forces of joe johnston and beauregard to join and united to push the enemy if possible over the potomac now every day we grow weaker and they stronger so we had better give a telling blow at once already we begin to cry out for more ammunition and already the blockade is beginning to shut it all out a young emory is here his mother writes him to go back her franklin blood certainly calls him with no uncertain sound to the northern side while his fatherland is wavering and undecided split in half by factions mrs wigfall says he is half inclined to go she wondered that he did not with a father in the enemys army he will always be suspect here let the president and mrs davis do for him what they will i did not know there was such a bitter cry left in me but i wept my heart away today when my husband went off things do look so black when he comes up here he rarely brings his bodyservant a negro man lawrence has charge of all mr chesnuts * clothes and two or three hundred gold pieces that lie in the tray of his trunk all these papers etc he tells lawrence to bring to me if anything happens to him but i said maybe he will pack off to the yankees and freedom with all that * he is not going to leave me for anybody else after all what can he ever be better than he is * gentlemans gentleman he is within sound of the enemys guns and when he gets to the other army he is free maria said of mr prestons man what he want with anything more ef he was free dont he live just as well as mars john do now mrs mclane mrs joe johnston mrs wigfall all came i am sure so many clever women could divert a soul in * the hampton legion all in a * i forget what standing on their dignity i suppose i have come to detest a man who says my own personal dignity and selfrespect require i long to cry no need to respect yourself until you can make other people do it beauregard telegraphed yesterday they say to general johnston come down and help us or we shall be crushed by numbers the president telegraphed general johnston to move down to beauregards aid at bull run bonhams brigade ewells and longstreets encountered the foe and repulsed him six hundred prisoners have been sent here i arose as the scriptures say and washed my face and * my head and went downstairs at the foot of them stood general cooper radiant one finger nervously arranging his shirt collar or adjusting his neck to it after his fashion he called out your south carolina man bonham has done a capital thing at bull * back the enemy if not defeated him with killed and prisoners etc etc clingman came to tell the particulars and colonel smith one of the trio with garnett mcclellan who were sent to europe to inspect and report on military matters poor garnett is killed there was cowardice or treachery on the part of natives up there or some of governor letchers appointments to military posts i hear all these things said i do not understand but it was a fatal business mrs mclane says she finds we do not believe a word of any news unless it comes in this guise a great battle fought not one confederate killed enemys loss in killed wounded and prisoners taken by us immense i was in hopes there would be no battle until mr chesnut was forced to give up his amateur * to come and attend to his regular duties in the congress keitt has come in he says bonhams battle was a skirmish of outposts joe davis jr said would heaven only send us a napoleon not one bit of use if heaven did walker would not give him a commission mrs davis and mrs joe johnston her dear lydia were in fine spirits the effect upon nous * was evident we rallied visibly south carolina troops pass every day they go by with a gay step tom taylor and john rhett bowed to us from their horses as we leaned out of the windows such shaking of handkerchiefs we are forever at the windows it was not such a mere skirmish we took three rifled cannon and six hundred stands of arms mr davis has gone to manassas he did not let wigfall know he was going that ends the delusion of wigfalls * no mistake today i was too ill to move out of my bed so they all sat in my room mrs davis came in so softly that i did not know she was here until she leaned over me and said a great battle has been fought joe johnston led the right wing and beauregard the left wing of the army your husband is all right wade hampton is wounded colonel johnston of the legion killed so are colonel bee and colonel bartow kirby smith is wounded or killed i had no breath to speak she went on in that desperate calm way to which people * themselves under the greatest excitement bartow rallying his men leading them into the hottest of the fight died gallantly at the head of his regiment the president telegraphs me only that it is a great victory general cooper has all the other telegrams still i said nothing i was stunned then i was so grateful those nearest and dearest to me were safe still she then began in the same concentrated voice to read from a paper she held in her hand dead and dying cover the field shermans battery taken lynchburg regiment cut to pieces three hundred of the legion wounded that got me up times were too wild with excitement to stay in bed we went into mrs prestons room and she made me lie down on her bed men women and children streamed in every living soul had a story to tell complete victory you heard everywhere we had been such anxious wretches the revulsion of feeling was almost too much to bear today i met my friend mr hunter i was on my way to mrs bartows room and begged him to call at some other time i was too tearful just then for a morning visit from even the most sympathetic person a woman from mrs bartows country was in a fury because they had stopped her as she rushed to be the first to tell mrs bartow her husband was killed it having been decided that mrs davis should tell her poor thing she was found lying on her bed when mrs davis knocked come in she said when she saw it was mrs davis she sat up ready to spring to her feet but then there was something in mrs daviss pale face that took the life out of her she stared at mrs davis then sank back and covered her face as she asked is it bad news for me mrs davis did not speak is he killed afterward mrs bartow said to me as soon as i saw mrs daviss face i could not say one word i knew it all in an instant i knew it before i wrapped the shawl about my head maria mrs prestons maid furiously patriotic came into my room these colored people say it is printed in the papers here that the virginia people done it all now mars wade had so many of his men killed and he wounded it stands to reason that south carolina was no ways backward if there was ever anything plain thats plain * for the first time a military funeral as that march came wailing up they say mrs bartow fainted the empty saddle and the led * saw and heard it all and now it seems we are never out of the sound of the dead march in saul it comes and it comes until i feel inclined to close my ears and scream yesterday mrs singleton and ourselves sat on a bedside and mingled our tears for those noble * darby theodore barker and james lowndes today we find we wasted our grief they are not so much as wounded i dare say all the rest is true about * the face of the enemy with flags in their hands leading their men but dr darby is a surgeon he is as likely to forget that as i am he is grandson of colonel * of the revolution called by way of pet name by his soldiers old danger thank heaven they are all quite alive and we will not cry next time until officially notified here mr chesnut opened my door and walked in out of the fulness of the heart the mouth * i had to ask no questions he gave me an account of the battle as he saw it walking up and down my room occasionally seating himself on a window sill but too restless to remain still many moments and told what regiments he was sent to bring up he took the orders to colonel jackson whose regiment stood so stock still under fire that they were called a stone wall also they call beauregard eugene and johnston * mr chesnut rode with * cavalry after the retreating enemy in the pursuit they following them until midnight then there came such a fall of * such as is only known in * lands in the drawingroom colonel chesnut was the belle of the ball they crowded him so for news he was the first arrival that they could get at from the field of battle but the women had to give way to the dignitaries of the land who were as filled with curiosity as * barnwell mr hunter mr cobb captain ingraham etc wilmot de saussure says wilson of massachusetts a senator of the united states came to manassas en route to richmond with his dancing shoes ready for a festive scene which was to celebrate a triumph the new york tribune said in a few days we shall have richmond memphis and new orleans they must be taken and at once for a few days maybe now they will modestly substitute in a few years they brought me a yankee soldiers portfolio from the battlefield the letters had been * by senator * one might shed tears over some of the letters women wives and mothers are the same everywhere what a comfort the spelling was we had been willing to admit that their universal * education had put them rank and file ahead of us * but these letters do not attest that fact the spelling is * bad mrs daviss drawingroom last night was brilliant and she was in great force outside a mob called for the president he did * old warhorse who * the battlefields from afar his enthusiasm was contagious they called for colonel chesnut and he gave them a capital speech too as public speakers say sometimes it was the proudest moment of my life i did not hear a great deal of it for always when anything happens of any moment my heart beats up in my ears but the distinguished carolinians who crowded round told me how good a speech he made i was dazed there goes the dead march for some poor soul today the president told us at dinner that mr chesnuts eulogy of bartow in the congress was highly praised men liked it two eminently satisfactory speeches in twentyfour hours is doing pretty well and now i could be happy but this cabinet of ours are in such bitter quarrels among * abusing everybody last night while those splendid descriptions of the battle were being given to the crowd below from our windows i said then why do we not go on to washington you mean why did they not the opportunity is lost mr barnwell said to me silence we want to listen to the speaker and mr hunter smiled * dont ask awkward questions kirby smith came down on the turnpike in the very nick of time still the heroes who fought all day and held the yankees in check deserve credit beyond words or it would all have been over before the joe johnston contingent came it is another case of the eleventhhour scrape the eleventhhour men claim all the credit and they who bore the heat and brunt and burden of the day do not like that everybody said at first pshaw there will be no war those who foresaw evil were called ravens * now the same sanguine people all cry the war is * very same who were packing to leave richmond a few days ago many were ready to move on at a moments warning when the good news came there are such owls everywhere but to revert to the other kind the sage and circumspect those who say very little but that little shows they think the war barely begun mr rives and mr seddon have just called * van * * came to see me at the same time he said there was no great show of victory on our side until two oclock but when we began to win we did it in doublequick time i mean of course the battle last sunday arnold harris told mr wigfall the news from washington last sunday for hours the telegrams reported at rapid intervals great victory defeating them at all points the couriers began to come in on horseback and at last after two or three oclock there was a sudden cessation of all news about nine messengers with * came on foot or on * weary * footsore * in their path on every hand terror and dismay that was our opportunity wigfall can see nothing that could have stopped us and when they explain why we did not go to washington i understand it all less than ever yet here we will * and congress * and generals parade until they in the north get up an army three times as large as mcdowells which we have just defeated trescott says this victory will be our ruin it * us into a fools paradise of conceit at our superior valor and the shameful farce of their flight will wake every inch of their manhood it was the very * they needed there are a * sort here who know their yankees well they say if the thing begins to * contracts and all * will never hear the end of it at least until they get their pay in some way out of us they will not lose money by us of that we may be sure trust yankee * and * for that there seems to be a battle raging at bethel but no mortal here can be got to think of anything but manassas mrs mclean says she does not see that it was such a great victory and if it be so great how can one defeat hurt a nation like the north john * fought the whole battle over for me now i understand it before this nobody would take the time to tell the thing * * and in order mr venable said he did not see a braver thing done than the cool performance of a columbia negro he carried his master a bucket of ham and rice which he had cooked for him and he cried you must be so tired and hungry marster make haste and eat this was in the thickest of the fight under the heaviest of the enemys guns the federal congressmen had been making a picnic of it their luggage was all * to richmond cameron has issued a proclamation they are making ready to come after us on a magnificent scale they acknowledge us at last * worthy of their steel the lord help us since england and france wont or dont if we could only get a friend outside and open a port one of these men told me he had seen a yankee prisoner who asked him what sort of a * richmond was for trade he was tired of the old concern and would like to take the oath and settle here they brought us * found in the * of the yankee army for whom were they jeff davis no doubt and the * tell that to the marines we have * the * business on this side of the water dr gibbes says he was at a country house near manassas when a federal soldier who had lost his way came in exhausted he asked for brandy which the lady of the house gave him upon second thought he declined it she brought it to him so promptly he said he thought it might be poisoned his mind was she was enraged and said sir i am a virginia woman do you think i could be as base as that here bill tom disarm this man he is our prisoner the negroes came running and the man surrendered without more * another federal was drinking at the well a negro girl said you go in and see missis the man went in and she followed crying triumphantly look here missis i got a prisoner too this lady sent in her two prisoners and beauregard complimented her on her pluck and patriotism and her presence of mind these negroes were rewarded by their owners now if slavery is as disagreeable to negroes as we think it why dont they all march over the border where they would be received with open arms it all * me i am always studying these creatures they are to me inscrutable in their way and past finding out our negroes were not ripe for john brown this is how i saw robert e lee for the first time though his family then living at arlington called to see me while i was in washington i thought because of old colonel chesnuts intimacy with nellie custis in the old philadelphia days mrs lee being * custiss niece i had not known the head of the lee family he was somewhere with the army then last summer at the white sulphur were roony lee and his wife that sweet little charlotte * and i spoke of roony with great praise mrs izard said dont waste your admiration on him wait till you see his father he is the nearest to a perfect man i ever saw how in every * clever agreeable highbred now mrs stanard came for mrs preston and me to drive to the camp in an open carriage a man riding a beautiful horse joined us he wore a hat with something of a military look to it sat his horse gracefully and was so distinguished at all points that i very much regretted not catching his name as mrs stanard gave it to us he however heard ours and bowed as gracefully as he rode and the few remarks he made to each of us showed he knew all about us but mrs stanard was in ecstasies of * excitement i felt that she had * a big fish for just then they * in richmond mrs stanard accused him of being ambitious etc he remonstrated and said his tastes were of the simplest he only wanted a virginia farm no end of cream and fresh butter and fried * one fried chicken or two but unlimited fried chicken to all this light chat did we seriously * because the man and horse and everything about him were so finelooking perfection in fact no fault to be found if you hunted for it as he left us i said eagerly who is he you did not know why it was robert e lee son of light horse harry lee the first man in virginia raising her voice as she enumerated his glories all the same i like smith lee better and i like his looks too i know smith lee well can anybody say they know his brother i doubt it he looks so cold quiet and grand kirby smith is our blcher he came on the field in the nick of time as blcher at waterloo and now we are as the british who do not remember blcher it is all wellington so every individual man i see fought and won the battle from kershaw up and down all the eleventhhour men won the battle turned the tide the * * never hears * little as one hears of blcher in the english stories of waterloo mr venable was praising hugh garden and kershaws regiment generally this was delightful they are my friends and neighbors at home i showed him mary * letter and we agreed with her at the bottom of our hearts we believe every confederate soldier to be a hero sans * et sans * hope for the best today things must be on a pleasanter footing all over the world met the president in the corridor he took me by both hands have you breakfasted said he come in and breakfast with me alas i had had my breakfast at the public diningroom where i had taken my breakfast with mr chesnut mrs davis came to him while we were at table she said she had been to our rooms she wanted wigfall hunted up mr davis thought chesnut would be apt to know his whereabouts i ran to mrs wigfalls room who told me she was sure he could be found with his regiment in camp but mr chesnut had not to go to the camp for wigfall came to his wifes room while i was there mr davis and wigfall would be friends * the northern papers say we hung and quartered a zouave cut him into four pieces and that we tie prisoners to a tree and bayonet them in other words we are savages it ought to teach us not to credit what our papers say of them it is so absurd an imagination of evil we are absolutely treating their prisoners as well as our own men we are complained of for it here i am going to the hospitals for the enemys sick and wounded in order to see for myself why did we not follow the flying foe across the potomac that is the question of the hour in the drawingroom with those of us who are not contending as to who took ricketts battery allen green for one took it allen told us that finding a * with nice clean shirts he was so hot and dusty he stepped behind a tree and put on a clean yankee shirt and was more comfortable the new york tribune * the yankee * which has received a shock by saying we had 100000 men on the field at manassas we had about # effective men in all and then the tribune tries to inflame and * them against us by telling lies as to our treatment of prisoners they say when they come against us next it will be in overwhelming force i long to see russells letter to the london times about bull run and manassas it will be rich and rare in washington it is crimination and recrimination well let them abuse one another to their hearts content mrs wigfall with the lone star flag in her carriage called for me we drove to the fair grounds mrs daviss landau with her * bays rolled along in front of us the fair grounds are as covered with tents soldiers etc as ever as one regiment moves off to the army a fresh one from home comes to be mustered in and take its place the president with his aides dashed by my husband was riding with him the president presented the flag to the texans mr chesnut came to us for the flag and bore it aloft to the president we seemed to come in for part of the glory we were too far off to hear the speech but jeff davis is very good at that sort of thing and we were satisfied that it was well done heavens how that redoubtable wigfall did rush those poor texans about he * and marched them until i was weary for their sakes poor fellows it was a hot afternoon in august and the thermometer in the * mr davis uncovered to speak wigfall replied with his hat on is that military at the fair grounds today such music * and marching such cheering and flying of flags such firing of guns and all that sort of thing a gala day it was with * * feeling in the midst of it all a messenger came to tell mrs wigfall that a telegram had been received saying her children were safe across the lines in gordonsville that was something to thank god for without any doubt these two little girls came from somewhere in connecticut with mrs wigfalls * one who gave me my * the only person in the world except susan rutledge who ever seemed to think i had a soul to save now suppose seward had held louisa and fanny as hostages for louis wigfalls good behavior eh excitement number two that bold brigadier the georgia general toombs charging about too recklessly got thrown his horse dragged him up to the wheels of our carriage for a moment it was frightful down there among the horses hoofs was a face turned up toward us purple with rage his foot was still in the stirrup and he had not let go the bridle the horse was prancing over him tearing and plunging everybody was hemming him in and they seemed so slow and awkward about it we felt it an eternity looking down at him and expecting him to be killed before our very faces however he soon got it all straight and though awfully * and tumbled dusty * and flushed with * face and * hair than ever he rode off gallantly having to our admiration bravely * the recalcitrant charger now if i were to pick out the best abused one where all catch it so * i should say mr commissarygeneral northrop was the most * and * man in the confederacy he is held accountable for everything that goes wrong in the army he may not be efficient but having been a classmate and * of jeff davis at west point points the moral and * the tale i hear that alluded to oftenest of his many crimes they say beauregard writes that his army is upon the verge of starvation here every man woman and child is ready to hang to the first * anybody of whom that army complains every manassas soldier is a hero dear to our patriotic hearts put up with any neglect of the heroes of the 21st * and now they say we did not move on right after the flying foe because we had no provisions no wagons no ammunition etc rain mud and northrop where were the enemys supplies that we * so of * echo answers where where there is a will there is a way we stopped to plunder that rich convoy and somehow for a day or so everybody thought the war was over and stopped to rejoice so it appeared here all this was our dinnertable talk today mr mason dined with us and mr barnwell sits by me always the latter * me sharply but mr mason laughed at this headlong unreasonable womans harangue and female tactics and their * a freshet in the autumn does not compensate for a drought in the spring time and tide wait for no man and there was a tide in our affairs which might have led to washington and we did not take it and lost our fortune this round things which nobody could deny mcclellan virtually * the titan scott physically general scott is the largest man i ever saw mrs scott said nobody but his wife could ever know how little he was and yet they say old winfield scott could have organized an army for them if they had had patience they would not give him time prince jerome has gone to washington now the yankees so far are as little trained as we are raw troops are they as yet suppose france takes the other side and we have to meet disciplined and armed men soldiers who understand war frenchmen with all the lan we boast of ransom calhoun willie preston and doctor * boys are here these foolish rash * southern lads have been within an ace of a fight with a maryland company for their camping grounds it is much too irish to be so ready to fight anybody friend or foe men are thrilling with fiery ardor the redhot southern martial spirit is in the air these young men however were all educated abroad and it is french or german ideas that they are filled with the marylanders were as rash and reckless as the others and had their * ready for anybody to tread on * fair fashion one would think there were yankees enough and to spare for any killing to be done it began about * their horses but these quarrelsome young soldiers have lovely manners they are so sweettempered when seen here among us at the arlington a heavy heavy heart another missive from jordan querulous and faultfinding things are all * jordan had been crossed not the stream in * fair and happy land where our possessions lie they seem to feel that the war is over here except the president and mr barnwell above all that foreboding friend of mine captain ingraham he thinks it hardly begun another outburst from jordan beauregard is not seconded properly * to think that any mortal general even though he had sprung up in a month or so from captain of artillery to general could be so puffed up with vanity so blinded by any false idea of his own consequence as to write to intimate that man or men would sacrifice their country injure themselves ruin their families to spite the aforesaid general conceit and * can never reach a higher point than that and yet they give you to understand mr davis does not like beauregard in point of fact they fancy he is jealous of him and rather than beauregard shall have a showing the president who would be hanged at least if things go wrong will cripple the army to spite beauregard mr mallory says how we could laugh but you see it is no laughing matter to have our fate in the hands of such * vain army * so the amenities of life are spreading in the meantime we seem to be resting on our oars * in congress while the enterprising yankees are * their army at their leisure every day some of our regiments march away from here the town is crowded with soldiers these new ones are fairly running in fearing the war will be over before they get a sight of the fun every man from every little * wants a place in the picture * north requires # men to invade us truly we are a formidable power the herald says it is useless to move with a man less than that england has made it all up with them or rather she will not break with them jerome napoleon is in washington and not our friend doctor gibbes is a bird of ill omen today he tells me eight of our men have died at the charlottesville hospital it seems sickness is more redoubtable in an army than the enemys guns there are # there hors de combat and typhoid fever is with them they want money clothes and nurses so as i am writing right and left the letters fly calling for help from the sister societies at home good and patriotic women at home are easily stirred to their work mary hammy has many strings to her * fianc in the army and doctor berrien in town today she drove out with major smith and colonel hood yesterday custis lee was here she is a prudent little puss and needs no good advice if i were one to give it lawrence does all our shopping all his masters money has been in his hands until now i thought it injudicious when gold is at such a premium to leave it lying loose in the tray of a trunk so i have sewed it up in a belt which i can wear upon an emergency the cloth is wadded and my diamonds are there too it has strong strings and can be tied under my hoops about my waist if the worst comes to the worst as the saying is lawrence wears the same bronze mask no sign of anything he may feel or think of my latest fancy only i know he asks for twice as much money now when he goes to buy things today i saw a sword captured at manassas the man who brought the sword in the early part of the fray was taken prisoner by the yankees they stripped him possessed themselves of his * and were in the act of depriving him of his boots when the rout began and the play was reversed proceedings then took the opposite tack from a small * in the mountain has flowed the mighty stream which has made at last louis wigfall the worst enemy the president has in the congress a fact which * our affairs no little mr daviss hands ought to be strengthened he ought to be upheld a divided house must fall we all say mrs sam jones who is called * by her friends and * male and female said that mrs pickens had confided to the aforesaid jones ne taylor and so of the president taylor family and cousin of mr daviss first wife that mrs wigfall described mrs davis to mrs pickens as a coarse western woman now the fair lucy * and mrs wigfall had a quarrel of their own out in texas and though reconciled there was bitterness underneath at first mrs joe johnston called mrs davis a western belle but when the quarrel between general johnston and the president broke out mrs johnston took back the belle and substituted woman in the narrative derived from mrs jones commodore barron came with glad tidings we had taken three prizes at sea and brought them in safely one laden with molasses general toombs told us the president complimented mr chesnut when he described the battle scene to his cabinet etc general toombs is certain colonel chesnut will be made one of the new batch of brigadiers next came mr clayton who calmly informed us jeff davis would not get the vote of this congress for president so we might count him out mr * first told us how pious a christian soldier was kershaw how he prayed got up * his knees and led his men on to victory with a dash and courage equal to any old testament mighty man of war governor mannings account of prince jerome napoleon he is stout and he is not handsome neither is he young and as he reviewed our troops he was terribly * he heard him say en * of that he could testify of his own knowledge and he was told he had been heard to say with * * more than once the sight of the battlefield had made the prince seasick and he received gratefully a draft of fiery whisky * seemed deeply interested in confederate statistics and praised our * deeds to the skies it was but soldier fare our guests received though we did our best it was hard sleeping and worse eating in camp beauregard is half frenchman and speaks french like a native so one awkward mess was done away with and it was a comfort to see beauregard speak without the agony of finding words in the foreign language and forming them with damp brow into sentences a different fate befell others who spoke a little french general and mrs cooper came to see us she is mrs smith lees sister they were talking of old george * virginia a name to conjure with george mason violently opposed the extension of slavery he was a thorough aristocrat and gave as his reason for refusing the blessing of slaves to the new states southwest and northwest that vulgar new people were unworthy of so sacred a right as that of holding slaves it was not an institution intended for such people as they were mrs lee said after all what good does it do my sons that they are light horse harry lees grandsons and george masons i do not see that it helps them at all a friend in washington writes me that we might have walked into washington any day for a week after manassas such were the consternation and confusion there but the god pan was still blowing his horn in the woods now she says northern troops are literally pouring in from all quarters the horses cover acres of ground and she thinks we have lost our chance forever a man named grey the same gentleman whom secretary of war walker so astonished by greeting him with well sir and what is your business described the battle of the 21st as one succession of blunders redeemed by the indomitable courage of the twothirds who did not run away on our side doctor mason said a fugitive on the other side informed him that a million of men with the devil at their back could not have whipped the rebels at bull run thats nice there must be opposition in a free country but it is very uncomfortable united we stand divided we fall mrs davis showed us in the new york tribune an extract from an augusta georgia paper saying cobb is our man davis is at heart a * we may be flies on the wheel we know our insignificance but mrs preston and myself have entered into an agreement our oath is recorded on high we mean to stand by our president and to stop all faultfinding with the powers that be if we can and where we can be the * generals or cabinet ministers hon robert barnwell says the * influence began this opposition to jeff davis before he had time to do wrong they were offended not with him so much as with the man who was put into what they considered barnwell rhetts rightful place the latter had howled nullification and secession so long that when he found his ideas taken up by all the confederate world he felt he had a vested right to leadership jordan beauregards aide still writes to mr chesnut that the * among the raw troops in that camp is fearful everybody seems to be doing all they can think of the british sick and wounded away off in the crimea our people are only a * journey by rail from richmond with a grateful heart i record the fact of reconciliation with the wigfalls they dined at the presidents yesterday and the little wigfall girls stayed all night seward is * the * the cousin of the emperor napoleon iii and russell of the * london times last night there was a crowd of men to see us and they were so * critical i made a futile effort to record their sayings but sleep and heat overcame me today i can not remember a word one of mr masons stories relates to our sources of trustworthy information a man of very respectable appearance standing on the platform at the depot announced i am just from the seat of war out came pencil and paper from the newspaper men on the qui vive is fairfax court house burned they asked yes burned yesterday but i am just from there said another left it standing there all right an hour or so ago oh but i must do them justice to say they burned only the tavern for they did not want to tear up and burn anything else after the railroad there is no railroad at fairfax court house objected the man just from fairfax oh indeed said the * man i did not know that is that so and he coolly seated himself and began talking of something else our people are lashing themselves into a fury against the prisoners only the mob in any country would do that but i am told to be quiet decency and propriety will not be forgotten and the prisoners will be treated as prisoners of war ought to be in a civilized country mrs randolph came with her were the * rose and maria the men rave over mrs randolphs beauty called her a magnificent specimen of the finest type of darkeyed rich and glowing southern * clear brunette she is with the * lips the whitest teeth and glorious eyes there is no other word for them having given mrs randolph the prize among southern beauties mr clayton said * was the finest southern orator mr marshall and mr barnwell * they preferred william c preston mr chesnut had found colquitt the best or most effective stump orator saw henry deas * he is just from paris via new york says new york is ablaze with martial fire at no time during the * war was there ever in paris the show of soldiers preparing for the war such as he saw at new york the face of the earth seemed covered with marching regiments not more than 500 effective men are in hamptons legion but they kept the whole yankee army at bay until halfpast two then just as hampton was wounded and half his colonels shot cash and kershaw from mrs smith lee audibly how about kirby smith dashed in and not only turned the tide but would have driven the fugitives into washington but beauregard recalled them mr chesnut finds all this very amusing as he posted many of the regiments and all the time was carrying orders over the field the * in all these private memories amuse him but he smiles pleasantly and lets every man tell the tale in his own way mr barnwell says fame is an article usually home made you must create your own puffs or superintend their manufacture and you must see that the newspapers print your own military reports no one else will give you half the credit you take to yourself no one will look after your fine name before the world with the loving interest and faith you have yourself captain shannon of the * rangers called and stayed three hours has not been under fire yet but is keen to see or to hear the flashing of the guns proud of himself proud of his company but proudest of all that he has no end of the * blood of the low country in his troop he seemed to find my knitting a pair of socks a day for the soldiers droll in some way the yarn is coarse he has been so short a time from home he does not know how the poor soldiers need them he was so * flattering to my husband that i found him very pleasant company found it quite exciting to have a spy drinking his tea with * because i knew his profession i did not like his face he is said to have a scheme by which washington will fall into our hands like an * peach mr barnwell * mr chesnut to remain in the senate there are so many generals or men anxious to be he says mr chesnut can do his country most good by wise counsels where they are most needed i do not say to the contrary i dare not throw my influence on the army side for if anything happened mr miles told us last night that he had another letter from general beauregard the general wants to know if mr miles has delivered his message to colonel kershaw mr miles says he has not done so neither does he mean to do it they must settle these matters of veracity according to their own military etiquette he is a civilian once more it is a foolish * colonel kershaw ought to have reported to his commanderinchief and not made an independent report and published it he meant no harm he is not yet used to the fine ways of war the new york tribune is so unfair it began by howling to get rid of us we were so wicked now that we are so willing to leave them to their * * they cry crush our enemy or they will subjugate us the idea that we want to invade or subjugate anybody we would be only too grateful to be left alone we ask no more of gods or men went to the hospital with a carriage load of peaches and grapes made glad the hearts of some men thereby when my supplies gave out those who had none looked so wistfully as i passed out that i made a second raid on the market those eyes sunk in * depths and following me from bed to bed haunt me wilmot de saussure * my soul by an account of a recent death by drowning on the beach at sullivans island mr porcher who was trying to save his sisters life lost his own and his childs people seem to die out of the army quite as much as in it mrs randolph presided in all her beautiful majesty at an aid association the ladies were old and all wanted their own way they were * and contradictory and the blood mounted * into mrs randolphs * cheeks but she held her own with dignity and grace one of the causes of disturbance was that mrs randolph proposed to divide everything sent on equally with the yankee wounded and sick prisoners some were enthusiastic from a christian point of view some shrieked in wrath at the bare idea of putting our noble soldiers on a par with yankees living dying or dead fierce dames were some of them august severe matrons who evidently had not been accustomed to hear the other side of any question from anybody and just old enough to find the last pleasure in life to reside in * power to make their claws felt a brother of doctor garnett has come fresh and straight from * mass and says or is said to have said with all the difference there is between the two that recruiting up there is dead he came by cincinnati and * and says all the way through it was so sad mournful and quiet it looked like sunday i asked mr brewster if it were true senator toombs had turned brigadier yes soldiering is in the air every one will have a touch of it toombs could not stay in the cabinet why incompatibility of temper he rides too high a horse that is for so despotic a person as jeff davis i have tried to find out the sore but i cant mr toombs has been out with them all for months dissension will break out everything does but it takes a little time there is a perfect magazine of discord and discontent in that cabinet only wants a hand to apply the torch and up they go toombs says old memminger has his back up as high as any oh such a day since i wrote this morning i have been with mrs randolph to all the hospitals i can never again shut out of view the sights i saw there of human misery i sit thinking shut my eyes and see it all thinking yes and there is enough to think about now god knows * was the worst with long rows of ill men on cots ill of typhoid fever of every human * on * for eating and drinking wounds being dressed all the horrors to be taken in at one glance then we went to the st charles horrors upon horrors again want of organization long rows of dead and dying awful sights a boy from home had sent for me he was dying in a cot ill of fever next him a man died in convulsions as we stood there i was making arrangements with a nurse hiring him to take care of this lad but i do not remember any more for i fainted next that i knew of the doctor and mrs randolph were having me a limp rag put into a carriage at the door of the hospital fresh air i dare say brought me to as we drove home the doctor came along with us i was so upset he said look at that georgia regiment marching there look at their servants on the sidewalk i have been counting them making an estimate there is #* thousand dollars worth of negro property which can go off on its own legs to the yankees whenever it pleases daniel of the examiner was at the presidents wilmot de saussure wondered if a fellow did not feel a little queer paying his respects in person at the house of a man whom he abused daily in his newspaper a fiasco an aide engaged to two young ladies in the same house the ladies had been quarreling but became friends unexpectedly when his treachery among many other secrets was revealed under that august roof fancy the row when it all came out mr lowndes said we have already reaped one good result from the war the orators the * the furious patriots that could hardly be held down and who were so * anxious to do or die for their * had been the * of our lives now they either have not tried the battlefield at all or have * left it at their earliest convenience for very shame we are rid of them for a while i doubt it * speech is dead against us reading this does not brighten one mr barnwell says * lead to * to be always * is to be always false so both we and the yankees are unreliable as regards our own exploits how about empires were there ever more stupendous lies than the emperor napoleons mr barnwell went on people dare not tell the truth in a canvass they must conciliate their constituents now everybody in a democracy always wants an office at least everybody in richmond just now seems to want one never heeding interruptions he went on as a nation the english are the most truthful in the world and so are our country gentlemen they own their * least in some of the * where there are few whites only immense estates peopled by negroes thackeray speaks of the lies that were told on both sides in the british wars with france england kept quite alongside of her rival in that fine art england * then as fluently as russell lies about us now went to see agnes de leon my columbia school friend she is fresh from egypt and i wished to hear of the nile the * the mummies the sphinx and the pyramids but her head ran upon washington life such as we knew it and her soul was here no theme was possible but a discussion of the latest war news mr clayton assistant secretary of state says we spend two millions a week where is all that money to come from they dont want us to plant cotton but to make provisions now cotton always means money or did when there was an outlet for it and anybody to buy it where is money to come from now mr * new joke i dare say is a joe miller but mr barnwell laughed in telling it till he cried a man was fined for contempt of court and then his case coming on the judge talked such arrant nonsense and was so warped in his mind against the poor man that the fined one walked up and handed the august judge a * bill why what is that for said the judge oh i feel such a contempt of this court coming on again i came up tired to death took down my hair had it hanging over me in a crazy jane fashion and sat still hands over my head half undressed but too lazy and sleepy to move i was sitting in a rockingchair by an open window taking my ease and the cool night air when suddenly the door opened and captain walked in he was in the middle of the room before he saw his mistake he stared and was * as the novels say i dare say i looked an ancient * then with a more frantic glare he turned and fled without a word i got up and bolted the door after him and then looked in the glass and laughed myself into hysterics i shall never forget to lock the door again but it does not matter in this case i looked totally unlike the person bearing my name who covered with lace cap etc * the drawingroom i doubt if he would know me again the terror has full swing at the north now all the papers favorable to us have been suppressed how long would our mob stand a yankee paper here but newspapers against our government such as the examiner and the mercury flourish like green * a man up to the elbows in finance said today * story is all nonsense they do sometimes pay out two millions a week they paid the soldiers this week but they dont pay the soldiers every week not by a long shot cried a soldier * with a grin why do you write in your diary at all some one said to me if as you say you have to contradict every day what you wrote yesterday because i tell the tale as it is told to me i write current rumor i do not vouch for anything we went to * that very best of italian * from there we went to miss sally * hospital loaded with good things for the wounded the men under miss sallys kind care looked so clean and * one might say they were pleasant and nice to see one however was dismal in tone and aspect and he repeated at intervals with no change of words in a forlorn monotone what a hard time we have had since we left home but nobody seemed to heed his wailing and it did not impair his appetite at mrs toombss who was raging so * she will not even admit that the president is ill all humbug but what good could pretending to be ill do him that reception now was not that a humbug such a failure mrs reagan could have done better than that mrs walker is a montgomery beauty with such magnificent dresses she was an heiress and is so dissatisfied with richmond accustomed as she is to being a belle under different conditions as she is as handsome and well dressed as ever it must be the men who are all wrong did you give lawrence that * bill to go out and change it i was asked suppose he takes himself off to the yankees he would leave us with not too many * bills he is not going anywhere however i think his situation suits him that wadded belt of mine with the gold pieces quilted in has made me ashamed more than once i leave it under my pillow and my maid finds it there and hangs it over the back of a chair in evidence as i reenter the room after breakfast when i forget and leave my trunk open lawrence brings me the keys and tells me you * to do so miss mary mr chesnut leaves all his little money in his pockets and lawrence says thats why he cant let any one but himself brush mars * clothes theodore barker and james lowndes came the latter has been wretchedly treated a man said all that i wish on earth is to be at peace and on my own plantation to which mr lowndes replied quietly i wish i had a plantation to be on but just now i cant see how any one would feel justified in leaving the army mr barker was bitter against the spirit of * so rampant among us the gentleman who had been answered so completely by james lowndes said with * those women who are so frantic for their husbands to join the army would like them killed no doubt things were growing rather uncomfortable but an interruption came in the shape of a card an old classmate of mr * archer just now fresh from * his card so quickly that mr chesnut had hardly time to tell us that in princeton college they called him sally archer he was so * he entered he is goodlooking still but the service and consequent rough life have destroyed all softness and * he will never be so pretty again the north is consolidated they move as one man with no states but an army organized by the central power russell in the northern camp is cursed of yankees for that bull run letter russell in his capacity of englishman * both sides he divides us equally into north and south he prefers to attribute our victory at bull run to yankee cowardice rather than to southern courage he gives no credit to either side for good qualities we are after all mere americans everything not national is arrested it looks like the business of seward i do not know when i have seen a woman without knitting in her hand socks for the soldiers is the cry one poor man said he had dozens of socks and but one shirt he preferred more shirts and fewer stockings we make a quaint appearance with this twinkling of needles and the everlasting * dangling below they have arrested wm b reed and miss winder she boldly proclaiming herself a secessionist why should she seek a martyrs crown writing people love notoriety it is so delightful to be of enough consequence to be arrested i have often wondered if such incense was ever offered as napoleons socalled persecution and alleged jealousy of madame de * russell once more to whom london paris and india have been an everyday sight and * too streets and all how absurd for him to go on in indignation because there have been women on negro plantations who were not vestal virgins negro women get married and after marriage behave as well as other people marrying is the amusement of their lives they take life easily so do their class everywhere bad men are hated here as elsewhere i hate slavery i hate a man * say there are no more fallen women on a plantation than in london in proportion to numbers but what do you say to * a * who runs a hideous black * with its consequences under the same roof with his lovely white wife and his beautiful and accomplished daughters he holds his head high and * as the model of all human virtues to these poor women whom god and the laws have given him from the height of his awful majesty he * and thunders at them as if he never did wrong in his life fancy such a man finding his daughter reading don juan you with that * book he would say and then he would order her out of his sight you see mrs stowe did not hit the * spot she makes legree a bachelor remember george ii and his likes oh i know half a * man said to be as cruel as legree but the other half of him did not correspond he was a man of polished manners and the best husband and father and member of the church in the world can that be so yes i know it exceptional case that sort of thing always and i knew the * half of legree well he was high and mighty but the kindest creature to his slaves and the unfortunate results of his bad ways were not sold had not to jump over * they were kept in full view and provided for handsomely in his will the wife and daughters in the might of their purity and innocence are supposed never to dream of what is as plain before their eyes as the sunlight and they play their parts of unsuspecting angels to the letter they profess to adore the father as the model of all saintly goodness well yes if he is rich he is the fountain from whence all blessings flow the one i have in my * half of legree the * * so furious in temper and thundered his wrath so at the poor women they were glad to let him do as he pleased in peace if they could only escape his everlasting faultfinding and noisy * making everybody so uncomfortable * do you know any woman of this generation who would stand that sort of thing no never not for one moment the * angels were of the last century we know and we wont have it the condition of women is improving it seems women are brought up not to judge their fathers or their husbands they take them as the lord provides and are thankful if they should not go to heaven after all think what lives most women lead no heaven no purgatory * other thing never i believe in future rewards and * how about the wives of * i heard a woman say once to a friend of her husband tell it as a cruel matter of fact without bitterness without comment oh you have not seen him he has changed he has not gone to bed sober in thirty years she has had her purgatory if not the other thing here in this world we all know what a drunken man is to think for no crime a person may be condemned to live with one thirty years you wander from the question i asked are southern men worse because of the slave system and the facile black women not a bit they see too much of them the * people dont drink the * people * candy they are sick of the black sight of them you think a nice man from the south is the nicest thing in the world i know it put him by any other man and see have seen yankee letters taken at manassas the spelling is often atrocious and we thought they had all gone through a course of * noah webster * our soldiers do spell astonishingly there is horace greeley they say he cant read his own handwriting but he is candid enough and * all * he says in his paper that in our army the north has a hard nut to crack and that the rank and file of our army is superior in education and general intelligence to theirs my wildest imagination will not picture mr mason as a diplomat he will say * for chew and he will call himself jeems and he will wear a dress coat to breakfast over here whatever a mason does is right in his own eyes he is above law somebody asked him how he pronounced his wifes maiden name she was a miss chew from philadelphia they say the english will like mr mason he is so manly so straightforward so truthful and bold a fine old english gentleman so said russell to me but for tobacco i like mr mason and mr hunter better than anybody else and yet they are wonderfully unlike now you just listen to me said i is mrs davis in * well this sending mr mason to london is the maddest thing yet worse in some points of view than yancey and that was a catastrophe no more feminine gossip but the * * the mighty russell of the times he says the battle of the 21st was fought at long range 500 yards apart were the combatants the confederates were steadily retreating when some commotion in the wagon train frightened the yanks and they made tracks in good english they fled * and on our side we were too frightened to follow * * english to pursue the flying foe in spite of all this there are glimpses of the truth sometimes and the story leads to our credit with all the sneers and jeers when he speaks of the yankees cowardice falsehood * and * the best words are in his mouth he repeats the * tale so often refuted and denied that we were harsh to wounded prisoners dr gibson told me that their surgeongeneral has written to thank our surgeons yankee officers write very differently from russell i know that in that hospital with the sisters of charity they were better off than our men were at the other hospitals that i saw with my own eyes these poor souls are jealously guarded night and day it is a hideous * they tell of their sufferings women who come before the public are in a bad box now false hair is taken off and searched for papers * are suspect all manner of things they say come over the border under the huge hoops now worn so they are ruthlessly torn off not legs but arms are looked for under hoops and sad to say found then women are used as detectives and * to see that no men slip over in petticoats so the poor creatures coming this way are humiliated to the deepest degree to men glory honor praise and power if they are patriots to women daughters of eve punishment comes still in some shape do what they will mary * eyes were starting from her head with amazement while a very large and handsome south carolinian talked rapidly what is it asked i after he had gone oh what a year can bring * year last summer you remember how he swore he was in love with me he told you he told me he told everybody and if i did refuse to marry him i believed him now he says he has seen fallen in love with courted and married another person and he raves of his little daughters beauty and they say time goes * spoke mary hammy with a sigh of wonder at his wonderful cure time works wonders said the * what conclusion did you come to as to southern men at the grand powwow you know they are nicer than the * gentlemen you know there are not too many of that kind anywhere ours are generous truthful brave * to us you know a southern husband is not a bad thing to have about the house mrs frank hampton said for one thing you could not flirt with these south carolinians they would not stay at the * degree of flirtation they grow so * in earnest before you know where you are do you think two married people ever lived together without finding each other out i mean knowing exactly how good or how shabby how weak or how strong above all how selfish each was yes unless they are * they know to a * but you see if they have common sense they make believe and get on so so like the * * wine in old curiosity shop a violent attack upon the north today in the * they mean to let freedom slide a while until they subjugate us the * says they use * de cachet passports and all the despotic apparatus of regal governments russell hears the tramp of the coming * king and * tyrant that is to rule them is it * mac we may tremble when he comes we down here have only the * monster thing armed democracy our chiefs quarrel among themselves mcclellan is of a forgiving spirit he does not resent russells * upon yankees but with good policy has russell with him as a guest the adonis of an aide * as one who knows that sumter andersons heart is with us that he will not fight the south after all is said and done that sounds like nonsense sumter andersons wife was a daughter of governor clinch of georgia does that explain it he also told me something of garnett who was killed at rich mountain he had been an unlucky man clear through in the army before the war the aide had found him proud reserved and morose cold as an * to all but for his wife and child he was a different creature he adored them and cared for nothing else one day he went off on an expedition and was gone six weeks he was out in the northwest and the indians were troublesome when he came back his wife and child were underground he said not one word but they found him more frozen stern and isolated than ever that was all the night before he left richmond he said in his quiet way they have not given me an adequate force i can do nothing they have sent me to my death it is acknowledged that he threw away his * * man said the aide and the * on the front steps every evening we take our seats and discourse at our pleasure a nicer or more agreeable set of people were never assembled than our present arlington crowd tonight it was yancey who occupied our tongues send a man to england who had killed his fatherinlaw in a street * that was not knowing england or englishmen surely who wants eloquence we want somebody who can hold his tongue people avoid great talkers men who * men given to monologue as they would avoid fire famine or pestilence yancey will have no mobs to harangue no stump speeches will be possible superb as are his of their kind but little quiet conversation is best with slow solid * people who begin to suspect as soon as any flourish of trumpets meets their ear if yancey should use his fine words who would care for them over there commodore barron when he was a * accompanied * augustus stockton to claim his bride he the said stockton had secretly wedded a fair heiress sally cantey she was married by a magistrate and returned to mrs * boardingschool until it was time to go * is to camden lieutenant stockton a descendant of the * was the handsomest man in the navy and

the guardians commodore barron said he anticipated a rough job of it all but they were prepared for all risks you expected to find us a horde of savages no doubt said i we did not expect to get off under a halfdozen duels they looked for insults from every quarter and they found a polished and refined people who lived en prince to say the least of it they were received with a cold stately and faultless politeness which made them feel as if they had been * the young lady had confessed to her guardians and they were for making the best of it above all for saving her name from all gossip or publicity colonel john boykin one of them took young * to stay with him his friend barron was also a guest colonel deas sent for a parson and made assurance doubly sure by marrying them over again their wish was to keep things quiet and not to make a * wonder of the young lady then came balls parties and festivities without end he was enchanted with the * life of these people with dinners the finest in the world * and * dancing and pretty girls in fact everything that heart could wish but then said commodore barron the better it was and the kinder the treatment the more ashamed i grew of my business down there after all it was stealing an heiress you know i told him how the same fate still haunted that estate in camden mr stockton sold it to a gentleman who later sold it to an old man who had married when near eighty and who left it to the daughter born of that marriage this pretty child of his old age was left an orphan quite young at the age of fifteen she ran away and married a boy of seventeen a * * the young couple lived to grow up and it proved after all a happy marriage this last heiress left six children so the estate will now be divided and no longer tempt the * the

i should spoil all by repeating what she says it is your own family that she calls the * of the inquisition she declares that they set upon you fall foul of you watch and harass you from morn till dewy eve they have a perfect right to your life night and day unto the fourth and fifth generation they drop in at breakfast and say are you not imprudent to eat that take care now dont * it i think you eat too much so early in the day and they help themselves to the only thing you care for on the table they abuse your friends and tell you it is your duty to praise your enemies they tell you of all your faults candidly because they love you so that gives them a right to speak what family interest they take in you you ought to do this you ought to do that and then the everlasting you ought to

really respectable responsible revered and beloved head of a family who ever opened his mouth at home except to find fault he really thinks that is his business in life and that all enjoyment is sinful he is there to prevent the women from such frivolous things as pleasure etc etc i sat placidly rocking in my chair by the window trying to hope all was for the best mary hammy rushed in

and he loudly declares that he hates to see persons ill seems to him an unpardonable weakness it began to grow late many people had come to say goodby to me i had fever as usual today but in the excitement of this crowd of friends the invalid forgot fever mr chesnut held up his watch to me * and intimated it was late indeed for one who has to travel tomorrow so as the yankees say after every defeat i retired in good order not quite for i forgot handkerchief and fan gonzales rushed after and met me at the foot of the stairs in his foreign pathetic polite highbred way he bowed low and said he had made an excuse for the fan for he had a present to make me and then though startled and amazed i paused and on the stranger gazed alas i am a woman approaching forty and the offering proved to be a bottle of cherry * nothing could have been more opportune and with a little ice etc will help i am sure to save my life on that dreadful journey home no discouragement now felt at the north they take our forts and are satisfied for a while then the english are strictly neutral like the woman who saw her husband fight the bear it was the first fight she ever saw when she did not care who whipped mr davis was very kind about it all he told mr chesnut to go home and have an eye to all the state defenses etc and that he would give him any position he asked for if he still wished to continue in the army now this would be all that heart could wish but mr chesnut will never ask for anything what will he ask for thats the rub i am certain of very few things in life now but this is one i am certain of mr chesnut will never ask mortal man for any promotion for himself or for one of his own family amden s c september 9 #* again at mulberry the fever in full possession of me my

so they said when mrs john n williams died so uncle john said yesterday of his brother burwell death deserts the army said that quaint old soul and takes fancy shots of the most eccentric kind nearer home the high and disinterested conduct our enemies seem to expect of us is involuntary and unconscious praise they pay us the compliment to look for from us and * us for the want of it a degree of

not pay to own them themselves gradually they slid or sold them off down here or freed them * giving themselves years in which to get rid of them in a remunerative way we want to spread them over other lands * and south or northwest where the climate would free them or kill them or improve them out of the world as our friends up north do the indians if they had been forced to keep the negroes in new england i dare say the negroes might have shared the indians fate for they are wise in their generation these yankee children of light those pernicious africans so have just spoken mr chesnut and uncle john both cidevant union men now utterly for state rights it is queer how different the same man may appear viewed from different * what a perfect gentleman said one person of another so finelooking highbred distinguished easy free and above all graceful in his bearing so * he is always indignant at any symptom of * he is * man of all others i like to have strangers * noble representative of our country yes every word of that is true was the reply he is all that and then the other side of the picture is true too you can always find him you know where to find him wherever there is a * a bottle or a woman there will he be also my god and you call yourself his friend yes i know him down to the ground this conversation i overheard from an upper window when looking down on

be * as keitt says they lost six thousand we two thousand i grudge that proportion in vain alas ye gallant * but undismayed again they make a stand we have buckner beauregard and albert sidney johnston with such leaders and gods help we may be saved from the hated yankees who knows a crowd collected here last night and there was a serenade i am like mrs * who never saw a horse coming full speed but she thought the * had sent posthaste to take nicholas into copartnership so i got up and dressed late as it was i felt sure england had sought our alliance at last and we would make a yorktown of it before long who was it will you ever * goodwyn and general owens of florida just then mr chesnut rushed in put out the light locked the door and sat still as a mouse rap rap came at the door i say chesnut they are calling for you at last we heard janney * loudly proclaiming from the piazza that colonel chesnut was not here at all at all after a while when they had all gone from the street and the very house itself had subsided into perfect quiet the door again was roughly shaken i say chesnut old fellow come * know you are there nobody here now wants to hear you make a speech that crowd has all gone we want a little quiet talk with you i am just from richmond that was the open sesame and today i hear none of the richmond news is encouraging colonel shaw is blamed for the shameful roanoke surrender toombs is out on a * and swears he will not accept a seat in the confederate senate given in the insulting way his was by the georgia legislature calls it shabby treatment and adds that georgia is not the only place where good men have been so ill used the governor and council have fluttered the * or at least the * they talk of making a call for all silver etc i doubt if we have enough to make the sacrifice worth while but we propose to set the example what a beautiful day for our confederate president to be inaugurated god speed him god keep him god save him john chesnuts letter was quite what we needed in spirit it is all that one could ask he says our late reverses are acting finely with the army of the potomac a few more * and every man will enlist for the war victories made us too sanguine and easy not to say * now for the rub and let them have it a lady wrote to mrs bunch dear emma when shall i call for you to go and see madame de st * she was answered dear lou i can not go with you to see madame de st * but will always retain the kindest feeling toward you on account of our past relations etc the astounded friend wrote to ask what all this meant no answer came and then she sent her husband to ask and demand an explanation he was answered thus my dear fellow there can be no explanation possible hereafter there will be no intercourse between my wife and yours simply that nothing more so the men meet at the club as before and there is no further trouble between them the lady upon whom the * is cast says and i am a woman and cant fight while mr chesnut was in town i was at the prestons john * and some other prisoners had asked to walk over the grounds visit the hampton gardens and some friends in columbia after the dreadful state of the public mind at the escape of one of the prisoners general preston was obliged to refuse his request mrs preston and the rest of us wanted him to say yes and so find out who in columbia were his treacherous friends pretty bold people they must be to receive yankee invaders in the midst of the row over one enemy already turned loose amid us general preston said we are about to sacrifice life and fortune for a fickle multitude who will not stand up to us at last the harsh comments made as to his lenient conduct to prisoners have embittered him i told him what i had heard captain trenholm say in his speech he said he would listen to no criticism except from a man with a musket on his shoulder and who had beside enlisted for the war had given up all and had no choice but to succeed or die congress and the newspapers render one desperate ready to cut ones own throat they represent everything in our country as deplorable then comes some one back from our gay and gallant army at the front the spirit of our army keeps us up after all letters from the army revive one they come as welcome as the flowers in may hopeful and bright utterly unconscious of our weak despondency they have taken at nashville more men than we had at manassas there was bad handling of troops we poor women think or this would not be mr venable added bitterly giving up our soldiers to the enemy means giving up the cause we can not replace them the * men were union men generally and the * * the former growl they never liked those aristocratic * and * they had themselves a good and prosperous country a good constitution and were satisfied but they had to * leave all and fight for the others who brought on all the trouble and who do not show too much disposition to fight for themselves that is the extreme * view the extreme * says jeff davis is not enough out of the union yet his inaugural address reads as one of his speeches did four years ago in the united states senate a letter in a morning paper accused mr chesnut of staying too long in charleston the editor was asked for the writers name he gave it as little moses the governors secretary when little moses was spoken to in a great trepidation he said that mrs pickens wrote it and got him to publish it so it was dropped for little moses is such an arrant * no one can believe him besides if that sort of thing * mrs pickens let her amuse herself mary preston went back to mulberry with me from columbia she found a man there tall enough to take her in to * boykin who is six feet four the same height as her father tom was very handsome in his uniform and mary prepared for a nice time but he looked as if he would so much rather she did not talk to him and he set her such a good example saying never a word old colonel chesnut came for us when the train stopped * shiny black was seen on his box as glossy and perfect in his way as his blooded bays but the old colonel would stop and pick up the * little negro i ever saw who was crying by the roadside this ragged little black urchin was made to climb up and sit beside * it * the symmetry of the * but it was a character touch and the old gentleman knows no law but his own will he had a biscuit in his pocket which he gave this * little negro who proved to be his man * son i was ill at mulberry and never left my room doctor boykin came more military than medical colonel chesnut brought him up also teams who said he was down in the mouth our men were not fighting as they should we had only pluck and luck and a dogged spirit of fighting to offset their weight in men and munitions of war i wish i could remember * words this is only his idea his language was quaint and * grammar but no end of sense and good feeling old colonel chesnut catching a word began his litany saying numbers will tell napoleon you know etc etc at mulberry the war has been ever afar off but threats to take the silver came very near * that we had before the revolution silver that mrs chesnut brought from philadelphia jack cantey and doctor boykin came back on the train with us wade hampton is the hero sweet may * lord byron and * make their * catholic

outrages on the plantations and officers had punished them promptly she poured contempt upon * letter to lord russell it was the letter of a * not in the style of a statesman at all we called to see mary mcduffie she asked mary preston what doctor boykin had said of her husband as we came along in the train she heard it was something very complimentary mary p tried to remember and to repeat it all to the joy of the other mary who liked to hear nice things about her husband mary was amazed to hear of the list of * for promotion one * person accompanied his demand for advancement by a request for a written description of the manassas battle he had heard colonel chesnut give such a brilliant account of it in governor cobbs room the merrimac business has come like a gleam of lightning * a dark scene our sky is black and lowering the judge saw his little daughter at my window and he came up he was very smooth and kind it was really a delightful visit not a disagreeable word was spoken he abused no one whatever for he never once spoke of any one but himself and himself he praised without stint he did not look at me once though he spoke very kindly to me second year of confederate

my wishes i can * on with a free will and free conscience congress at the north is down on us they talk largely of hanging slaveowners they say they hold port royal as we did when we took it

her walk with her and flatter her dance until she is warm and tired then propose to walk in a cool shady piazza it must be a somewhat dark piazza begin your promenade slowly warm up to your work draw her arm closer and closer then break her wing heavens what is * her wing why you do not know even that put your arm round her waist and kiss her after that it is all plain sailing she comes down when you call like the coon to captain scott you need not fire captain etc the aspirant for fame as a flirt followed these lucid directions literally but when he seized the poor girl and kissed her she uplifted her voice in terror and screamed as if the house was on fire so quick sharp and shrill were her yells for help that the bold flirt sprang over the banister upon which grew a strong climbing rose this he struggled through and ran toward the college taking a bee line he was so mangled by the thorns that he had to go home and have them picked out by his family the girls brother challenged him there was no mortal combat however for the gay young fellow who had led the * ignorance astray stepped forward and put things straight an explanation and an apology at every turn hushed it all up now we all laughed at this foolish story most heartily but mr venable remained grave and preoccupied and was asked why are you so unmoved it is funny i like more probable fun i have been in college

of her lip some one asked for langdon cheves her brother oh langdon she replied coolly he is a pure patriot he has no ambition while i was there he was letting confederate soldiers ditch through his garden and ruin him at their leisure cotton is five cents a pound and labor of no value at all it commands no price whatever people gladly hire out their negroes to have them fed and clothed which latter can not be done cotton * at # cents a yard leaves no chance to clothe them langdon was for martial law and making the * * their illgotten gains we poor fools who are * ruining ourselves will

hands on board the cumberland went down she fought gallantly and fired a round as she sank the congress ran up a white flag she fired on our boats as they went up to take off her wounded she was burned the worst of it is that all this will arouse them to more furious exertions to destroy us they hated us so before but how now in columbia i do not know a halfdozen men who would not gaily step into jeff daviss shoes with a firm conviction that they would do better in every respect than he does the monstrous conceit the * ignorance of these critics it is pleasant to hear mrs mccord on this subject when they begin to shake their heads and tell us what jeff davis ought to do in the naval battle the other day we had twentyfive guns in all the enemy had fiftyfour in the cumberland fortyfour

* attacked mr chesnut mr chesnut surprised him by knowing beforehand all he had to say naturally i had repeated the loud interchange of views i had overheard in the corridor first nathan davis called then gonzales who presented a fine soldierly appearance in his soldier clothes and the likeness to beauregard was greater than ever nathan all the world knows is by profession a handsome man general gonzales told us what in the bitterness of his soul he had written to jeff davis he regretted that he had not been his classmate then he might have been as well treated as northrop in any case he

while the spaniard railed at his great namesake gonzales said mrs slidell would proudly say that she was a creole they were such fools they thought creole meant here nathan interrupted pleasantly at the st charles in new orleans on the bill of fare were creole eggs when they were brought to a man who had ordered them with perfect simplicity he held them up why they are only hens eggs after all what in heavens name he expected them to be who can say smiled nathan the elegant one lady says as i sit reading in the drawingroom window while maum mary puts my room to rights i clothe my negroes

the fighting he helped me to some * foie gras said madame * * * doctor gibbes however gave it a flavor of his own eat it said he it is good for you rich and wholesome healthy as * oil a queer thing happened at the postoffice a man saw a small boy open with a key the box of the governor and the council take the contents of the box and run for his life of course this man called to the urchin to stop the urchin did not heed but seeing himself pursued began tearing up the letters and papers he was caught and the fragments were picked up finding himself a prisoner he pointed out the negro who gave him the key the negro was arrested governor pickens called to see me today we began with fort sumter for an hour did we hammer at that fortress we took it gun by gun he was very pleasant and friendly in his manner james chesnut has been so nice this winter so reasonable and * is for a man the night i came from madame tognos instead of making a row about the lateness of the hour he said he was so wide awake and so hungry i put on my dressinggown and * some eggs etc there on our own fire and with our feet on the fender and the small * between us we enjoyed the supper and glorious gossip rather a pleasant state of things when ones own husband is in good humor and * than all the men outside this afternoon the entente * still * maum mary beckoned me out mysteriously but mr chesnut said speak out old woman nobody here but myself mars * davis wants to speak to her said she so i hurried off to the drawingroom maum mary flapping her * shoes in my wake hes gwine * somebody done stole his boots how could he stay * boots so nathan said goodby then we met general gist maum mary still hovering near and i congratulated him on being promoted he is now a brigadier this he received with modest * i knowed he was a general said maum mary as he passed on he told me as soon as he got in his room * his boy put down his trunks as nathan the unlucky said goodby he informed me that a mr reed

have one jot of hope he could * mallory for not buying arms in time the very best citizens wanted to * the state government and take things into their own hands the powers that be being inefficient western men are hurrying to the front * themselves in two more months we shall be ready what could i do but laugh i do hope the enemy will be considerate and charitable enough to wait for us mr reeds calm faith in the power of mr * eloquence was beautiful to see he asked for mr chesnut i went back to our rooms swelling with news like a * pigeon mr chesnut said well four * call from nathan davis of four hours men are too absurd so i bear the honors of my forty years gallantly i can but laugh mr nathan davis went by the * train i said it is now about six or seven maybe eight i have had so many visitors mr reed of alabama is asking for you out there he went without a word but i doubt if he went to see mr reed my laughing had made him so angry at last lincoln threatens us with a proclamation abolishing * in the free southern confederacy and they say mcclellan is * they want more * mean the government whose skins are safe they want more fighting and trust to luck for the skill of the new generals i did leave with regret maum mary she was such a good wellinformed old thing my molly though perfection otherwise does not receive the confidential communications of * generals at the earliest moment she is of very limited military information maum mary was the comfort of my life she saved me from all trouble as far as she could seventy if she is a day she is * and active as a cat of a curiosity that knows no bounds black and clean also she knows a joke at first sight and she is honest i fancy the negroes are ashamed to rob people as careless as james chesnut and myself one night just before we left the congaree house mr chesnut had forgotten to tell some * thing to governor gist who was to leave on a public mission next day so at the dawn of day he put on his dressinggown and went to the governors room he found the door unlocked and the governor fast asleep he shook him * the governor sprang up and threw his arms around mr chesnuts neck and said honey is it you the mistake was rapidly set right and the bewildered plenipotentiary was given his instructions mr chesnut came into my room threw himself on the sofa and nearly laughed himself to extinction * again and again the pathetic tone of the governors greeting mr chesnut calls lawrence * but says he is simply perfect as a servant mary stevens said i thought cousin james the * man alive until i knew his man lawrence lawrence will not move an inch or lift a finger for any one but his master mrs middleton politely sent him on an errand lawrence too was very polite hours after she saw him sitting on the fence of the front yard didnt you go she asked no maam i am waiting for mars jeems mrs middleton calls him now mr * my very last days experience at the congaree i was waiting for mars jeems in the drawingroom when a lady there declared herself to be the wife of an officer in clingmans regiment a gentleman who seemed quite friendly with her told her all mr chesnut said thought intended to do wrote and felt i asked are you certain of all these things you say of colonel chesnut the man hardly deigned to notice this impertinent interruption from a stranger presuming to speak but who had not been introduced after he went out the wife of clingmans officer was seized with an intuitive curiosity madam will you tell me your name i gave it adding i dare say i showed myself an intelligent listener when my husbands affairs were under discussion at first i refused to give my name because it would have embarrassed her friend if she had told him who i was the man was mr chesnuts secretary but i had never seen him before a letter from kate says she had been up all night preparing davids things little serena sat up and helped her mother they did not know that they would ever see him again upon reading it i wept and james chesnut cursed the yankees gave the girls a quantity of flannel for soldiers shirts also a string of pearls to be * for at the gunboat fair mary witherspoon has sent a silver * we do not spare our precious things now our silver and gold what are * we give up to war our beloved dr trezevant attending mr chesnut who was ill came and found his patient gone he could not stand the news of that last battle he got up and dressed weak as he was and went forth to hear what he could for himself the doctor was angry with me for permitting this and more angry with him for such folly i made him listen to the distinction between feminine folly and virulent vagaries and nonsense he said he will certainly be * after all that * out in this damp weather today the ladies in their * were bitterly attacked by the morning paper for * back in their silks and * with tall footmen in livery driving up and down the streets while the poor soldiers wives were on the sidewalks it is the old story of rich and poor my little * is not here nor has james chesnut any of his horses here but then i drive every day with mrs mccord and mrs preston either of whose * fills the bill the governors carriage horses servants etc are * what they should be why not our fair is in full blast we keep a restaurant our * are mary and buck preston isabella martin and grace * trescott is too clever ever to be a bore that was proved today for he stayed two hours as usual mr chesnut said four trescott was very surly calls himself * of state of the united states now nothing in particular of south carolina or the confederate states then he yawned what a bore this war is i wish it was ended one way or another he speaks of going across the border and taking service in mexico rubbish not much mexico for you i answered another patriot came then and averred i will take my family back to town that we may all surrender together i gave it up early in the spring trescott made a face behind backs and said * the enemy have flanked beauregard at nashville there is grief enough for albert sidney johnston now we begin to see what we have lost we were pushing them into the river when general johnston was wounded beauregard was lying in his tent at the rear in a green * no matter what the name of the malady he was too slow to move and lost all the advantage gained by our dead hero without him there is no head to our western army pulaski has fallen what more is there to fall mrs middleton how did you settle mollys little difficulty with mrs * that piece of her mind that molly gave our landlady oh paid our way out of it of course and i apologized for molly gladden the hero of the * in mexico is killed shiloh has been a dreadful blow to us last winter stephen my brother had it in his power to do such a nice thing for colonel gladden in the dark he heard his name also that he had to walk twentyfive miles in alabama mud or go on an ammunition wagon so he introduced himself as a south carolinian to colonel gladden whom he knew only by reputation as colonel of the palmetto regiment in the mexican war and they drove him in his carriage comfortably to where he wanted to * night drive of fifty miles for stephen for he had the return trip too i would rather live in * worse still in sahara than live in a country surrendered to yankees the carolinian says the conscription bill passed by congress is fatal to our liberties as a people let us be a people certain and sure as poor tom b said and then talk of * against our home government sat up all night read * straight through our old * and putnam edition that we bought in london in 1845 how could i sleep the power they are bringing to bear against our country is tremendous its weight may be * dare not think of that however have been ill one day i dined at mrs prestons * de foie gras and partridge prepared for me as i like them i had been awfully depressed for days and could not sleep at night for anxiety but i did not know that i was bodily ill mrs preston came home with me she said emphatically molly if your mistress is worse in the night send for me instantly i thought it very odd i could not breathe if i attempted to lie down and very soon i lost my voice molly raced out and sent lawrence for doctor trezevant she said i had the croup the doctor said congestion of the lungs so here i am stranded laid by the heels battle after battle has occurred disaster after disaster every mornings paper is enough to kill a well woman and age a strong and hearty one today the waters of this stagnant pool were wildly stirred the president telegraphed for my husband to come on to richmond and offered him a place on his staff i was a joyful woman it was a way opened by providence from this slough of despond this council whose counsel no one takes i wrote to mr davis with thanks and begging your pardon how i would like to go mrs preston agrees with me mr chesnut ought to go through mr chesnut the president might hear many things to the advantage of our state etc letter from * washington that was the best tonic yet he writes so cheerfully we have fifty thousand men on the peninsula and mcclellan eighty thousand we expect that much disparity of numbers we can stand that on april 23 1840 i was married aged seventeen consequently on the 31st of march 1862 i was thirtynine i saw a wedding today from my window which opens on trinity church * shand married a doctor wilson then a beautiful bevy of girls rushed into my room such a flutter and a chatter well thank heaven for a wedding it is a charming relief from the dismal litany of our daily song a letter today from our octogenarian at mulberry his nephew jack deas had two horses shot under him the old colonel has his growl thats enough for glory and no hurt after all he ends however with his neverfailing refrain we cant fight all the world two and two only make four it cant make a thousand numbers will not lie he says he has lost half a million already in railroad bonds bank stock western notes of hand not to speak of negroes to be freed and lands to be confiscated for he takes the gloomiest views of all things doleful * alarmbells ringing telegrams say the mortar fleet has passed the forts at new orleans down into the very depths of despair are we new orleans gone and with it the confederacy that mississippi ruins us if lost the confederacy has been done to death by the politicians what wonder we are lost the soldiers have done their duty all honor to the army statesmen as busy as bees about their own places or their personal honor too busy to see the enemy at a distance with a * they were examining their own interests or their own wrongs forgetting the interests of the people they represented they were * newspaper paragraphs to injure the government no matter how vital it may be nothing can be kept from the enemy they must publish themselves night and day what they are doing or the * * will forget them this fall of new orleans means utter ruin to the private fortunes of the prestons mr preston came from new orleans so satisfied with mansfield lovell and the tremendous * he saw there while in new orleans burnside offered mr preston five hundred thousand dollars a debt due to him from burnside and he refused to take it he said the money was safer in burnsides hands than his and so it may prove so ugly is the outlook now burnside is wide awake he is not a man to be caught * mary preston was saying she had asked the hamptons how they * the idea of being paupers if the country is saved none of us will care for that sort of thing philosophical and patriotic mr chesnut came in saying * has been telegraphed from new orleans that the great ironclad louisiana went down at the first shot mr chesnut and mary preston walked off first to the bulletinboard and then to the prestons a grand smash the news from new orleans fatal to us met mr * he wanted to know where he could find a place of safety for two hundred negroes i looked into his face to see if he were in earnest then to see if he were sane there was a certain set of two hundred negroes that had grown to be a nuisance apparently all the white men of the family had felt bound to stay at home to take care of them there are people who still believe negroes * noahs neighbors who insisted that the deluge would only be a little shower after all these negroes however were * * a totally different part of speech he gave * to one company and forty thousand dollars to another he is away with our army at corinth so i said you may rely upon mr chesnut who will assist you to his * in finding a home for these people nothing belonging to that patriotic gentleman shall come to grief if we have to take charge of them on our own place mr chesnut did get a place for them as i said he would had to go to the governors or they would think we had hoisted the black flag heard there we are going to be beaten as * beat the * superior arms mexican bows and arrows made a poor showing in the face of spanish accoutrements our enemies have such superior weapons of war we hardly any but what we capture from them in the fray the * and the * were in the same plight war seems a game of chess but we have an unequal number of * to begin with we have knights kings queens bishops and castles enough but our skilful generals whenever they can not arrange the board to suit them exactly burn up everything and march away we want them to save the country they seem to think their whole duty is to destroy ships and save the army mr robert barnwell wrote that he had to hang his head for south carolina we had not furnished our quota of the new levy five thousand men today colonel chesnut published his statement to show that we have sent thirteen thousand instead of the mere number required of us so mr barnwell can hold up his head again the last day of this month of calamities lovell left the women and children to be shelled and took the army to a safe place i do not understand why we do not send the women and children to the safe place and let the army stay where the fighting is to be armies are to save not to be saved at least to be saved is not their * * exactly if this goes on the spirit of our people will be broken one ray of comfort comes from henry marshall our army of the peninsula is fine so good i do not think mcclellan will venture to attack it so * it be mine is a painful selfimposed task but why write when i have nothing to chronicle but disaster so i read instead first * then * two ends of the pole certainly and then a translated edition of elective affinities food enough for thought in every one of this odd assortment of books at the prestons where i am staying because mr chesnut has gone to see his * old father whom he loves and who is reported ill i met christopher hampton he tells us wigfall is out on a * wants them to strike for maryland the presidents opinion of the move is not given also mr hampton met the first lieutenant of the * e m boykin says he is just the same man he was in the south carolina college in whatever company you may meet him he is the pleasantest man there a telegram reads we have repulsed the enemy at williamsburg oh if we could drive them back to their ain * richmond was hard pressed this day the mercury of today says jeff davis now treats all men as if they were idiotic insects mary preston said all sisters quarreled no we never quarrel i and mine we keep all our bitter words for our enemies we are frank heathens we hate our enemies and love our friends some people our kind can never make up after a quarrel hard words once only and all is over to us forgiveness is impossible forgiveness means calm indifference philosophy while love lasts forgiveness of loves wrongs is impossible those * wives who piously * * not care one fig for their husbands i settled that in my own mind years ago some people think it magnanimous to praise their enemies and to show their impartiality and justice by acknowledging the faults of their friends i am for the simple rule the good old plan i praise whom i love and abuse whom i hate mary preston has been translating schiller aloud we are provided with bulwers translation mrs * coleridges and carlyles and we show how each renders the passage mary is to convert into english in * at one point of the max and * scene i like carlyle better than coleridge though they say coleridges * is the only translation in the world half so good as the original mrs * repeated some

beauregard but the soldiers who stopped to drink the whisky they had captured from the enemy lost us shiloh cock robin is as dead as he ever will be now what matters it who killed him mr chesnut says he is very glad he went to town everything in charleston is so much more satisfactory than it is reported troops are in good spirits it will take a lot of ironclads to take that city isaac hayne said at dinner yesterday that both beauregard and the president had a great opinion of mr chesnuts natural ability for strategy and military evolution hon mr barnwell concurred that is mr barnwell had been told so by the president then why did not the president offer me something better than an * i heard he offered to make you a general last year and you said you could not go over other mens shoulders until you had earned promotion you are too hard to please no not exactly that i was only offered a colonelcy and mr barnwell persuaded me to stick to the senate then he wanted my place and between the

foot of virginia soil is to be given up without a bitter fight for it we have one hundred and five thousand men in all mcclellan one hundred and ninety thousand we can stand that disparity what things i have been said to have said mr heard me make scoffing remarks about the governor and the * he thinks he heard me james chesnut wrote him a note that my name was to be kept out of * that he was never

to the last point columbia is the place for good living pleasant people pleasant dinners pleasant drives i feel that i have put the dinners in the wrong place they are the climax of the good things here this is the most hospitable place in the world and the dinners are worthy of it in washington there was an endless succession of state dinners i was kindly used i do not remember ever being condemned to two dull neighbors on one side or the other was a clever man so i liked washington dinners in montgomery there were a few * * for instance but the society was not smoothed down or in shape such as it was it was given over to balls and suppers in charleston mr chesnut went to * dinners all the time no ladies present flowers were sent to me and i was taken to drive and asked to tea there could not have been nicer suppers more perfect of their kind than were to be found at the winding up of those festivities in richmond there were balls which i did not * few to which i was asked the * and * all i can remember james chesnut dined out nearly every day but then the * virginia * were always pleasant people indeed i have had a good time * clever people and people i liked and everybody so good to me here in columbia family dinners are the * you call or they pick you up and drive home with you oh stay to dinner and you stay gladly they send for your husband and he comes

which took place during a ball given by mrs preston while her husband was in louisiana mrs preston was resplendent in diamonds point lace and velvet there is a gentle dignity about her which is very attractive her voice is low and sweet and her will is iron she is exceedingly well informed but very quiet retiring and reserved indeed her apparent gentleness almost amounts to timidity she has * regularity of features a majestic figure perfectly * governor manning said to me look at sister caroline does she look as if she had the pluck of a heroine then he related how a little while ago william the butler came to tell her that john the * was drunk in the * with drink that he had a carvingknife which he was brandishing in drunken fury and he was keeping everybody from their business threatening to kill any one who dared to go into the basement they were like a flock of frightened sheep down there she did not speak to one of us but followed william down to the basement holding up her skirts she found the servants scurrying everywhere screaming and shouting that john was crazy and going to kill them john was bellowing like a bull of * knife in hand chasing them at his pleasure mrs preston walked up to him give me that knife she demanded he handed it to her she laid it on the table now come with me she said putting her hand on his collar she led him away to the empty smokehouse and there she locked him in and put the key in her pocket then she returned to her guests without a ripple on her placid face she told me of it smiling and serene as you see her now the governor concluded before the war shut him in general preston sent to the lakes for his salmon to mississippi for his venison to the mountains for his mutton and * it is good enough the best dish at all these houses what the spanish call the hearty welcome thackeray says at every american table he was first served with * hostess at the head of the table sat a person * anxious nervous inwardly

not eat hot corn bread * and hot buttered biscuit without any richmond is obliged to fall sighed mrs gibson you would say so too if you had seen our poor soldiers poor soldiers said i are you talking of stonewall jacksons men poor soldiers indeed she said her mind was fixed on one point and had ever been though she married and came south she never would own slaves who would that was not born to it i cried more excited than ever she is very handsome very clever and has very agreeable manners dear madam she says with tears in her beautiful eyes they have three armies but stonewall has routed one of them already heath another she only answered by an * moan nothing seemed to suit her i said as we went away you did not certainly said some one to me you contradicted every word she said with a sort of indignant protest we met mrs hampton gibbes at the * virginia woman as good as gold they told us mrs davis was delightfully situated at raleigh north carolinians so loyal so hospitable she had not been allowed to eat a meal at the hotel how different from columbia said doctor gibbes looking at mrs gibson who has no doubt been left to take all of her meals at his house oh no cried mary you do columbia injustice mrs chesnut used to tell us that she was never once turned over to the tender mercies of the congaree cuisine and at mcmahans it is fruit flowers invitations to dinner every day after we came away why did you not back me up i was asked why did you let them slander columbia it was awfully awkward i said but you see it would have been worse to let doctor gibbes and mrs gibson see how different it was with other people took a moonlight walk after tea at the halcott greens all the company did honor to the beautiful night by walking home with me uncle hamilton boykin is here staying at the de * he says manassas was play to williamsburg and he was at both battles he lead a part of stuarts cavalry in the charge at williamsburg riding a hundred yards ahead of his company toombs is ready for another revolution and curses freely everything confederate from the president down to a horse boy he thinks there is a conspiracy against him in the army why heavens and * a battle is said to be raging round richmond i am at the prestons james chesnut has gone to richmond suddenly on business of the military department it is always his luck to arrive in the nick of time and be present at a great battle wade hampton shot in the foot and johnston pettigrew killed a telegram says lee and davis were both on the field the enemy being repulsed telegraph operator said madam our men are fighting of course they are what else is there for them to do now but fight but madam the news is encouraging each army is burying its dead that looks like a drawn battle we haunt the bulletinboard back to mcmahans mem cohen is ill her daughter isabel * me not to mention the battle raging around richmond young cohen is in it mrs preston anxious and unhappy about her sons john is with general huger at richmond willie in the swamps on the coast with his company mem tells me her cousin edwin de leon is sent by mr davis on a mission to england rev robert barnwell has returned to the hospital oh that we had given our thousand dollars to the hospital and not to the gunboat stonewall jacksons movements the herald says do us no harm it is bringing out volunteers in great numbers and a philadelphia paper abused us so fervently i felt all the blood in me rush to my head with rage doctor john cheves is making infernal machines in charleston to blow the yankees up pretty name they have those machines my horses the overseer says are too poor to send over there was corn enough on the place for two years they said in january now in june they write that it will not last until the new crop comes in somebody is having a good time on the plantation if it be not my poor horses molly will tell me all when she comes back and more mr venable has been made an aide to general robert e lee he is at vicksburg and writes when the fight is over here i shall be glad to go to virginia he is in capital spirits i notice army men all are when they write apropos of calling major venable mr let it be noted that in social intercourse we are not prone to give handles to the names of those we know well and of our nearest and dearest a generals wife thinks it bad form to call her husband anything but mr when she gives him his title she simply drops into it by accident if i am mixed on titles in this diary let no one blame me telegrams come from richmond ordering troops from charleston can not be sent for the yankees are attacking charleston doubtless with the purpose to prevent lees receiving reenforcements from there sat down at my window in the beautiful moonlight and tried hard for pleasant thoughts a man began to play on the flute with piano accompaniment first ever of thee i am fondly dreaming and then the long long weary day at first i found this but a complement to the beautiful scene and it was soothing to my * nerves but von * last * was too much i broke down heavens what a bitter cry came forth with such floods of tears the wonder is there was any of me left i learn that richmond women go in their carriages for the wounded carry them home and nurse them one saw a man too weak to hold his musket she took it from him put it on her shoulder and helped the poor fellow along if ever there was a man who could control every expression of emotion who could play stoic or an indian chief it is james chesnut but one day when he came in from the council he had to own to a * he was awfully ashamed of his weakness there was a letter from mrs * asking him to help her and he tried to read it to the council she wanted a permit to go on to her son who lies wounded in virginia colonel chesnut could not control his voice there was not a dry eye there when suddenly one man called out god bless the woman johnston pettigrews aide says he left his chief mortally wounded on the battlefield just before johnston pettigrew went to italy to take a hand in the war there for freedom i met him one day at mrs frank hamptons a number of people were present some one spoke of the engagement of the beautiful miss to hugh rose some one else asked how do you know they are engaged well i never heard it but i saw it in london a month or so ago i entered mrs s drawingroom and i saw these two young people seated on a sofa opposite the door well that amounted to nothing no not in itself but they looked so foolish and so happy i have noticed newly engaged people always look that way and so on johnston pettigrew was white and red in quick succession during this turn of the conversation he was in a rage of indignation and disgust i think this kind of talk is taking a liberty with the young ladys name he exclaimed finally and that it is an impertinence in us i fancy him left dying alone i wonder what they * who are left to die of their * the battlefield free schools are not everything as witness this spelling yankee epistles found in camp show how * they can be with all their boasted schools fredericksburg is spelled * medicine * and we read to my sweat brother etc for the first time in my life no books can interest me life is so real so utterly earnest that fiction is flat nothing but what is going on in this distracted world of ours can arrest my attention for ten minutes at a time battles occur near richmond with bombardment of charleston beauregard is said to be fighting his way out or in mrs gibson is here at doctor gibbess tears are always in her eyes her eldest son is willie prestons lieutenant they are down on the coast she owns that she has no hope at all she was a miss * of philadelphia and says we may look for burnside now our troops which held him down to his iron flotilla have been withdrawn they are three to one against us now and they have hardly begun to put out their * numbers i mean we have come to the end of our * except we wait for the * crop of boys as they grow up to the requisite age she would make despondent the most sanguine person alive as a general rule says mrs gibson government people are sanguine but the son of one high functionary whispered to mary g as he handed her into the car richmond is bound to go the idea now is that we are to be starved out if they shut us in prolong the agony it can then have but one end mrs preston and i speak in whispers but mrs mccord * whispers and speaks out she says there are our soldiers since the world began there never were better but god does not deign to send us a general worthy of them i do not mean * or military old maids who will not fight until everything is just so the real ammunition of our war is faith in ourselves and enthusiasm in our cause west point sits down on enthusiasm laughs it to scorn it wants discipline and now comes a new danger these blockaderunners they are filling their pockets and they * and sneer at the fools who fight dont you see this stonewall how he fires the soldiers hearts he will be our leader maybe after all they say he does not care how many are killed his business is to save the country not the army he fights to win god bless him and he wins if they do not want to be killed they can stay at home they say he leaves the sick and wounded to be cared for by those whose business it is to do so his business is war they say he wants to * the black flag have a short sharp decisive war and end it he is a christian soldier beauregard retreating and his rearguard cut off if beauregards veterans will not stand why should we expect our newly levied reserves to do it the yankee general who is * savannah announces his orders are to take savannah in two weeks time and then proceed to erase charleston from the face of the earth albert luryea was killed in the battle of june 1st last summer when a bomb fell in the very thick of his company he picked it up and threw it into the water think of that those of ye who love life the company sent the bomb to his father inscribed on it were the words albert luryea bravest where all are brave isaac hayne did the same thing at fort moultrie this race has brains enough but they are not * like those old revolutionary characters the middletons * rutledges * sumters they have come direct from * forefathers or they would not have been here but with two or three generations of gentlemen planters how changed has the blood become of late all the * men who have sprung to the front in our government were immediate descendants of scotch or * mcduffie cheves and petigru who * his name but could not tie up his irish our planters are nice fellows but slow to move impulsive but hard to keep moving they are wonderful for a * but with all their strength they like to rest paul hayne the poet has taken rooms here my husband came and offered to buy me a pair of horses he says i need more exercise in the open air come now are you providing me with the means of a rapid retreat said i i am pretty badly equipped for marching mrs rose greenhow is in richmond onehalf of the ungrateful confederates say seward sent her my husband says the confederacy owes her a debt it can never pay she warned them at manassas and so they got joe johnston and his * to appear upon the stage in the very nick of time in washington they said lord * left her a legacy to the british legation which accepted the gift unlike the british nation who would not accept emma hamilton and her daughter * though they were willed to the nation by lord nelson mem cohen fresh from the hospital where she went with a beautiful jewish friend rachel as we will call her be it her name or no was put to feed a very weak patient mem noticed what a handsome fellow he was and how quiet and clean she fancied by those tokens that he was a gentleman in performance of her duties the lovely young nurse leaned kindly over him and held the cup to his lips when that ceremony was over and she had wiped his mouth to her horror she felt a pair of by no means weak arms around her neck and a kiss upon her lips which she thought strong indeed she did not say a word she made no complaint she slipped away from the hospital and hereafter in her hospital work will minister at long range no matter how weak and weary sick and sore the patient may be and said mem i thought he was a gentleman well a gentleman is a man after all and she ought not to have put those red lips of hers so near cheves mccords battery on the coast has three guns and one hundred men if this battery should be captured johns island and james island would be open to the enemy and so charleston exposed utterly wade hampton writes to his wife that chickahominy was not as decided a victory as he could have wished fort pillow and memphis have been given up next and next when we read of the battles in india in italy in the crimea what did we care only an interesting topic like any other to look for in the paper now you hear of a battle with a thrill and a shudder it has come home to us half the people that we know in the world are under the enemys guns a telegram reaches you and you leave it on your lap you are pale with fright you handle it or you dread to touch it as you would a rattlesnake worse worse a snake could only strike you how many many will this scrap of paper tell you have gone to their death when you meet people sad and sorrowful is the greeting they press your hand tears stand in their eyes or roll down their cheeks as they happen to possess more or less selfcontrol they have brother father or sons as the case may be in battle and now this thing seems never to stop we have no breathing time given us it can not be so at the north for the papers say gentlemen do not go into the ranks there but are officers or clerks of departments then we see so many members of foreign regiments among our * irish scotch the proportion of trouble is awfully against us every company on the field rank and file is filled with our nearest and dearest who are common soldiers mem * story today a woman she knew heard her son was killed and had hardly taken in the horror of it when they came to say it was all a mistake in the name she fell on her knees with a shout of joy praise the lord o my soul she cried in her wild delight the household was totally upset the * of the pendulum from the scene of weeping and wailing of a few moments before was very exciting in the midst of this * the hearse drove up with the poor boy in his metallic coffin does anybody wonder so many women die grief and constant anxiety kill nearly as many women at home as men are killed on the battlefield * friend is at the point of death with brain fever the sudden changes from grief to joy and joy to grief were more than she could bear a story from new orleans as some yankees passed two boys playing in the street one of the boys threw a handful of burned cotton at them saying i keep this for you the other not to be * spit at the yankees and said i keep this for you the yankees marked the house afterward a corporals guard came madam was * conversing with a friend and in vain the friend who was a mere morning caller protested he was not the master of the house he was marched off to prison mr * got his money out of new orleans he went to a station with his two sons who were quite small boys when he got there the carriage that he expected was not to be seen he had brought no money with him knowing he might be searched some friend called out i will lend you my horse but then you will be obliged to leave the children this offer was accepted and as he rode off one of the boys called out papa here is your tobacco which you have forgotten mr * turned back and the boy handed up a roll of tobacco which he had held openly in his hand all the time mr * took it and galloped off waving his hat to them in that roll of tobacco was encased twentyfive thousand dollars now the mississippi is virtually open to the yankees beauregard has evacuated corinth henry * was killed at shiloh mrs * wrote to tell us she had no hope to be conquered and ruined had always been her fate strive as she might and now she knew it would be through her country that she would be made to feel she had had more than most women to endure and the battle of life she had tried to fight with courage patience faith long years ago when she was young her lover died afterward she married another then her husband died and next her only son when new orleans fell her only daughter was there and mrs * went to her well may she say that she has bravely borne her burden till now stonewall said in his quaint way i like strong drink so i never touch it may heaven who sent him to help us save him from all harm my husband traced stonewalls triumphal career on the map he has defeated * and taken all his cannon now he is after shields the language of the telegram is vague stonewall has taken plenty of * no doubt and enough and to spare we cant feed our own soldiers and how are we to feed prisoners they denounce toombs in some georgia paper which i saw today for planting a full crop of cotton they say he ought to plant provisions for soldiers and now every man in virginia and the eastern part of south carolina is in revolt because old men and boys are ordered out as a reserve corps and worst of all sacred property that is negroes have been seized and sent out to work on the fortifications along the coast line we are in a fine condition to fortify columbia general gregg writes that chickahominy was a victory * because joe johnston received a * wound and g w smith was ill the subordinates in command had not been made acquainted with the plan of battle a letter from john chesnut who says it must be all a mistake about wade hamptons wound for he saw him in the field to the very last that is until late that night hampton writes to mary mcduffie that the ball was extracted from his foot on the field and that he was in the saddle all day but that when he tried to take his boot off at night his foot was so inflamed and swollen the boot had to be cut away and the wound became more troublesome than he had expected mrs preston sent her carriage to take us to see mrs * whom mary gibson calls her mrs * miss bay came down * in a cap so formidable i could but laugh it was covered with a bristling row of white satin spikes she * refused to enter mrs prestons * put foot into it to use her own words but she allowed herself to be * i am so ill mrs ben taylor said to doctor trezevant surely she is too ill to be going about she ought to be in bed she is very feeble very nervous as you say but then she is living on nervous excitement if you shut her up she would die at once a queer weakness of the heart i have sometimes it beats so feebly i am sure it has stopped altogether then they say i have fainted but i never lose consciousness mrs preston and i were talking of negroes and cows a negro no matter how sensible he is on any other subject can never be convinced that there is any necessity to feed a cow turn em out and let em grass grass good * for cow famous news comes from richmond but not so good from the coast mrs izard said quoting i forget whom if west point could give brains as well as training smith is under arrest for disobedience of * orders this is the third general whom pemberton has displaced within a few * * and now smith when i told my husband that molly was full of airs since her late trip home he made answer tell her to go to the * or anybody else on the plantation who is dissatisfied let them go it is bother enough to feed and clothe them now when he went over to the plantation he returned charmed with their loyalty to him their affection and their faithfulness sixteen more yankee regiments have landed on james island * writes they have twice the energy and enterprise of our people i answered wait a while let them alone until climate and mosquitoes and * and dealing with negroes takes it all out of them stonewall is a regular brick going all the time winning his way wherever he goes governor pickens called to see me his wife is in great trouble anxiety uncertainty her brother and her brotherinlaw are either killed or taken prisoners tom taylor says wade hampton did not leave the field on account of his wound what heroism said some one no what luck he is the * man alive hell never be killed he was shot in the temple but that did not kill him his soldiers believe in his luck general scott on southern soldiers says we have lan courage * consummate horsemanship endurance of pain equal to the indians but that we will not submit to discipline we will not take care of things or husband our resources where we are there is waste and destruction if it could all be done by one wild desperate dash we would do it but he does not think we can stand the long blank months between the * waiting we can bear pain without a murmur but we will not submit to be bored etc now for the other side men of the north can wait they can bear discipline they can endure forever losses in battle are nothing to them their resources in men and materials of war are inexhaustible and if they see fit they will fight to the bitter end here is a nice prospect for * comfortable as the old mans * at mulberry bad times worse coming mrs mccord says in the hospital the better born that is those born in the purple the gentry those who are accustomed to a life of luxury are the better patients they endure in silence they are * stronger * less liable to break down than the sons of the soil why is that i asked and she answered something in man that is more than the body i know how it feels to die i have felt it again and again for instance some one calls out albert sidney johnston is killed my heart stands still i feel no more i am for so many seconds so many minutes i know not how long utterly without sensation of any * and then there is that great throb that keen agony of physical pain and the works are wound up again the ticking of the clock begins and i take up the burden of life once more some day it will stop too long or my feeble heart will be too worn out to make that awakening jar and all will be over i do not think when the end comes that there will be any difference except the miracle of the new * throb and now good news is just as exciting as bad hurrah stonewall has saved us the pleasure is almost pain because of my way of feeling it miriams luryea and the coincidences of his life he was born moses and is the hero of the bombshell his mother was at a hotel in charleston when kindhearted anna de leon moses went for her sisterinlaw and gave up her own chamber that the child might be born in the comfort and privacy of a home only our people are given to such excessive hospitality so little luryea was born in anna de * chamber after chickahominy when he now a man lay mortally wounded anna moses who was living in richmond found him and she brought him home though her house was crowded to the doorsteps she gave up her chamber to him and so as he had been born in her room in her room he died new * butler best known to us as beast butler is famous or infamous now his * order to his soldiers at new orleans and comments on it are in everybodys mouth we hardly expected from massachusetts behavior to shame a * one happy moment has come into mrs prestons life i watched her face today as she read the morning papers * battery is * to the skies every paper gave him a paragraph of praise south carolina was at beauregards feet after fort sumter since shiloh she has gotten up and looks * rather when his name is mentioned and without price or beauregard who takes charge of the western forces can we hold out if england and france hold off cries mem no our time has come for shame faint heart our people are brave our cause is just our spirit and our patient endurance beyond reproach here came in mary * voice i may not have any logic any sense i give it up my womans instinct tells me all the same that * time has come if we dont end it they will after all this tried to read uncle tom but could not too sickening think of a man sending his little son to beat a human being tied to a tree it is as bad as squeers beating * flesh and blood revolt you must * that it is too bad mr preston told a story of joe johnston as a boy a party of boys at abingdon were out on a * more boys than horses so joe johnston rode behind john preston who is his cousin while going over the mountains they tried to change horses and got behind a servant who was in charge of them all the servants horse kicked up threw joe johnston and broke his leg a bone showed itself hello boys come here and look the confounded bone has come clear through called out joe coolly they had to carry him on their shoulders relieving guard as one party grew tired another took him up they knew he must suffer fearfully but he never said so he was as cool and quiet after his hurt as before he was pretty roughly handled but they could not help it his father was in a towering rage because his sons leg was to be set by a country doctor and it might be crooked in the process at chickahominy brave but unlucky joe had already eleven wounds deccas wedding it took place last year we were all lying on the bed or sofas taking it coolly as to undress mrs singleton had the floor they were engaged before they went up to charlottesville alexander was on greggs staff and gregg was not hard on him decca was the worst in love girl she ever saw letters came while we were at the hospital from alex urging her to let him marry her at once in war times human events life especially are very uncertain for several days * she cried without ceasing and then she consented the rooms at the hospital were all crowded decca and i slept together in the same room it was arranged by letter that the marriage should take place a luncheon at her grandfather minors and then she was to depart with alex for a few days at richmond that was to be their brief * of honeymoon the day came the * was ready so was the bride in all her bridal array but no alex no bridegroom alas such is the uncertainty of a soldiers life the bride said nothing but she wept like a * at dinner she plucked up heart and at my earnest request was about to join us and then the cry the bridegroom cometh he brought his best man and other friends we had a jolly dinner circumstances over which he had no control had kept him away his father sat next to decca and talked to her all the time as if she had been already married it was a piece of * on his part pure and simple but it was very trying and the girl had had much to stand that morning you can well understand immediately after dinner the belated bridegroom proposed a walk so they went for a brief stroll up the mountain decca upon her return said to me send for robert barnwell i mean to be married today impossible no spare room in the house no getting away from here the trains all gone dont you know this hospital place is crammed to the ceiling alex says i promised to marry him today it is not his fault he could not come before i shook my head i dont care said the positive little thing i promised alex to marry him today and i will send for the rev robert barnwell we found robert after a world of trouble and the bride lovely in swiss muslin was married then i proposed they should take another walk and i went to one of my sister nurses and begged her to take me in for the night as i wished to resign my room to the young couple at daylight next day they took the train for richmond such is the small allowance of honeymoon permitted in war time beauregards telegram he can not leave the army of the west his health is bad no doubt the sea breezes would restore him * can not come now such a lovely * * beauregard but jackson and johnston and smith and jones will * lee how short and sweet every day says mem they come here in * to say we can not hold richmond and we can not hold charleston much longer wretches beasts why do you come here why dont you stay there and fight dont you see that you own yourselves cowards by coming away in the very face of a battle if you are not liars as to the danger you are cowards to run away from it thus * the practical mem growing more furious at each word these * laugh they think she means others not the present company tom huger resigned his place in the united states navy and came to us the iroquois was his ship in the old navy they say as he stood in the rigging after he was shot in the leg when his ship was leading the attack upon the iroquois his old crew in the iroquois cheered him and when his body was borne in the federals took off their caps in respect for his gallant conduct when he was dying * huger said to him an officer wants to see you he is one of the enemy let him come in i have no enemies now but when he heard the mans name no no i do not want to see a southern man who is now in lincolns navy the officers of the united states navy attended his funeral all things are against us memphis gone mississippi fleet annihilated and we hear it all as * apathetic as if it were a story of the english war against china which happened a year or so ago the sons of mrs john

chesnut is in whitings brigade which has been sent to stonewall * son is with the boykin rangers company a no 1 we call it and she has persistently wept ever since she heard the news it is no childs play she says when you are with stonewall he doesnt play at soldiering he doesnt take care of his men at all he only goes to kill the yankees wade hampton is here shot in the foot but he knows no more about france than he does of the man in the moon wet blanket he is just now johnston badly wounded lee is king of spades they are all once more digging for dear life unless we can reenforce stonewall the game is up our chiefs contrive to * and destroy the enthusiasm of all who go near them so much * and falling back * the morale of any army this everlasting retreating it kills the hearts of the

pillow and memphis a man must be sent there or it is all gone now you call a spade by that name it seems and not an agricultural * they call mars robert old spade lee he keeps them digging so general lee is a noble virginian respect something in this world * him old spade csar as a soldier he was as much above suspicion as he required his wife to be as csars wife you know if i remember csars commentaries he owns up to a lot of * you let mars robert alone he knows what he is about tell us of the women folk at new orleans how did they take the fall of the city they are an excitable race the man from that city said as my informant was standing on the levee a daintily dressed lady picked her way parasol in hand toward him she accosted him with great politeness and her face was as placid and unmoved as in antebellum days her first question was will you be so kind as to tell me what is the last general order no order that i know of madam general disorder prevails now ah i see and why are those persons flying and yelling so * and racing in the streets in that unseemly way they are looking for a shell to burst over their heads at any moment ah then with a courtesy of dignity and grace she waved her parasol and departed but stopped to arrange that parasol at a proper angle to protect her face from the sun there was no vulgar haste in her movements she tripped away as gracefully as she came my informant had failed to * her by his fearful revelations that was the one selfpossessed soul then in new orleans another woman drew near so * and out of breath she had barely time to say she had run miles of squares in her crazy terror and bewilderment when a sudden shower came up in a second she was cool and calm she forgot all the questions she came to ask my bonnet i must save it at any sacrifice she said and so turned her dress over her head and went off forgetting her countrys trouble and screaming for a cab went to see mrs * at the old de saussure house she has such a sweet face such soft kind beautiful * eyes such eyes are a poem no wonder she had a long * we sat in the piazza at twelve oclock of a june day the glorious southern sun shining its very hottest but we were in a dense * in full bloom ivy vines of i know not what and roses in profusion closed us in it was a living wall of everything beautiful and sweet in all this flowergarden of a columbia that is the most delicious corner i have been in yet got from the prestons french library fanny with a brilliant preface by jules * now then i have come to the worst there can be no worse book than fanny the lover is jealous of the husband the woman is for the * rule of life she * both and refuses to break with either but to * it one must be as shameless as the book itself of course it is clever to the last degree or it would be kicked into the gutter it is not * or * than mrs stowe but then it is not written in the interests of philanthropy we had an unexpected dinnerparty today first wade hampton came and his wife then mr and mrs rose i remember that the late colonel hampton once said to me a thing i thought odd at the time mrs james rose and i forget now who was the other are the only two people on this side of the water who know how to give a state dinner mr and mrs james rose if anybody wishes to describe old carolina at its best let them try their hands at painting these two people wade hampton still * a little but he is rapidly recovering here is what he said and he has fought so well that he is listened to if we mean to play at war as we play a game of chess west point tactics prevailing we are sure to lose the game they have every advantage they can lose * ad * to the end of time and never feel it we will be throwing away all that we had hoped so much * * dash reckless gallantry spirit of adventure readiness to lead forlorn hopes mrs rose is miss sarah parkers aunt somehow it came out when i was not in the room but those girls tell me everything it seems miss sarah said the reason i can not bear mrs chesnut is that she laughs at everything and at everybody if she saw me now she would give me credit for some pretty hearty crying as well as laughing it was a mortifying thing to hear about ones self all the same general preston came in and announced that mr chesnut was in town he had just seen mr alfred huger who came up on the charleston train with him then mrs mccord came and offered to take me back to mrs mcmahans to look him up i found my room locked up lawrence said his master had gone to look for me at the prestons mrs mccord proposed we should further seek for my * husband at the door we met governor pickens who showed us telegrams from the president of the most important nature the governor added and i have one from jeems chesnut but i hear he has followed it so closely coming on its heels as it were that i need not show you that one you dont look interested at the sound of your husbands name said he is that his name asked i i supposed it was james my advice to you is to find him for mrs pickens says he was last seen in the company of two very handsome women and now you may call him any name you please we soon met the two beautiful dames governor pickens threw in my teeth were some ladies from * creek almost neighbors who live near camden by way of pleasant remark to wade hampton oh general the next battle will give you a chance to be majorgeneral i was very foolish to give up my legion he answered gloomily promotion dont really annoy many people mary gibson says her father writes to them that they may go back he thinks now that the confederates can hold richmond * in * another personal defeat little kate said oh cousin mary why dont you cultivate heart they say at * that you had better let your brains alone a while and cultivate heart she had evidently caught up a phrase and repeated it again and again for my benefit so that is the way they talk of me the only good of loving any one with your whole heart is to give that person the power to hurt you mr chesnut having missed the * fight by half a day was determined to see the one around richmond he went off with general cooper and wade hampton * duncan sent them for a luncheon on board the * wine and every manner of good thing in all this death and destruction the women are the * patter clatter oh the charleston refugees are so full of airs there is no sympathy for them here oh indeed that is queer they are not half as exclusive as these hamptons and prestons the airs these people do give themselves airs airs laughed mrs bartow * tennysons charge of the light brigade airs to the right of them airs to the left of them some one had blundered * and thundered rhymes but is out of place the worst of all airs came from a democratic landlady who was asked by mrs president davis to have a carpet shaken and shook herself with rage as she answered you know madam you need not stay here if my carpet or anything else does not suit you john chesnut gives us a spirited account of their ride around mcclellan i sent the letter to his grandfather the women ran out screaming with joyful welcome as soon as they caught sight of our soldiers gray uniforms ran to them bringing * and * of food one grayheaded man after preparing a hasty meal for them knelt and prayed as they snatched it as you may say they were in the saddle from friday until sunday they were used up so were their horses johnny writes for clothes and more horses miss s c says no need to send any more of his fine horses to be killed or captured by the yankees wait and see how the siege of richmond ends the horses will go all the same as johnny wants them i forgot to tell of mrs * reception for general hampton my mem dear described it all the governess * mem that is not the right name for * is not a teacher never mind it is the easier to say than the governors wife madame la * was suggested why that is worse than the other met him at the door took his crutch away putting his hand upon her shoulder instead that is the way to greet heroes she said her blue eyes were aflame and in response poor wade smiled and smiled until his face hardened into a fixed grin of embarrassment and annoyance he is a * man you know and does not want to be made much of by women the butler was not in plain clothes but wore as the other servants did magnificent livery brought from the court of st petersburg one mass of gold embroidery etc they had champagne and russian tea the latter from a * made in russia little moses was there now for us they have never put their servants into russian livery nor paraded little moses under our noses but i must confess the russian tea and champagne set before us left nothing to be desired how did general hampton bear his honors well to the last he looked as if he wished they would let him alone met mr * fresh from richmond he says stonewall is coming up behind mcclellan and here comes the tug of war he thinks we have so many spies in richmond they may have found out our strategic movements and so may * them mrs bartows story of a clever miss toombs so many men were in love with her and the * while it lasted of each one was as exciting and bewildering as a * she liked the fun of the run but she wanted something more than to know a man was in mad pursuit of her that he should love her she agreed but she must love him too how was she to tell yet she must be certain of it before she said yes so as they sat by the lamp she would look at him and inwardly ask herself would i be willing to spend the long winter evenings forever after sitting here darning your old stockings never echo answered no no a thousand times no so each had to make way for another we went in a body half a dozen ladies with no man on escort duty for they are all in the army to a concert mrs pickens came in she was joined soon by secretary moses and mr * doctor berrien came to our relief nothing could be more * than the singing financially the thing was a great success for though the audience was altogether feminine it was a very large one telegram from mr chesnut safe in richmond that is if richmond be safe with all the power of the united states of america * at her gates strange not a word from stonewall jackson after all doctor gibson telegraphs his wife stay where you are terrible battle looked for here decca is dead that poor little darling immediately after her baby was born she took it into her head that alex was killed he was wounded but those around had not told her of it she surprised them by asking does any one know how the battle has gone since alex was killed she could not read for a day or so before she died her head was bewildered but she would not let any one else touch her letters so she died with several unopened ones in her bosom mrs singleton deccas mother fainted dead away but she shed no tears we went to the house and saw alexs mother a daughter of langdon cheves annie was with us she said this is the saddest thing for alex no said his mother death is never the saddest thing if he were not a good man that would be a far worse thing annie in utter amazement * but alex is so good already yes seven years ago the death of one of his sisters that he dearly loved made him a christian that death in our family was worth a thousand lives one needs a hard heart now even old mr shand shed tears mary barnwell sat as still as a statue as white and stony grief which can relieve itself by tears is a thing to pray for said the rev mr shand then came a telegram from hampton all well so far we are successful robert barnwell had been telegraphed for his answer came cant leave here gregg is fighting across the chickahominy said alexs mother my son alex may never hear this sad news and her lip settled rigidly go on what else does hampton say asked she lee has one wing of the army stonewall the other annie hampton came to tell us the latest * we have abandoned james island and are fortifying morris island and now she says if the enemy will be so kind as to wait we will be ready for them in two months rev mr shand and that pious christian woman alexs mother who looks into your very soul with those large and lustrous blue eyes of hers agreed that the yankees even if they took charleston would not destroy it i think they will sinner that i am mr shand remarked to her madam you have two sons in the army alexs mother replied i have had six sons in the army i now have five there are people here too small to conceive of any larger business than quarreling in the newspapers one laughs at * in the papers now in such times as these with the wolf at our doors men safe in their closets writing fiery articles denouncing those who are at work are beneath contempt only critics with muskets on their shoulders have the right to speak now as trenholm said the other night in a pouring rain we went to that poor childs * deccas they buried her in the little white frock she wore when she engaged herself to alex and which she again put on for her bridal about a year ago she lies now in the churchyard in sight of my window is she to be pitied she said she had had months of perfect happiness how many people can say that so many of us live their long dreary lives and then happiness never comes to meet them at all it seems so near and yet it * them forever victory victory heads every telegram now one reads it on the bulletinboard it is the anniversary of the battle of fort moultrie the enemy went off so quickly i wonder if it was not a trap laid for us to lead us away from richmond to some place where they can manage to do us more harm and now comes the list of killed and wounded victory does not seem to soothe sore hearts mrs haskell has five sons before the enemys illimitable cannon mrs preston two mcclellan is routed and we have twelve thousand prisoners prisoners my god and what are we to do with them we cant feed our own people for the first time since joe johnston was wounded at seven pines we may breathe freely we were so afraid of another general or a new one stonewall can not be everywhere though he comes near it magruder did splendidly at big bethel it was a wonderful thing how he played his ten thousand before mcclellan like fireflies and utterly deluded him it was partly due to the manassas scare that we gave them they will never be * again now we are throwing up our caps for r e lee we hope from the lees what the first sprightly running at manassas could not give we do hope there will be no * * have ruined us shiloh was a victory if albert sidney johnston had not been killed seven pines if joe johnston had not been wounded the * * like * that victory at manassas did nothing but send us off in a fools paradise of conceit and it roused the manhood of the northern people for very shame they had to move up a french manofwar lies at the wharf at charleston to take off french subjects when the bombardment begins william * writes that the enemys gunboats are shelling and burning property up and down the * river they raise the white flag and the negroes rush down on them planters might as well have let these negroes be taken by the council to work on the fortifications a letter from my husband a telegram from my husband of june 29th from richmond was on the field saw it all things satisfying so far can hear nothing of john chesnut he is in stuarts command saw jack preston safe so far no reason why we should not bag mcclellans army or cut it to pieces from four to six thousand prisoners already doctor gibbes rushed in like a whirlwind to say we were driving mcclellan into the river first came dr trezevant who announced * rhetts death no no i have just seen the bulletinboard it was * rhetts when the doctor went out it was added howell * death is there too the doctor will see it as soon as he goes down to the board the girls went to see lucy trezevant the doctor was lying still as death on a sofa with his face covered no more news it has settled down into this the general battle the decisive battle has to be fought yet edward cheves only son of john cheves killed his sister kept crying oh mother what shall we do edward is killed but the mother sat dead still white as a sheet never uttering a word or shedding a tear are our women losing the capacity to weep the father came today mr john cheves he has been making infernal machines in charleston to blow up yankee ships while mrs mccord was telling me of this terrible trouble in her brothers family some one said deccas husband died of grief stuff and nonsense silly sentiment folly if he is not wounded he is alive his brother john may die of that shattered arm in this hot weather alex will never die of a broken heart take my word for it mem says she feels like sitting down as an irishwoman does at a wake and howling night and day why did huger let mcclellan slip through his fingers arrived at mrs mcmahans at the wrong moment mrs bartow was reading to the stricken mother an account of the death of her son the letter was written by a man who was standing by him when he was shot through the head my god he said that was all and he fell dead james taylor was colorbearer he was shot three times before he gave in then he said as he handed the colors to the man next him you see i cant stand it any longer and dropped stone dead he was only seventeen years old if anything can reconcile me to the idea of a horrid failure after all efforts to make good our independence of yankees it is lincolns proclamation freeing the negroes especially yours messieurs who write insults to your governor and council dated from * three hundred of mr walter * negroes have gone to the yankees remember that recalcitrant patriots property on two legs may walk off without an order from the council to work on fortifications have been reading the * papers by curtis can this be a picture of new york * if it were not for this horrid war how nice it would be here we might lead such a pleasant life this is the most perfectly appointed * beautiful grounds flowers and fruits indeed all that heart could wish such delightful dinners such pleasant drives such jolly talks such charming people but this horrid war * everything drove out with mrs constitution browne who told us the story of ben * devotion to lucy * poor ben * dead hero called at the tognos and saw no one no wonder they say * * was to have been married to * rhett in august and he is dead on the battlefield i had not heard of the engagement before i went there gunboat captured on the * so much the worse for us we do not want any more prisoners and next time they will send a fleet of boats if one will not do the governor sent me mr chesnuts telegram with a note saying i regret the telegram does not come up to what we had hoped might be as to the entire destruction of mcclellans army i think however the strength of the war with its ferocity may now be considered as broken tabletalk today this war was undertaken by us to shake off the yoke of foreign invaders so we consider our cause righteous the yankees since the war has begun have discovered it is to free the slaves that they are fighting so their cause is noble they also expect to make the war pay yankees do not undertake anything that does not pay they think we belong to them we have been good milk * by the tariff or skimmed we let them have all of our hard earnings we bear the ban of slavery they get the money cotton pays everybody who handles it sells it manufactures it but rarely pays the man who grows it second hand the yankees received the wages of slavery they grew rich we grew poor the * is as bad as the thief that applies to us too for we received the savages they stole from africa and brought to us in their * as with the egyptians so it shall be with us if they let us go it must be across a red * one made red by blood my husband has come he believes from what he heard in richmond that we are to be recognized as a nation by the crowned heads across the water at last mr davis was very kind he asked him to stay at his house which he did and went every day with general lee and mr davis to the battlefield as a sort of amateur aide to the president likewise they admitted him to the informal cabinet meetings at the presidents house he is so hopeful now that it is pleasant to hear him and i had not the heart to stick the small pins of * and pickens in him yet a while public opinion is hot against huger and magruder for mcclellans escape doctor gibbes gave me some letters picked up on the battlefield one signed laura tells her lover to fight in such a manner that no southerner can ever taunt yankees again with cowardice she speaks of a man at home whom she knows who is still talking of his intention to seek the bubble reputation at the cannons mouth miserable coward she writes i will never speak to him again it was a relief to find one silly young person filling three pages with a description of her new bonnet and the bonnet still worn by her rival those fiery * of arc * who goad on their sweethearts * us no good rachel lyons was in richmond hand in glove with mrs greenhow why not so handsome so clever so * kind says rachel of the greenhow and she offers to * me mrs philips another beautiful and clever * has been put into prison again by beast butler because she happened to be laughing as a yankee funeral procession went by captain b told of john chesnuts * johnny was riding a powerful horse captured from the yankees the horse dashed with him right into the yankee ranks a dozen confederates galloped after him shouting stuart stuart the yankees mistaking this mad charge for stuarts cavalry broke ranks and fled daredevil camden boys ride like arabs mr chesnut says he was riding with the president when colonel browne his aide was along the general commanding rode up and bowing politely said mr president am i in command here yes then i forbid you to stand here under the enemys guns any exposure of a life like yours is wrong and this is useless exposure you must go back mr davis answered certainly i will set an example of obedience to orders discipline must be maintained but he did not go back mr chesnut met the haynes who had gone on to nurse their wounded son and found him dead they were standing in the corridor of the spotswood although mr chesnut was staying at the presidents he retained his room at the hotel so he gave his room to them next day when he went back to his room he found that mrs hayne had thrown herself across the foot of the bed and never moved no other part of the bed had been touched she got up and went back to the cars or was led back he says these heartbroken mothers are hard to face at mcmahans our small colonel paul haynes son came into my room to amuse the child i gave him a photograph album to look over you have lincoln in your book said he i am astonished at you i hate him and he placed the book on the floor and struck old abe in the face with his fist an englishman told me lincoln has said that had he known such a war would follow his election he never would have set foot in washington nor have been inaugurated he had never dreamed of this awful fratricidal bloodshed that does not seem like the true john brown spirit i was very glad to hear * hear something from the president of the united states which was not merely a vulgar joke and usually a joke so vulgar that you were ashamed to laugh funny though it was they say seward has gone to england and his wily tongue will turn all hearts against us browne told us there was a son of the duke of somerset in richmond he laughed his fill at our ragged dirty soldiers but he stopped his laughing when he saw them under fire our men strip the yankee dead of their shoes but will not touch the shoes of a comrade poor fellows they are nearly barefoot alex has come i saw him ride up about dusk and go into the graveyard i shut up my windows on that side poor fellow halcott green came to see us bragg is a stern * according to halcott he did not in the least understand citizen soldiers in the retreat from shiloh he ordered that not a gun should be fired a soldier shot a chicken and then the soldier was shot for a chicken said halcott a confederate soldier for a chicken mrs mccord says a nurse who is also a beauty had better leave her beauty with her cloak and hat at the door one lovely lady nurse said to a rough old soldier whose wound could not have been dangerous well my good soul what can i do for you kiss me said he mrs mccords fury was at the womans telling it for it brought her hospital into * and very properly she knew there were women who would boast of an insult if it ministered to their vanity she wanted nurses to come dressed as nurses as sisters of charity and not as fine ladies then there would be no trouble when she saw them coming in angel sleeves displaying all their white arms and in their muslin showing all their beautiful white shoulders and throats she felt disposed to order them off the premises that was no proper costume for a nurse mrs bartow goes in her widows weeds which is after mrs mccords own heart but mrs bartow has her stories too a surgeon said to her i give you no detailed instructions a mother necessarily is a nurse she then passed on quietly as smilingly * my dear as if i had ever been a mother mrs greenhow has enlightened rachel lyons as to mr chesnuts character in washington he was one of the very few men of whom there was not a word of scandal spoken i do not believe my dear that he ever spoke to a woman there he did know mrs john r thompson however walked up and down the college campus with mrs mccord the buildings all lit up with gas the soldiers seated under the elms in every direction and in every stage of convalescence through the open windows could see the nurses flitting about it was a strange weird scene walked home with mrs bartow we stopped at judge carrolls mrs carroll gave us a cup of tea when we got home found the prestons had called for me to dine at their house to meet general magruder last night the edgefield band serenaded governor pickens mrs harris stepped on the porch and sang the * for them it has been more than twenty years since i first heard her voice it was a very fine one then but there is nothing which the tooth of time * more cruelly than the singing voice of women there is an * * for you the negroes on the coast received the rutledges mounted rifles apparently with great * the troops were gratified to find the negroes in such a friendly state of mind one servant whispered to his master dont you mind em dont trust * the negroes the master then dressed himself as a federal officer and went down to a negro quarter the very first greeting was * massa you come * ketch rebels we kin show you way you kin ketch thirty tonight they took him to the confederate camp or pointed it out and then added for his edification we kin ketch officer * you whenever you want em bad news gunboats have passed vicksburg the yankees are spreading themselves over our fair southern land like red * jackson has gone into the enemys country joe johnston and wade hampton are to follow think of rice mr senator rice who sent us the * i see from his place in the senate that he speaks of us as savages who put powder and whisky into soldiers canteens to make them mad with ferocity in the fight no never we admire coolness here because we lack it we do not need to be fired by drink to be brave my classical lore is small indeed but i faintly remember something of the * who marched to the music of * no drum and fife were needed to revive their fainting spirits in that one thing we are * the wayside hospital is duly established at the columbia station where all the railroads meet all honor to mrs fisher and the other women who work there so faithfully the young girls of columbia started this hospital in the first winter of the war * soldiers sick and wounded suffered greatly when they had to lie over here because of faulty connections between trains rev mr martin whose habit it was to meet trains and offer his aid to these unfortunates suggested to the young ladies hospital association their opportunity straightway the blessed maidens provided a room where our poor fellows might have their wounds bound up and be refreshed and now the soldiers rest has grown into the wayside hospital and older heads and hands relieve younger ones of the * work and graver responsibilities i am ready to help in every way by subscription and otherwise but too feeble in health to go there much mrs browne heard a man say at the congaree house we are breaking our heads against a stone wall we are bound to be conquered we can not keep it up much longer against so powerful a nation as the united states crowds of irish dutch and scotch are pouring in to swell their armies they are promised our lands and they believe they will get them even if we are successful we can not live without yankees now says mrs browne i call that man a yankee spy to which i reply if he were a spy he would not dare show his hand so plainly to think says mrs browne that he is not taken up sewards little bell would tinkle a guard would come and the grand inquisition of america would order that man put under arrest in the twinkling of an eye if he had ventured to speak against yankees in yankee land general preston said he had the right to take up any one who was not in his right place and send him where he belonged then do take up my husband instantly he is sadly out of his right place in this little governors council the general stared at me and slowly uttered in his most tragic tones if i could put him where i think he ought to be this i immediately hailed as a high compliment and was duly ready with my thanks upon reflection it is borne in upon me that he might have been more explicit he left too much to the imagination then mrs browne described the prince of wales whose manners it seems differ from those of mrs who arraigned us from morn to dewy eve and upbraided us with our * manners and customs the prince when he was here conformed at once to whatever he saw was the way of those who entertained him he closely imitated president buchanans way of doing things he took off his gloves at once when he saw that the president wore none he began by bowing to the people who were presented to him but when he saw mr buchanan shaking hands he shook hands too when smoking * with browne on the white house piazza he expressed his content with the fine cigars browne had given him the president said i was keeping some excellent ones for you but browne has got ahead of me long after mr buchanan had gone to bed the prince ran into his room in a jolly boyish way and said mr buchanan i have come for the fine cigars you have for me as i walked up to the prestons along a beautiful shaded back street a carriage passed with governor means in it as soon as he saw me he threw himself half out and kissed both hands to me again and again it was a * greeting as the saying is and i returned it with my whole heart too goodby he cried and i responded goodby i may never see him again i am not sure that i did not shed a few tears general preston and mr chesnut were seated on the piazza of the hampton house as i walked in i opened my batteries upon them in this scornful style you cold formal solemn * creatures weighed down by your own dignity you will never know the rapture of such a sad farewell as john means and i have just * he was in a hack i proceeded to relate and i was on the sidewalk he was on his way to the war poor fellow the * drove steadily along in the middle of the street but for our gray hairs i do not know what he might have thought of us john means did not suppress his feelings at an unexpected meeting with an old friend and a good cry did me good it is a life of terror and foreboding we lead my heart is in my mouth half the time but you two under no possible circumstances could you forget your manners read russells india all day saintly folks those english when their blood is up * and blacks we do not expect anything better from but what an example of christian patience and humanity the white angels from the west set them the beautiful * rachel lyons was here today she flattered paul hayne * and he threw back the ball today i saw the * to this rebecca when mrs edward barnwell called she is the purest type of * beautiful cold quiet calm ladylike fair as a lily with the blackest and longest eyelashes and her eyes so light in color some one said they were the hue of cologne and water at any rate she has a patent right to them there are no more like them to be had the effect is startling but lovely beyond words * duncan told us a story of morgan in kentucky morgan walked into a court where they were trying some secessionists the judge was about to pronounce sentence but morgan rose and begged that he might be allowed to call some witnesses the judge asked who were his witnesses my name is john morgan and my witnesses are # confederate soldiers mrs izard witnessed two instances of patriotism in the caste called sandhill * one forlorn chill and * creature yellow dirty and dry as a nut was selling peaches at ten cents a dozen soldiers collected around her cart she took the cover off and cried eat away eat your fill i never charge our soldiers anything they tried to make her take pay but when she steadily refused it they cheered her madly and said sleep in peace now we will fight for you and keep off the yankees another poor sandhill man refused to sell his cows and gave them to the hospital * rock n c august 1 #* ill i left mrs mcmahans for flat rock it was very hot and disagreeable for an invalid in a boardinghouse in that climate the la * and the mccord girls came part of the way with me the cars were crowded and a lame soldier had to stand leaning on his crutches in the thoroughfare that runs between the seats one of us gave him our seat you may depend upon it there was no trouble in finding a seat for our party after that dr la * quoted a classic anecdote in some greek assembly an old man was left standing a spartan gave him his seat the * cheered madly though they had kept their seats the comment was * practise virtue * know how to admire it nathan davis happened accidentally to be at the station at greenville he took immediate charge of molly and myself for my party had dwindled to us two he went with us to the hotel sent for the landlord told him who i was secured good rooms for us and saw that we were made comfortable in every way at dinner i entered that immense diningroom alone but i saw friends and acquaintances on every side my first exploit was to repeat to mrs ives mrs * blunder in taking a suspicious attitude toward men born at the north and calling upon general cooper to agree with her martha levy explained the grave faces of my auditors by saying that colonel ives was a new * my distress was dire louisa hamilton was there she told me that captain george cuthbert with his arm in a sling from a wound by no means healed was going to risk the shaking of a stagecoach he was on his way to his cousin william cuthberts at flat rock now george cuthbert is a type of the finest kind of southern soldier we can not make them any better than he is before the war i knew him he traveled in europe with my sister kate and mary withers at once i offered him a seat in the comfortable hack nathan davis had engaged for me molly sat opposite to me and often when i was tired held my feet in her lap captain cuthberts man sat with the driver we had ample room we were a dilapidated company i was so ill i could barely sit up and captain cuthbert could not use his right hand or arm at all i had to draw his match light his cigar etc he was very quiet grateful gentle and i was going to say docile he is a fiery soldier one of those whose whole face becomes * in battle so one of his men told me describing his way with his company he does not blow his own trumpet but i made him tell me the story of his duel with the * reporter he seemed awfully ashamed of wasting time in such a scrape that night we stopped at a country house halfway toward our journeys end there we met mr charles lowndes * lowndes his son is with wade hampton first we drove by mistake into judge kings yard our * mistaking the place for the hotel then we made farmers hotel as the * men say * rhett with his steed was at the door horse and man were * with as much red and gold artillery uniform as they could bear he held his horse the stirrups were mexican i believe they looked like little * seeing his friend and * george cuthbert alight and leave a veiled lady in the carriage this handsome and undismayed young * walked round and round the carriage talked with the driver looked in at the doors and at the front suddenly i bethought me to raise my veil and satisfy his curiosity our eyes met and i smiled it was impossible to resist the comic disappointment on his face when a woman old enough to be george cuthberts mother with the ravages of a year of * fever almost fainting with fatigue greeted his vision he instantly mounted his gallant steed and * away to his fiance he is to marry the greatest heiress in the state miss aiken then captain cuthbert told me his name at kates i found sally rutledge and then for weeks life was a blank i remember nothing the illness which had been creeping on for so long a time took me by the throat at greenville i had met many friends i witnessed the * of barny heyward once the husband of the lovely lucy izard now a widower and a bon * he was there nursing joe his brother so was the beautiful * magruder heyward now a widow for poor joe died there is something magnetic in * * large and lustrous black eyes no man has ever resisted their influence she says her virgin heart has never beat one throb the faster for any mortal here * now when it * to barny well as i said joseph heyward died and rapidly did the bereaved beauty shake the dust of this poor confederacy from her feet and plume her wings for flight across the water let me insert here now much later all i know of that brave spirit george cuthbert while i was living in the winter of 1863 at the corner of clay and twelfth streets in richmond he came to see me never did man enjoy life more the preston girls were staying at my house then and it was very gay for the young soldiers who ran down from the army for a day or so we had heard of him as usual gallantly facing odds at sharpsburg and he asked if he should chance to be wounded would i have him brought to clay street he was shot at chancellorsville leading his men the surgeon did not think him mortally wounded he sent me a message that he was coming at once to our house he knew he would soon get well there also that i need not be alarmed those yankees could not kill me he asked one of his friends to write a letter to his mother afterward he said he had another letter to write but that he wished to sleep first he felt so exhausted at his request they then turned his face away from the light and left him when they came again to look at him they found him dead he had been dead for a long time it was bitter cold wounded men lost much blood and were weakened in that way they lacked warm blankets and all comforts many died who might have been saved by one good hot drink or a few * of * food one of the generals said to me fire and reckless courage like captain cuthberts are contagious such men in an army are invaluable losses like this weakened us indeed but i must not linger longer around the memory of the bravest of the * true * of our old rgime gallant gay * b c august #* daniel * drove down to my sisters in his heavy substantial english phaeton with stout and strong horses to match i went back with him and spent two delightful days at his hospitable mansion i met there as a sort of chaplain the rev mr he dealt * by me we had a long argument and when we knelt down for evening prayers he introduced an * prayer and prayed for me most palpably there was i down on my knees redhot with rage and fury david w said it was a clear case of * a fellow when he was down afterward the fun of it all struck me and i found it difficult to keep from shaking with laughter it was not an edifying religious exercise to say the least as far as i was concerned before chancellorsville was fatal sharpsburg my friend colonel means killed on the battlefield his only son stark wounded and a prisoner his wife had not recovered from the death of her other child emma who had died of consumption early in the war she was lying on a bed when they told her of her husbands death and then they tried to keep * condition from her they think now that she misunderstood and believed him dead too she threw something over her face she did not utter one word she remained quiet so long some one removed the light shawl which she had thrown over her head and found she was dead miss mary stark her sister said afterward no wonder how was she to face life without her husband and children that was all she had ever lived for these are sad unfortunate memories let us run away from them what has not my husband been doing this year 1862 when all our south carolina troops are in virginia here we were without soldiers or arms he raised an army so to speak and imported arms through the trenholm firm he had arms to sell to the confederacy he laid the foundation of a * and the confederacy sent to columbia to learn of professor le conte how to begin theirs he bought up all the old arms and had them altered and repaired he built ships he imported clothes and shoes for our soldiers for which things they had long stood sorely in need he imported cotton cards and set all idle hands * and weaving all the world was set to spinning cotton he tried to stop the sale of whisky and alas he called for * is men over age and he committed the * offense of sending the sacred negro property to work on fortifications away from their owners plantations * ala july 8 #* mother ill at her home on the plantation near * i have come to see her but to go back first to my trip home from flat rock to camden at the station i saw men sitting on a row of coffins smoking talking and laughing with their feet drawn up * to keep them out of the wet thus does war * peoples hearts met james chesnut at wilmington he only crossed the river with me and then went back to richmond he was violently opposed to sending our troops into pennsylvania wanted all we could spare sent west to make an end there of our enemies he kept dark about * i am sure we could not trust him to do us any good or to do the yankees any harm the coriolanus business is played out as we came to camden molly sat by me in the cars she touched me and with her nose in the air said look missis there was the inevitable bride and * least so i * the irrepressible kissing and * against each other which i had seen so often before i was rather astonished at mollys * but there was a touch in this scene which was new the man required for his peace of mind that the girl should brush his cheek with those beautiful long eyelashes of hers molly became so outraged in her * modesty that she kept her head out of the window not to see when we were detained at a little wayside station this woman made an awful row about her room she seemed to know me and appealed to me said her brotherinlaw was adjutant to colonel k etc molly observed you had better go yonder maam where your husband is calling you the woman drew herself up proudly and with a toss exclaimed husband indeed im a widow that is my cousin i loved my dear husband too well to marry again ever ever absolutely tears came into her eyes molly loaded as she was with shawls and bundles stood motionless and said after all that * in the * o lord i should a let it go twas my husband and me nigger as i am here i was at home on a soft bed with every physical comfort but life is one long catechism there due to the curiosity of * people in a narrow world in richmond molly and lawrence quarreled he declared he could not put up with her * unfortunately i asked him in the interests of peace and a quiet house to bear with her temper i did said i but she was so good and useful he was shabby enough to tell her what i had said at their next quarrel the awful reproaches she overwhelmed me with then she said she was mortified that i had humbled her before lawrence but the day of her revenge came at negro balls in richmond guests were required to carry passes and in changing his coat lawrence forgot his pass next day lawrence was missing and molly came to me laughing to tears come and look said she here is the fine gentleman tied between two black niggers and marched off to jail she laughed and jeered so she could not stand without holding on to the window lawrence disregarded her and called to me at the top of his voice please maam ask mars jeems to come take me out of this i aint done * as soon as mr chesnut came home i told him of * sad fall and he went at once to his rescue there had been a fight and a disturbance at the ball the police had been called in and when every negro was required to show his pass lawrence had been taken up as having none he was terribly * when he came home walking behind mr chesnut he is always so respectable and * and stands on his dignity i went over to mrs prestons at columbia camden had become simply intolerable to me there the telegram found me saying i must go to my mother who was ill at her home here in alabama colonel goodwyn his wife and two daughters were going and so i joined the party i telegraphed mr chesnut for lawrence and he replied forbidding me to go at all it was so hot the cars so disagreeable fever would be the inevitable result miss kate hampton in her soft voice said the only trouble in life is when one cant decide in which way duty leads once know your duty then all is easy i do not know whether she thought it my duty to obey my husband but i thought it my duty to go to my mother as i risked nothing but myself we had two days of an exciting drama under our very noses before our eyes a party had come to columbia who said they had run the blockade had come in by flag of truce etc colonel goodwyn asked me to look around and see if i could pick out the suspected crew it was easily done we were all in a sadly * condition we had come to the end of our good clothes in three years and now our only resource was to turn them upside down or inside out and in mending darning * etc near me on the train to alabama sat a young woman in a traveling dress of bright yellow she wore a profusion of curls had pink cheeks was delightfully airy and easy in her manner and was absorbed in a flirtation with a confederate major who in spite of his nice new gray uniform and two stars had a very yankee face fresh * sharp utterly * florid wholesome handsome what more in compliment can one say of ones enemies two other women faced this man and woman and we knew them to be newcomers by their good clothes one of these women was a german she it was who had betrayed them i found that out afterward the handsomest of the three women had a hard northern face but all were in splendid array as to feathers flowers lace and jewelry if they were spies why were they so foolish as to brag of new york and compare us * with the other side all the time and in loud shrill accents surely that was not the way to pass unnoticed in the confederacy a man came in stood up and read from a paper the surrender of vicksburg i felt as if i had been struck a hard blow on the top of my head and my heart took one of its queer turns i was utterly unconscious not long i dare say the first thing i heard was exclamations of joy and exultation from the * party my rage and humiliation were great a man within * of this party had slept through everything he had a greyhound face eager and inquisitive when awake but now he was as one of the seven sleepers colonel goodwyn wrote on a blank page of my book one of de * note is there now that the sleeper was a richmond detective finally hot and tired out we arrived at west point on the * river the dusty cars were quite still except for the * flirtation of the yellow gown and her major two confederate officers walked in i felt mischief in the air one touched the smart major who was whispering to yellow gown the major turned quickly instantly every drop of blood left his face a spasm seized his throat it was a piteous sight and at once i was awfully sorry for him he was marched out of the car poor yellow gowns color was fast but the whites of her eyes were lurid of the three women spies we never heard again they never do anything worse to women the highminded confederates than send them out of the country but when we read soon afterward of the execution of a male spy we thought of the major at montgomery the boat waited for us and in my haste i tumbled out of the omnibus with dr robert johnsons assistance but nearly broke my neck the thermometer was high up in the * and they gave me a stateroom over the boiler i paid out my confederate rags of money freely to the maid in order to get out of that * surely go where we may hereafter an alabama steamer in august lying under the bluff with the sun looking down will give one a foretaste almost an adequate idea of whats to come as far as heat goes the planks of the floor burned ones feet under the bluff at selma where we stayed nearly all * do not know why met james boykin who had lost # bales of cotton at vicksburg and charged it all to jeff davis in his wrath which did not seem exactly reasonable to me at portland there was a horse for james boykin and he rode away promising to have a carriage sent for me at once but he had to go seven miles on horseback before he reached my sister sallys and then sally was to send back on that lonely * molly and i remained with dismal swamps on every side and immense plantations the white people few or none in my heart i knew my husband was right when he forbade me to undertake this journey there was one living thing at this little * * white man who had a store opposite and oh how drunk he was hot as it was molly kept up a fire of pine knots there was neither lamp nor candle in that deserted house the drunken man reeled over now and then lantern in hand he would stand with his idiotic drunken glare or go solemnly staggering round us but always bowing in his politeness he nearly fell over us but i sprang out of his way as he asked well madam what can i do for you shall i ever forget the headache of that night and the fright my temples throbbed with dumb misery i sat upon a chair molly on the floor with her head resting against my chair she was as near as she could get to me and i kept my hand on her missis said she now i do believe you are scared scared of that poor drunken thing if he was sober i could whip him in a fair fight and drunk as he is i kin throw him over the banister ef he so much as * you i dont value him a button taking heart from such brave words i laughed it seemed an eternity but the carriage came by ten oclock and then with the coachman as our sole protector we poor women drove eight miles or more over a carriage road through long lanes swamps of * darkness with plantations on every side the house as we drew near looked like a graveyard in a nightmare so vague and * were its outlines i found my mother ill in bed feeble still but better than i hoped to see her i knew you would come was her greeting with outstretched hands then i went to bed in that silent house a house of the dead it seemed i supposed i was not to see my sister until the next day but she came in some time after i had gone to bed she kissed me quietly without a tear she was thin and pale but her voice was calm and kind as she lifted the candle over her head to show me something on the wall i saw that her pretty brown hair was white it was awfully hard not to burst out into violent weeping she looked so sweet and yet so utterly brokenhearted but as she was without emotion apparently it would not become me to upset her by my tears next day at noon hetty mothers old maid brought my breakfast to my bedside such a breakfast it was * could do no better it is ever so late i know to which hetty replied yes we would not let molly wake you what a splendid cook you have here my daughter * is miss sallys cook shes well enough as times go but when our miss mary comes to see us i does it myself and she courtesied down to the floor bless your old soul i cried and she rushed over and gave me a good hug she is my mothers * has been her maid since she was six years old when she was bought from a virginia * along with her own mother and all her brothers and sisters she has been pampered until she is a rare old tyrant at times she can do everything better than any one else and my mother * on her heavily hetty is * wife dick is the butler they have over a dozen children and take life very easily sally came in before i was out of bed and began at once in the same stony way pale and cold as ice to tell me of the death of her children it had happened not two weeks before her eyes were utterly without life no expression whatever and in a composed and sad sort of manner she told the tale as if it were something she had read and wanted me to hear my eldest daughter mary had grown up to be a lovely girl she was between thirteen and fourteen you know baby kate had my sisters gray eyes she was evidently to be the beauty of the family strange it is that here was one of my children who has lived and has gone and you have never seen her at all she died first and i would not go to the funeral i thought it would kill me to see her put under the ground i was lying down stupid with grief when aunt charlotte came to me after the funeral with this news mary has that awful disease too there was nothing to say i got up and dressed instantly and went to mary i did not leave her side again in that long struggle between life and death i did everything for her with my own hands i even prepared my darling for the grave i went to her funeral and i came home and walked straight to my mother and i begged her to be comforted i would bear it all without one word if god would only spare me the one child left me now sally has never shed a tear but has grown twenty years older cold hard careworn with the same rigidity of manner she began to go over all the details of marys illness i had not given up hope no not at all as i sat by her side she said mamma put your hand on my knees they are so cold i put my hand on her knee the cold struck to my heart i knew it was the coldness of death sally put out her hand on me and it seemed to recall the feeling she fell forward in an agony of weeping that lasted for hours the doctor said this reaction was a blessing without it she must have died or gone mad while the mother was so bitterly weeping the little girl the last of them a bright child of three or four crawled into my bed now auntie she whispered i want to tell you all about mamie and katie but they watch me so they say i must never talk about them katie died because she ate blackberries i know that and then aunt charlotte read mamie a letter and that made her die too maum hetty says they have gone to god but i know the people saved a place between them in the ground for me uncle william was in despair at the low ebb of patriotism out here west of the savannah river said he it is property first life next honor last he gave me an excellent pair of shoes what a gift for more than a year i have had none but some dreadful things * makes for me and they hurt my feet so these do not fit but that is nothing they are large enough and do not pinch anywhere i have absolutely a respectable pair of shoes uncle william says the men who went into the war to save their negroes are * wretched neither side now cares a fig for these beloved negroes and would send them all to heaven in a * as custis lee says to win in the fight general lee and mr davis want the negroes put into the army mr chesnut and major venable discussed the subject one night but would they fight on our side or desert to the enemy they dont go to the enemy because they are comfortable as they are and expect to be free anyway when we were children our nurses used to give us tea out in the open air on little pine tables * as clean as * sometimes as dick would pass us with his slow and * step we would call out do dick come and wait on us no little * i never wait on pine tables wait till you get big enough to put your legs under your pas mahogany i taught him to read as soon as i could read myself perched on his * he wont look at me now but looks over my head * freedom in the air he was always very ambitious i do not think he ever troubled himself much about books but then as my father said dick standing in front of his sideboard has heard all subjects in earth or heaven discussed and by the best heads in our world he is proud too in his way hetty his wife complained that the other men servants looked finer in their livery nonsense old woman a butler never * himself to wear livery he is always in plain clothes somewhere he had picked that up he is the first negro in whom i have felt a change others go about in their black * not a ripple or an emotion showing and yet on all other subjects except the war they are the most excitable of all races now dick might make a very respectable egyptian sphinx so * silent is he he did deign to inquire about general richard anderson he was my young master once said he i always will like him better than anybody else when dick married hetty the anderson house was next door the two families agreed to sell either dick or hetty whichever consented to be sold hetty refused outright and the andersons sold dick that he might be with his wife this was magnanimous on the andersons part for hetty was only a * and dick was a trained butler on whom mrs anderson had spent no end of pains in his diningroom education and of course if they had refused to sell dick hetty would have had to go to them mrs anderson was very much disgusted with * ingratitude when she found he was willing to leave them as a butler he is a treasure he is overwhelmed with dignity but that does not interfere with his work at all my father had a bodyservant simon who could imitate his masters voice perfectly he would sometimes call out from the yard after my father had mounted his horse dick bring me my overcoat i see you there sir hurry up when dick hastened out overcoat in hand and only simon was visible after several obsequious yes marster just as marster pleases my mother had always to step out and prevent a fight dick never forgave her laughing once in sumter when my father was very busy preparing a law case the mob in the street annoyed him and he grumbled about it as simon was making up his fire suddenly he heard as it were himself speaking the hon s d * miller as the colored gentleman announced himself in the * to the gentlemen outside to go away and leave a lawyer in peace to prepare his case for the next day my father said he could have sworn the sound was that of his own voice the crowd dispersed but some noisy negroes came along and upon them simon rushed with the * whip slashing around in the dark calling himself lawyer miller who was determined to have peace simon returned complaining that them niggers run so he never got in a hundred yards of one of them at portland we met a man who said is it not strange that in this poor devoted land of ours there are some men who are making money by blockaderunning * our embarrassed government and skulking the fight coming on here from portland there was no stateroom for me my mother alone had one my aunt and i sat nodding in * for the floors and sofas were covered with sleepers too on the floor that night so hot that even a little covering of clothes could not be borne lay a motley crew black white and yellow * themselves in * array children and their nurses bared to the view were wrapped in the profoundest slumber no caste prejudices were here neither garrison john brown nor * smith ever dreamed of equality more untrammeled a * enormously fat negro man * in every now and then to look after the lamps the atmosphere of that cabin was stifling and the sight of those figures on the floor did not make it more tolerable so we soon escaped and sat out near the guards the next day was the very hottest i have ever known one supreme consolation was the * the very finest and the ice a very handsome woman whom i did not know rehearsed all our disasters in the field and then as if she held me responsible she faced me furiously and where are our big men whom do you mean i mean our leaders the men we have a right to look to to save us they got us into this scrape let them get us out of it where are our big men i sympathized with her and understood her but i answered lightly i do not know the exact size you want them here in montgomery we have been so hospitably received ye gods how those women talked and all at the same time they put me under the care of general dick taylors brotherinlaw a mr gordon who married one of the * a very pleasant arrangement it was for me he was kind and attentive and vastly agreeable with his new orleans anecdotes on the first of last january all his servants left him but four to these faithful few he gave free papers at once that they might lose naught by loyalty should the confederates come into authority once more he paid high wages and things worked smoothly for some weeks one day his wife saw some yankee officers cards on a table and said to her maid i did not know any of these people had called oh missis the maid replied they come to see me and i have been waiting to tell you it is too hard i can not do it i can not dance with those nice gentlemen at night at our union balls and then come here and be your servant the next day i cant so said mr gordon freedom must be followed by fraternity and equality one by one the faithful few slipped away and the family were left to their own devices why not when general dick taylors place was sacked his negroes moved down to * a village near new orleans an old woman came to mr gordon to say that these negroes wanted him to get word to mars dick that they were dying of disease and starvation thirty had died that day dick taylors help being out of the question mr gordon applied to a federal officer he found this one not a philanthropist but a cynic who said all right it is working out as i expected improve negroes and indians off the continent their strong men we put in the army the rest will disappear joe johnston can * as he is sent west he says they may give lee the army joe johnston trained lee is reaping where he sowed he thinks but then he was backing straight through richmond when they stopped his retreating ichmond va august 10 #* i had a letter from my sister who wrote to inquire about her old playmate friend and lover boykin * it is nearly twenty years since each was married each now has children nearly grown to tell the truth she writes in these last dreadful years with david in florida where i can not often hear from him and everything dismal anxious and * i had almost forgotten boykins existence but he came here last night he stood by my bedside and spoke to me kindly and affectionately as if we had just parted i said holding out my hand boykin you are very pale he answered i have come to tell you goodby and then seized both my hands his own hands were as cold and hard as ice they froze the marrow of my bones i screamed again and again until my whole household came rushing in and then came the negroes from the yard all wakened by my piercing shrieks this may have been a dream but it haunts me some one sent me an old paper with an account of his wounds and his recovery but i know he is dead stop said my husband at this point and then he read from that days examiner these words captain burwell boykin * found dead upon the battlefield leading a cavalry charge at the head of his company he was shot through the head the famous colonel of the fourth texas by name john bell hood is * we call sam because his classmates at west point did * what cause is not known john darby asked if he might bring his hero to us * of him extensively said he had won his three stars etc under stonewalls eye and that he was promoted by stonewalls request when hood came with his sad * face the face of an old * who believed in his cause his cross and his crown we were not prepared for such a man as a beauideal of the wild texans he is tall thin and shy has blue eyes and light hair a tawny beard and a vast amount of it covering the lower part of his face the whole appearance that of awkward strength some one said that his great reserve of manner he carried only into the society of ladies major venable added that he had often heard of the light of battle shining in a mans eyes he had seen it * he carried to hood orders from lee and found in the hottest of the fight that the man was * the fierce light of hoods eyes i can never forget hood came to ask us to a picnic next day at drurys bluff the naval heroes were to receive us and then we were to drive out to the texan camp we accused john darby of having instigated this unlookedfor * we were to have bands of music and dances with turkeys chickens and * tongues to eat next morning just as my foot was on the * the girls standing behind ready to follow me with johnny and the infant samuel captain shannon by proper name up rode john darby in redhot haste threw his bridle to one of the men who was holding the horses and came toward us rapidly clanking his cavalry spurs with a despairing sound as he cried stop its all up we are ordered back to the rappahannock the brigade is marching through richmond now so we unpacked and * dismissed the * and sat down with a sigh suppose we go and see them pass the turnpike some one said the suggestion was hailed with delight and off we marched johnny and the infant were in citizens clothes and the * hood calls john darby since the prestons have been in * all * and plumed in his surgeons array he never * an inch of * or a feather he was courting and he stalked ahead with mary preston buck and johnny the infant and myself both stout and scant of breath lagged last they called back to us as the infant came * along hurry up or we will leave you at the turnpike we stood on the sidewalk and saw ten thousand men march by we had seen nothing like this before hitherto we had seen only regiments marching * and span in their fresh smart clothes just from home and on their way to the army such rags and * as we saw now nothing was like anything else most garments and arms were such as had been taken from the enemy such shoes as they had on oh our brave boys moaned buck such tin pans and pots as were tied to their waists with bread or bacon stuck on the ends of their bayonets anything that could be spiked was * and held aloft they did not seem to mind their shabby condition they laughed shouted and cheered as they marched by not a disrespectful or light word was spoken but they went for the men who were huddled behind us and who seemed to be trying to make themselves as small as possible in order to escape observation hood and his staff finally came galloping up dismounted and joined us mary preston gave him a bouquet thereupon he unwrapped a bible which he carried in his pocket he said his mother had given it to him he pressed a flower in it mary preston suggested that he had not worn or used it at all being fresh new and beautifully kept every word of this the texans heard as they marched by almost touching us they laughed and joked and made their own rough comments major edward johnston did not get into the confederacy until after the first battle of manassas for some cause before he could evade that * seward rang his little bell and sent him to a prison in the harbor of new york i forget whether he was exchanged or escaped of his own motion the next thing i heard of my antebellum friend he had defeated milroy in western virginia there were so many johnstons that for this victory they named him alleghany johnston he had an odd habit of falling into a state of incessant * as soon as he became the least startled or agitated in such times he seemed persistently to be * one eye at you he meant nothing by it and in point of fact did not know himself that he was doing it in mexico he had been wounded in the eye and the nerve * independently of his will during the winter of 1862 and 1863 he was on crutches after a while he hobbled down franklin street with us we proud to accommodate our pace to that of the wounded general his ankle continued stiff so when he sat down another chair had to be put before him on this he stretched out his stiff leg straight as a * at that time he was our only wounded knight and the girls waited on him and made life pleasant for him one night i listened to two * at once in a distracted state of mind between the two william porcher miles in a perfectly modulated voice in * accents and low tones was * the happy end of his affair he had been engaged to sweet little bettie bierne and i gave him my congratulations with all my heart it was a capital match suitable in every way good for her and good for him i was deeply interested in mr miless story but there was din and discord on the other hand old edward our pet general sat diagonally across the room with one leg straight out like a * wrapped in red carpet * as red as a * in the face his head is strangely shaped like a * or an oldfashioned * or as buck said there are three tiers of it it is like a popes tiara there he sat with a loud voice and a thousand * making love to mary p i make no excuse for listening it was impossible not to hear him i tried not to lose a word of mr miless * as the despair of the veteran was thundered into my other ear i lent an ear to each * mary can not altogether control her voice and her shrill screams of * no no never etc utterly failed to suppress her wounded lovers * * of his undying affection for her buck said afterward we heard every word of it on our side of the room even when mamie shrieked to him that he was talking too loud now mamie said we afterward do you think it was kind to tell him he was forty if he was a day strange to say the pet general edward * his love in a day at least two days after he was heard to say that he was paying attentions now to his cousin john prestons second daughter her name sally but they called her * buchanan campbell preston a lovely girl and with her he now drove rode and hobbled on his crutches sent her his photograph and in due time * her from the same spot where he had courted mary with * to marry him buck was never so decided in her * as mary not so loud at * in amendment says buck who always reads what i have written and makes comments of assent or dissent so again he began to thunder in a womans ears his tender passion as they rode down franklin street buck says she knows the people on the sidewalk heard * of the conversation though she rode as rapidly as she could and she begged him not to talk so loud finally they dashed up to our door as if they had been running a race unfortunate in love but fortunate in war our general is now winning new laurels with ewell in the valley or with the army of the potomac i think i have told how miles still so gently oer me leaning told of his successful love while general edward johnston roared unto anguish and disappointment over his failures mr miles spoke of sweet little bettie bierne as if she had been a french girl just from a convent kept far from the haunts of men wholly for him one would think to hear him that bettie had never cast those innocent blue eyes of hers on a man until he came along now since i first knew miss bierne in 1857 when pat calhoun was to the fore she has been followed by a tale of men as long as a * chiefs every summer at the springs their father appeared in the ballroom a little before twelve and chased the three beautiful * home before him in spite of all entreaties and he was said to frown away their too numerous admirers at all hours of the day this new engagement was confided to me as a profound secret of course i did not mention it even to my own household next day little alston morgans adjutant and george deas called as colonel deas removed his gloves he said oh the miles and bierne * you heard of it no what is the row about they are engaged to be married thats all who told you miles himself as we walked down franklin street this afternoon and did he not beg you not to mention it as bettie did not wish it spoken of god bless my soul so he did and i forgot that part entirely colonel alston begged the stout carolinian not to take his * breach of faith too much to heart miss * engagement had caused him a dreadful night a young man who was his intimate friend came to his room in the depths of despair and handed him a letter from miss bierne which was the cause of all his woe not knowing that she was already betrothed to miles he had proposed to her in an eloquent letter in her reply she positively stated that she was engaged to mr miles and instead of thanking her for putting him at once out of his misery he considered the reason she gave as * * the agony of the loveletter and the refusal too late he yelled by * so much for a secret miss bierne and i became fast friends our friendship was based on a mutual admiration for the honorable member from south carolina colonel and mrs myers and colonel and mrs chesnut were the only friends of mr miles who were invited to the wedding at the church door the sexton demanded our credentials no one but those whose names he held in his hand were allowed to enter not twenty people were * mere handful grouped about the altar in that large church we were among the first to arrive then came a faint flutter and mrs * the brides sister swathed in weeds for her young husband who had been killed within a year of her marriage came rapidly up the aisle alone she dropped upon her knees in the front pew and there remained motionless during the whole ceremony a mass of black crape and a dead weight on my heart she has had experience of war a cannonade around richmond interrupted her marriage * sinister * in a year thereafter her bridegroom was stiff and * upon the field of battle while the * turned our thoughts from her and thrilled us with sympathy the bride advanced in white satin and point * mrs myers whispered that it was mrs * weddingdress that the bride had on she remembered the exquisite lace and she shuddered with superstitious forebodings all had been going on delightfully * but a sharp shower cleared the church porch of the curious and as the water splashed we wondered how we were to assemble ourselves at mrs mcfarlands all the horses in richmond had been impressed for some sudden cavalry necessity a few days before i ran between mr mcfarland and senator semmes with my pretty paris rosecolored silk turned over my head to save it and when we arrived at the hospitable mansion of the mcfarlands mr mcfarland took me straight into the drawingroom * forgetting that my ruffled plumes needed a good smoothing and * mrs lee sent for me she was staying at mrs caskies i was taken directly to her room where she was lying on the bed she said before i had taken my seat you know there is a fight going on now at brandy station yes we are anxious john chesnuts company is there too she spoke sadly but quietly my son roony is wounded his brother has gone for him they will soon be here and we shall know all about it unless * wife takes him to her grandfather poor lame mother i am useless to my children mrs caskie said you need not be alarmed the general said in his telegram that it was not a severe wound you know even yankees believe general lee that day mrs lee gave me a likeness of the general in a photograph taken soon after the mexican war she likes it so much better than the later ones he certainly was a handsome man then handsomer even than now i shall prize it for mrs lees sake too she said old mrs chesnut and her aunt nellie custis mrs lewis were very intimate during washingtons administration in philadelphia i told her mrs chesnut senior was the historical member of our family she had so much to tell of revolutionary times she was one of the whiterobed choir of little maidens who scattered flowers before washington at * bridge which everybody who writes a life of washington asks her to give an account of mrs ould and mrs davis came home with me lawrence had a basket of delicious cherries if there were only some ice said i respectfully lawrence answered and also firmly give me money and you shall have ice by the underground telegraph he had heard of an * over the river though its fame was suppressed by certain * as they wanted it all in a wonderfully short time we had * and * altogether it has been a pleasant day and as i sat alone i was laughing lightly now and then at the memory of some funny story suddenly a violent ring and a regular sheaf of telegrams were handed me i could not have drawn away in more consternation if the sheets had been a nest of * first frank hampton was killed at brandy station wade hampton telegraphed mr chesnut to see robert barnwell and make the necessary arrangements to recover the body mr chesnut is still at wilmington i sent for preston johnston and my neighbor colonel patton offered to see that everything proper was done that afternoon i walked out alone willie * had shown me where the body all that was left of frank hampton was to be laid in the capitol mrs * joined me after a while and then mrs singleton preston hampton and peter trezevant with myself and mrs singleton formed the sad procession which followed the coffin there was a company of soldiers drawn up in front of the state house porch mrs singleton said we had better go in and look at him before the coffin was finally closed how i wish i had not looked i remember him so well in all the pride of his magnificent manhood he died of a * across the face and head and was utterly * mrs singleton seemed convulsed with grief in all my life i had never seen such bitter weeping she had her own troubles but i did not know of them we sat for a long time on the great steps of the state house everybody had gone and we were alone we talked of it * we had gone to charleston to see rachel in adrienne lecouvreur and how as i stood waiting in the passage near the drawingroom i had met frank hampton bringing his beautiful bride from the steamer they had just landed afterward at mrs * place in the country we had all spent a delightful week together and now only a few years have passed but nearly all that pleasant company are dead and our world the only world we cared for literally kicked to pieces and she cried we are two lone women stranded here rev robert barnwell was in a desperate condition and mary barnwell her daughter was expecting her confinement every day here now later let me add that it was not until i got back to carolina that i heard of robert * death with scarcely a days interval between it and that of mary and her newborn baby husband wife and child were buried at the same time in the same grave in columbia and now mrs singleton has three orphan grandchildren what a * year it has been to her robert barnwell had insisted upon being sent to the hospital at staunton on account of his wifes situation the doctor also had advised it he was carried off on a mattress his brave wife tried to prevent it and said it is only fever and she nursed him to the last she tried to say goodby cheerfully and called after him as soon as my trouble is over i will come to you at staunton at the hospital they said it was typhoid fever he died the second day after he got there poor mary fainted when she heard the ambulance drive away with him then she crept into a low * kept for the children in her mothers room she never left that bed again when the message came from staunton that fever was the matter with robert and nothing more mrs singleton says she will never forget the expression in marys eyes as she turned and looked at her robert will get well she said it is all right her face was radiant blazing with light that night the baby was born and mrs singleton got a telegram that robert was dead she did not tell mary standing as she did at the window while she read it she was at the same time looking for roberts body which might come any moment as for marys life being in danger she had never thought of such a thing she was thinking only of robert then a servant touched her and said look at mrs barnwell she ran to the bedside and the doctor who had come in said it is all over she is dead not in anger not in wrath came the angel of death that day he came to set mary free from a world grown too hard to bear during stonemans raid i burned some personal papers molly constantly said to me missis listen to de guns burn up everything mrs lyons says they are sure to come and theyll put in their newspapers whatever you write here every day the guns did sound very near and when mrs davis rode up and told me that if mr davis left richmond i must go with her i confess i lost my head so i burned a part of my journal but * it afterward from * implacable enemy that lets me forget none of the things i would i am weak with dates i do not always worry to look at the calendar and write them down besides i have not always a calendar at hand amden s c september 10 #* is a comfort to turn from small political * to our grand * lee and kirby smith after council and convention * lee has proved to be all that my husband prophesied of him when he was so unpopular and when joe johnston was the great god of war the very sound of the word convention or council is wearisome not that i am quite ready for richmond yet we must look after home and plantation affairs which we have sadly neglected heaven help my husband through the deep waters the wedding of miss aiken daughter of governor aiken the largest * in south carolina julia rutledge one of the bridesmaids the place flat rock we could not for a while imagine what julia would do for a dress my sister kate remembered some muslin she had in the house for curtains bought before the war and laid aside as not needed now the stuff was white and thin a little coarse but then we covered it with no end of beautiful lace it made a charming dress and how altogether lovely julia looked in it the night of the wedding it stormed as if the world were coming to an * rain thunder and lightning in an unlimited supply around the mountain cottage the bride had a duchesse dressingtable muslin and lace not one of the * of honest * poverty but a millionaires attempt at appearing economical in the idea that that style was in better taste as placing the family more on the same plane with their less comfortable * a candle was left too near this light drapery and it took fire outside was lightning enough to fire the world inside the bridal chamber was ablaze and there was wind enough to blow the house down the mountainside the english maid behaved heroically and with the aid of mrs aikens and mrs mat * servants put the fire out without disturbing the marriage ceremony then being performed below everything in the bridal chamber was burned up except the bed and that was a mass of * * and flakes of charred and blackened wood at kingsville i caught a glimpse of our army longstreets corps was going west god bless the gallant fellows not one man was intoxicated not one rude word did i hear it was a strange * part of it there were miles apparently of platform cars soldiers rolled in their blankets lying in rows heads all covered fast asleep in their gray blankets packed in regular order they looked like swathed mummies one man near where i sat was writing on his knee he used his cap for a desk and he was seated on a rail i watched him wondering to whom that letter was to * no doubt sore hearts for him there a feeling of awful depression laid hold of me all these fine fellows were going to kill or be killed why and a phrase got to beating about my head like an old song the * brave when a knot of boyish laughing young creatures passed me a queer thrill of sympathy shook me ah i know how your * feel poor children once last winter persons came to us in camden with such strange stories of captain morgans man stories of his father too turf tales and murder or at least how he killed people he had been a tremendous favorite with my husband who brought him in once leading him by the hand afterward he said to me with these girls in the house we must be more cautious i agreed to be coldly polite to after all i said i barely know him when he called afterward in richmond i was very glad to see him utterly forgetting that he was under a ban we had a long confidential talk he told me of his wife and children of his army career and told morgan stories he grew more and more cordial and so did i he thanked me for the kind reception given him in that house told me i was a true friend of his and related to me a scrape he was in which if * would ruin him although he was innocent but time would clear all things he begged me not to repeat anything he had told me of his affairs not even to colonel chesnut which i promised promptly and then he went away i sat * the fire thinking what a curiously interesting creature he was this famous captain when the * slowly opened and colonel chesnut appeared he had come home two hours ago from the war office with a headache and had been lying on the sofa behind that * listening for mortal hours so this is your style of being coldly polite he said fancy my feelings indeed i had forgotten all about what they had said of him the lies they told of him never once crossed my mind he is a great deal * and i dare say just as good as those who malign him mattie * i knew her as a handsome girl in washington several years ago got tired of hearing federals abusing john morgan one day they were worse than ever in their abuse and she grew restive by way of putting a mark against the name of so rude a girl the yankee officer said what is your name write mattie * now but by the grace of god one day i hope to call myself the wife of john morgan she did not know morgan but morgan eventually heard the story a good joke it was said to be but he made it a point to find her out and as she was as pretty as she was patriotic by the grace of god she is now mrs morgan these timid southern women under the guns can be brave enough aunt charlotte has told a story of my dear mother they were up at * ala a white mans country where negroes are not wanted the ladies had with them several negroes belonging to my uncle at whose house they were staying in the owners absence one negro man who had married and dwelt in a cabin was for some cause particularly obnoxious to the neighborhood my aunt and my mother oldfashioned ladies shrinking from everything outside their own door knew nothing of all this they occupied rooms on opposite sides of an open passageway underneath the house was open and unfinished suddenly one night my aunt heard a terrible * as of a man running for his life pursued by men and dogs shouting hallooing barking she had only time to lock herself in utterly cut off from her sister she sat down dumb with terror when there began loud knocking at the door with men swearing dogs tearing round * racing in and out of the passage and barking underneath the house like mad aunt charlotte was sure she heard the panting of a negro as he ran into the house a few minutes before what could have become of him where could he have hidden the men shook the doors and windows loudly threatening vengeance my aunt pitied her feeble sister cut off in the room across the passage this fright might kill her the cursing and shouting continued unabated a mans voice in * accents made itself heard above all leave my house you rascals said the voice if you are not gone in two seconds ill shoot there was a dead silence except for the noise of the dogs quickly the men slipped away once out of * they began to call their dogs after it was all over my aunt crept across the passage sister what man was it scared them away my mother laughed aloud in her triumph i am the man she said but where is john out crept john from a corner of the room where my mother had thrown some rubbish over him lawd bless you miss mary opened de do for me and dey was right behind * me aunt says mother was awfully proud of her prowess and she showed some moral courage too at the presidents in richmond once general lee was there and constance and hetty cary came in also miss sanders and others constance cary was telling some war anecdotes among them one of an attempt to get up a supper the night before at some high and mighty f f * house and of how several * went into the kitchen to prepare something to eat by the light of one forlorn candle one of the men in the party not being of a useful temperament turned up a tub and sat down upon it custis lee wishing also to rest found nothing upon which to sit but a gridiron one remembrance i kept of the evening at the presidents general lee bowing over the beautiful miss carys hands in the passage outside miss rose to have her part in the picture and asked mr davis to walk with her into the adjoining drawingroom he seemed surprised but rose * and with a scowling brow was led off as they passed where mrs davis sat miss with all sail set looked back and said dont be jealous mrs davis i have an important communication to make to the president mrs daviss amusement resulted in a significant now did you ever during stonemans raid on a sunday i was in mrs randolphs pew the battle of chancellorsville was also raging the rattling of ammunition wagons the tramp of soldiers the everlasting slamming of those iron gates of the capitol square just opposite the church made it hard to attend to the service then began a scene calculated to make the stoutest heart * the sexton would walk quietly up the aisle to deliver messages to worshipers whose relatives had been brought in wounded dying or dead * people would then follow him out finally the rev mr minnegerode bent across the * to the sexton for a few minutes whispered with the sexton and then disappeared the assistant clergyman resumed the communion which mr minnegerode had been administering at the church door stood mrs minnegerode as tragically wretched and as * as ever mrs * was she managed to say to her husband your son is at the station dead when these agonized parents reached the station however it proved to be some one elses son who was * a son all the same pale and wan came mr minnegerode back to his place within the altar rails after the sacred communion was over some one asked him what it all meant and he said oh it was not my son who was killed but it came so near it aches me yet at home i found l q washington who stayed to dinner i saw that he and my husband were intently preoccupied by some event which they did not see fit to communicate to me immediately after dinner my husband lent mr washington one of his horses and they rode off together i betook myself to my kind neighbors the * for information there i found colonel patton had gone too mrs patton however knew all about the trouble she said there was a raiding party within forty miles of us and no troops were in richmond they asked me to stay to * kind * in some way we might learn what was going on after tea we went out to the capitol square lawrence and three * going along to protect us they seemed to be * in citizens by the thousands company after company was being formed then battalions and then regiments it was a wonderful sight to us peering through the iron railing watching them fall into ranks then we went to the presidents finding the family at supper we sat on the white marble steps and general elzey told me exactly how things stood and of our immediate danger pickets were coming in men were spurring to and from the door as fast as they could ride bringing and carrying messages and orders calmly general elzey * upon our present weakness and our chances for aid after a while mrs davis came out and embraced me silently it is dreadful i said the enemy is within forty miles of * forty who told you that tale said she they are within three miles of richmond i went down on my knees like a stone you had better be quiet she said the president is ill women and children must not add to the trouble she asked me to stay all night which i was thankful to do we sat up officers were coming and going and we gave them what refreshment we could from a side table kept constantly replenished finally in the excitement the constant state of activity and change of persons we forgot the danger officers told us jolly stories and seemed in fine spirits so we gradually took heart there was not a moments rest for any one mrs davis said something more amusing than ever we look like frightened women and children dont we early next morning the president came down he was still feeble and pale from illness custis lee and my husband loaded their pistols and the president drove off in dr garnetts carriage my husband and custis lee on horseback alongside him by eight oclock the troops from petersburg came in and the danger was over the authorities will never strip richmond of troops again we had a narrow squeeze for it but we escaped it was a terrible night although we made the best of it i was walking on franklin street when i met my husband come with me to the war office for a few minutes said he and then i will go home with you what could i do but go he took me up a dark stairway and then down a long dark corridor and he left me sitting in a window saying he would not be gone a second he was obliged to go into the secretary of wars room there i sat mortal hours men came to light the gas from the first i put down my veil so that nobody might know me numbers of persons passed that i knew but i scarcely felt respectable seated up there in that odd way so i said not a word but looked out of the window judge campbell slowly walked up and down with his hands behind his * saddest face i ever saw he had jumped down in his patriotism from judge of the supreme court u s a to be * of something or * do not know * s a no wonder he was out of spirits that night finally judge ould came him i called and he joined me at once in no little amazement to find me there and stayed with me until james chesnut appeared in point of fact i sent him to look up that stray member of my family when my husband came he said oh mr seddon and i got into an argument and time slipped away the truth is i utterly forgot you were here when we were once more out in the street he began now dont scold me for there is bad news pemberton has been fighting the yankees by brigades and he has been beaten every time and now vicksburg must go i suppose that was his side of the argument with seddon once again i visited the war office i went with mrs ould to see her husband at his office we wanted to arrange a party on the river on the flagoftruce boat and to visit those beautiful places * and brandon my husband got into one of his too careful fits said there was risk in it and so he upset all our plans then i was to go up to john * by the canalboat that too he vetoed too risky as if anybody was going to trouble us james chesnut is at home on his way back to richmond had been sent by the president to make the rounds of the western armies says polk is a splendid old fellow they accuse him of having been asleep in his tent at seven oclock when he was ordered to attack at daylight but he has too good a conscience to sleep so soundly the battle did not begin until eleven at chickamauga when bragg had ordered the advance at daylight bragg and his generals do not agree i think a general worthless whose subalterns quarrel with him something is wrong about the man good generals are adored by their soldiers see napoleon csar stonewall lee old sam hood received his orders to hold a certain bridge against the enemy and he had already driven the enemy several miles beyond it when the slow generals were still asleep hood has won a victory though he has only one leg to stand on mr chesnut was with the president when he reviewed our army under the enemys guns before chattanooga he told mr davis that every honest man he saw out west thought well of joe johnston he knows that the president * joe johnston for all the trouble he has given him and general joe returns the compliment with compound interest his hatred of jeff davis amounts to a religion with him it colors all things joe johnston advancing or retreating i may say with more truth is magnetic he does draw the goodwill of those by whom he is surrounded being such a good * it is a pity he had not elected to hate somebody else than the president of our country he hates not wisely but too well our friend breckinridge received mr chesnut with open arms there is nothing narrow nothing selfseeking about breckinridge he has not mounted a pair of green spectacles made of prejudices so that he sees no good except in his own redhot * young wade hampton has been here for a few days a guest of our nearest neighbor and cousin * stockton wade without being the beauty or the athlete that his brother preston is is such a nice boy we lent him horses and ended by giving him a small party what was lacking in company was made up for by the excellence of old colonel chesnuts ancient madeira and champagne if everything in the confederacy were only as truly good as the old colonels * then we had a salad and a jelly cake general joe johnston is so careful of his aides that wade has never yet seen a battle says he has always happened to be sent afar off when the fighting came he does not seem too grateful for this and means to be transferred to his fathers command he says no man * himself more recklessly to danger than general johnston and no one * harder to keep others out of it but the business of this war is to save the country and a commander must risk his mens lives to do it there is a french saying that you cant make an * unless you are willing to break eggs for a week we have had such a tranquil happy time here both my husband and johnny are here still james chesnut spent his time sauntering around with his father or stretched on the rug before my fire reading vanity fair and * by good luck he had not read them before we have kept * for the last he owns that he is having a good time johnny is happy too he does not care for books he will read a novel now and then if the girls continue to talk of it before him nothing else whatever in the way of literature does he touch he comes pulling his long blond mustache * as if he hoped to be advised not to read * mary shall i like this thing i do not think he has an idea what we are fighting about and he does not want to know he says my company my men with a pride a faith and an affection which are sublime he came into his inheritance at twentyone just as the war began and it was a goodly one fine old houses and an estate to match yesterday johnny went to his plantation for the first time since the war began john witherspoon went with him and reports in this way how do you do marster how you come * from every side rang the * welcome from the darkies johnny was silently shaking black hands right and left as he rode into the crowd as the noise subsided to the overseer he said send down more corn and fodder for my horses and to the driver have you any peas plenty sir send a wagonload down for the cows at bloomsbury while i stay there they have not milk and butter enough there for me any eggs send down all you can collect how about my turkeys and ducks send them down two at a time how about the mutton fat thats good send down two a week as they rode home john witherspoon remarked i was surprised that you did not go into the fields to see your crops what was the use and the negroes you had so little talk with them no use to talk to them before the overseer they are coming down to bloomsbury day and night by * and they talk me dead besides william and parish go up there every night and god knows they tell me enough plantation * * his nest negroes ditto at my expense between the two fires i mean to get something to eat while i am here for him we got up a charming picnic at mulberry everything was * most perfect of days and the old place in great beauty those large rooms were delightful for dancing we had as good a dinner as mortal appetite could crave the best fish fowl and game wine from a cellar that can not be excelled in spite of blockade mulberry does the honors nobly yet mrs edward stockton drove down with me she helped me with her taste and tact in arranging things we had no trouble however all of the old servants who have not been moved to bloomsbury scented the prey from afar and they literally flocked in and made themselves useful ichmond va november 28 #* pleasant home sojourn was soon broken up johnny had to go back to company a and my husband was ordered by the president to make a second visit to braggs army so we came on here where the prestons had taken apartments for me molly was with me adam team the overseer with isaac * help came with us to take charge of the eight huge boxes of provisions i brought from home isaac mollys husband is a servant of ours the only one my husband ever bought in his life * wife belonged to rev thomas davis and isaac to somebody else the owner of isaac was about to go west and isaac was distracted they asked one thousand dollars for him he is a huge creature really a magnificent specimen of a colored gentleman his occupation had been that of a * now he is a carpenter or will be some day he is awfully grateful to us for buying him is really devoted to his wife and children though he has a strange way of showing it for he has a mistress en * as the french say which fact molly never failed to grumble about as soon as his back was turned great big goodfornothing thing come * to marster to buy him for his wifes sake and all the time he an oh molly stop that said i mr davis visited charleston and had an enthusiastic reception he described it all to general preston governor aikens perfect old carolina style of living delighted him those old grayhaired darkies and their noiseless * service the result of finished * does miss that sort of thing when away from home where your own servants think for you they know your ways and your wants they save you all responsibility even in matters of your own ease and well doing the butler at mulberry would be miserable and feel himself a ridiculous failure were i ever forced to ask him for anything i must describe an adventure i had in kingsville of course i know nothing of children in point of fact am awfully afraid of them mrs edward barnwell came with us from camden she had a magnificent boy two years old now dont expect me to reduce that * for this little creature is a wonder of childlike beauty health and strength why not if like produces like and with such a handsome pair to claim as father and mother the boys eyes alone would make any girls fortune at first he made himself very agreeable repeating nursery rhymes and singing then something went wrong suddenly he changed to a little fiend fought and kicked and scratched like a tiger he did everything that was naughty and he did it with a will as if he liked it while his lovely mamma with flushed cheeks and streaming eyes was imploring him to be a good boy when we stopped at kingsville i got out first then mrs * nurse who put the little man down by me look after him a moment please maam she said i must help mrs barnwell with the bundles etc she stepped hastily back and the cars moved off they ran down a half mile to turn i trembled in my shoes this child no man could ever frighten me so if he should choose to be bad again it seemed an eternity while i waited for that train to turn and come back again my little charge took things quietly for me he had a perfect contempt no fear whatever and i was his abject slave for the * he stretched himself out lazily at full length then he pointed downward those are great legs said he solemnly looking at his own i immediately joined him in admiring them enthusiastically near him he * a bundle * cat tied up in that bundle he was up in a second and * upon it if we were to be taken up as thieves no matter i dared not meddle with that child i had seen what he could do there were several cooked sweet potatoes tied up in an old * to some negro probably he * himself off comfortably broke one in half and began to eat evidently he had found what he was fond of in this posture mrs barnwell discovered us she came with comic dismay in every feature not knowing what our relations might be and whether or not we had undertaken to fight it out alone as best we might the old nurse cried * me with both hands uplifted without a word i fled in another moment the wilmington train would have left me she was going to columbia we broke down only once between kingsville and wilmington but between wilmington and weldon we contrived to do the thing so effectually as to have to remain twelve hours at that forlorn station the one room that i saw was crowded with soldiers adam team succeeded in securing two chairs for me upon one of which i sat and put my feet on the other molly sat flat on the floor resting her head against my chair i woke cold and cramped an officer who did not give his name but said he was from louisiana came up and urged me to go near the fire he gave me his seat by the fire where i found an old lady and two young ones with two men in the uniform of common soldiers we talked as easily to each other all night as if we had known one another all our lives we discussed the war the army the news of the day no questions were asked no names given no personal discourse whatever and yet if these men and women were not gentry and of the best sort i do not know ladies and gentlemen when i see them being a little surprised at the want of interest mr team and isaac showed in my welldoing i walked out to see and i found them working like * they had been at it all night in the * my boxes were smashed they had first gathered up the contents and were trying to hammer up the boxes so as to make them once more available at petersburg a * dressed woman came in looked around in the crowd then asked for the seat by me now mollys seat was paid for the same as mine but she got up at once gave the lady her seat and stood behind me i am sure molly believes herself my bodyguard as well as my servant the lady then having arranged herself comfortably in mollys seat began in plaintive accents to tell her melancholy tale she was a widow she lost her husband in the battles around richmond soon some one went out and a man offered her the vacant seat straight as an arrow she went in for a flirtation with the polite gentleman another person a perfect stranger said to me well look yonder as soon as she began whining about her dead beau i knew she was after another one beau indeed cried another listener she said it was her husband husband or lover all the same she wont lose any time it wont be her fault if she doesnt have another one soon but the grand scene was the night before the cars crowded with soldiers of course not a human being that i knew an irish woman so announced by her brogue came in she marched up and down the car loudly lamenting the want of gallantry in the men who would not make way for her two men got up and gave her their seats saying it did not matter they were going to get out at the next stoppingplace she was gifted with the most pronounced brogue i ever heard and she gave us a taste of it she continued to say that the men ought all to get out of that that car was * only for ladies she placed on the vacant seat next to her a large * she continued to harangue until she fell asleep a tired soldier coming in seeing what he supposed to be an empty seat quietly slipped into it crash went the glass the soldier groaned the irish woman shrieked the man was badly cut by the broken glass she was simply a mad woman she shook her fist in his face said she was a lone woman and he had got into that seat for no good purpose how did he dare * i do not think the man uttered a word the conductor took him into another car to have the pieces of glass picked out of his clothes and she continued to rave mr team shouted aloud and laughed as if he were in the hermitage swamp the womans unreasonable wrath and absurd accusations were comic no doubt soon the car was silent and i fell into a comfortable doze i felt molly give me a gentle shake listen missis how loud mars adam team is talking and all about ole marster and our business and to strangers its a shame is he saying any harm of us no maam not that he is bragging for dear life bout how ole ole marster is and how rich he is an all that i gwine tell him stop up started molly mars adam missis say please dont talk so loud when people travel they dont do that a way mr prestons man hal was waiting at the depot with a carriage to take me to my richmond house mary preston had rented these apartments for me i found my dear girls there with a nice fire everything looked so pleasant and inviting to the weary traveler mrs grundy who occupies the lower floor sent me such a real virginia tea hot cakes and rolls think of living in the house with mrs grundy and having no fear of what mrs grundy will say my husband has come he likes the house * and everything already he has bought * horses for sixteen hundred confederate dollars cash he is nearer to being contented and happy than i ever saw him he has not established a grievance yet but i am on the lookout daily he will soon find out whatever there is wrong about cary street i gave a party mrs davis very witty preston girls very handsome * fun fast and furious no party could have gone off more successfully but my husband * we are to have no more festivities this is not the time or the place for such * maria * is perfectly delightful on the subject of her wedding she is ready to the last piece of lace but her hardhearted father says no she adores john lewis that goes without saying she does not pretend however to be as much in love as mary preston in point of fact she never saw any one before who was but she is as much in love as she can be with a man who though he is not very handsome is as eligible a match as a girl could make he is all that heart could wish and he comes of such a handsome family his mother * maria * was the beauty of a century and his father was a nephew of general washington for all that he is far better looking than john darby or mr miles she always intended to marry better than mary preston or bettie bierne lucy haxall is positively engaged to captain * an englishman she is convinced that she will marry him he is her first fancy mr venable of lees staff was at our party so out of spirits he knows everything that is going on his depression * us no good today general hampton sent james chesnut a fine saddle that he had captured from the yankees in battle array mrs scotch allan edgar allan poes patrons wife sent me icecream and * apples from her farm john r thompson the sole literary fellow i know in richmond sent me leisure hours in town by a country parson my husband says he hopes i will be contented because he came here this winter to please me if i could have been satisfied at home he would have resigned his * and gone into some service in south carolina i am a good excuse if good for nothing else old tempestuous keitt breakfasted with us yesterday i wish i could remember half the brilliant things he said my husband has now gone with him to the war office colonel keitt thinks it is time he was promoted he wants to be a brigadier now charleston is bombarded night and day it fairly makes me dizzy to think of that everlasting * they are beating about peoples ears down there bragg defeated and separated from longstreet it is a long street that knows no turning and rosecrans is not taken after all anxiety pervades lee is fighting meade misery is everywhere bragg is falling back before grant longstreet the soldiers call him peter the slow is settling down before knoxville general lee requires us to answer every letter said mr venable and to do our best to console the poor creatures whose husbands and sons are fighting the battles of the country bragg begs to be relieved of his command the army will be relieved to get rid of him he has a winning way of earning everybodys detestation heavens how they hate him the rapid flight of his army terminated at ringgold hardie declines even a temporary command of the western army preston johnston has been sent out posthaste at a moments warning he was not even allowed time to go home and tell his wife goodby or as browne the englishman said to put a clean shirt into his traveling bag lee and meade are facing each other gallantly the first of december we went with a party of mrs oulds getting up to see a french frigate which lay at anchor down the river the french officers came on board our boat the lees were aboard the french officers were not in the least attractive either in manners or appearance but our ladies were most attentive and some showered bad french upon them with a lavish hand always accompanied by queer * to * out the scanty supply of french words the sentences ending usually in a nervous shriek are they deaf asked mrs randolph the french frigate was a dirty little thing doctor garnett was so * up with hope that the french were coming to our rescue that he would not let me say an english manofwar is the * thing known in the world captain said to mary lee with a foreign * of countenance that went for a smile is * judge ould said as we went to dinner on our own steamer they will not drink our presidents health they do not acknowledge us to be a nation mind none of you say emperor not once doctor garnett interpreted the laws of politeness otherwise and stepped forward his mouth fairly distended with so much french and said * * young gibson seconded him quietly la * de * but silence prevailed preston hampton was the handsomest man on * figure of hercules the face of apollo cried an enthusiastic girl preston was as lazy and as sleepy as ever he said of the frenchmen they cant help not being goodlooking but with all the world open to them to wear such shabby clothes the lieutenants name was * on the french frigate lying on one of the tables was a volume of jean jacques * works side by side strange to say with a map of south carolina this lieutenant was courteously asked by mary lee to select some lady to whom she might introduce him he answered i * you with a bow that was a benediction and a prayer and now i am in a fine condition for hetty carys starvation party where they will give thirty dollars for the music and not a cent for a morsel to eat preston said contentedly i hate dancing and i hate cold water so i will * the * tonight found john r thompson at our house when i got home so tired tonight he brought me the last number of the * he knew how much i was interested in * story * parsonage my husband bought yesterday at the commissarys one barrel of flour one bushel of potatoes one peck of rice five pounds of salt beef and one peck of * for sixty dollars in the street a barrel of flour sells for one hundred and fifteen dollars wigfall was here last night he began by wanting to hang jeff davis my husband managed him beautifully he soon ceased to talk virulent nonsense and calmed down to his usual strong common sense i knew it was quite late but i had no idea of the hour my husband beckoned me out it is all your fault said he what why will you persist in looking so interested in all wigfall is saying dont let him catch your eye look into the fire did you not hear it strike two this attack was so sudden so violent so * for i could only laugh hysterically however as an obedient wife i went back gravely took my seat and looked into the fire i did not even dare raise my eyes to see what my husband was * he too looked into the fire wigfall soon tired of so tame an audience and took his departure general lawton was here he was one of stonewalls generals so i listened with all my ears when he said stonewall could not sleep so every two or three nights you were waked up by orders to have your brigade in marching order before daylight and report in person to the commander then you were marched a few miles out and then a few miles in again all this was to make us ready ever on the alert and the end of it was this jacksons men would go half a days march before peter longstreet waked and breakfasted i think there is a popular delusion about the amount of praying he did he certainly preferred a fight on sunday to a sermon failing to manage a fight he loved best a long presbyterian sermon * to the core he had shown small sympathy with human infirmity he was a * man he looked upon brokendown men and stragglers as the same thing he classed all who were weak and weary who fainted by the wayside as men wanting in patriotism if a mans face was as white as cotton and his pulse so low you scarce could feel it he looked upon him merely as an inefficient soldier and rode off impatiently he was the true type of all great soldiers like the successful warriors of the world he did not value human life where he had an object to accomplish he could order men to their death as a matter of course his soldiers obeyed him to the death faith they had in him stronger than death their respect he commanded i doubt if he had so much of their love as is talked about while he was alive now that they see a few more years of stonewall would have freed them from the yankees they * him any man is proud to have been one of the famous stonewall brigade but be sure it was bitter hard work to keep up with him as all know who ever served under him he gave his orders rapidly and distinctly and rode away never allowing answer or remonstrance it was look * that * it when you failed you were apt to be put under arrest when you reported the place taken he only said good spent seventyfive dollars today for a little tea and sugar and have five hundred left my husbands pay never has paid for the rent of our lodgings he came in with dreadful news just now i have wept so often for things that never happened i will withhold my tears now for a certainty today a poor woman threw herself on her dead husbands coffin and kissed it she was weeping bitterly so did i in sympathy my husband as i told him today could see me and everything that he loved hanged drawn and quartered without moving a muscle if a crowd were looking on he could have the same gentle operation performed on himself and make no sign to all of which violent * he answered in unmoved tones so would any civilized man savages * at * more dignified in that particular than we are noisy * grief never moves me at all it annoys me selfcontrol is what we all need you are a miracle of * selfcontrol is what you need so you are civilized i said some day i mean to be come here mrs chesnut said mary preston today they are lifting general hood out of his carriage here at your door mrs grundy promptly had him borne into her drawingroom which was on the first floor mary preston and i ran down and greeted him as cheerfully and as cordially as if nothing had happened since we saw him standing before us a year ago how he was waited upon some * oranges were brought him how kind people are said he not once since i was wounded have i ever been left without fruit hard as it is to get now the money value of friendship is easily counted now said some one oranges are five dollars apiece mrs davis and mrs lyons came we had luncheon brought in for them and then a lucid explanation of the * * of which * j is the heroine we walked home with mrs davis and met the president riding alone surely that is wrong it must be unsafe for him when there are so many traitors not to speak of bribed negroes burton harrison says mr davis prefers to go alone and there is none to * him my husband laid the law down last night i felt it to be the last drop in my full cup no more * in this house said he this is no time for * and merrymaking and you said you brought me here to enjoy the winter before you took me home and turned my face to a dead wall he is the master of the house to hear is to obey drove out with mrs davis she had a watch in her hand which some poor dead soldier wanted to have sent to his family first we went to her * then we drove to the fair grounds where the band was playing suddenly she missed the watch she remembered having it when we came out of the * we drove back instantly and there the watch was lying near the steps of the little porch in front of the house no one had passed in apparently in any case no one had seen it preston hampton went with me to see conny cary the talk was frantically literary which preston thought hard on him i had just brought the st denis number of les misrables sunday christopher hampton walked to church with me coming out general lee was seen slowly making his way down the aisle bowing royally to right and left i pointed him out to christopher hampton when general lee happened to look our way he bowed low giving me a charming smile of recognition i was ashamed of being so pleased i blushed like a schoolgirl we went to the white house they gave us tea the president said he had been on the way to our house coming with all the davis family to see me but the children became so troublesome they turned back just then little joe rushed in and insisted on saying his prayers at his fathers knee then and there he was in his * a box has come from home for me taking advantage of this good fortune and a full larder have asked mrs davis to dine with me wade hampton sent me a basket of game we had mrs davis and mr and mrs preston after dinner we walked to the church to see the * wedding mr preston had mrs davis on his arm my husband and mrs preston and burton harrison and myself brought up the rear willie allan joined us and we had the pleasure of waiting one good hour then the beautiful maria loveliest of brides sailed in on her fathers arm and major john * lewis followed with mrs * after the ceremony such a kissing was there up and down the aisle the happy bridegroom kissed wildly and several girls complained but he said how am i to know marias kin whom i was to kiss it is better to show too much affection for ones new relations than too little joe johnston has been made commanderinchief of the army of the west general lee had this * said miss agnes lee and little robert as they fondly call general lees youngest son in this * community called they told us the president general lee and general elzey had gone out to look at the fortifications around richmond my husband came home saying he had been with them and lent general lee his gray horse mrs howell mrs daviss mother says a year ago on the cars a man said we want a dictator she replied jeff davis will never consent to be a dictator the man turned sharply toward her and pray who asks him joe johnston will be made dictator by the army of the west * was suggested of late the army of the west has not been in a condition to dictate to friend or foe certainly jeff davis did hate to put joe johnston at the head of what is left of it detached from general lee what a horrible failure is longstreet oh for a day of albert sidney johnston out west and stonewall could he come back to us here general hood the wounded knight came for me to drive i felt that i would soon find myself * some girls but i asked no questions he improved the time between franklin and cary streets by saying i do like your husband so much so do i i replied simply buck was ill in bed so william said at the door but she recovered her health and came down for the drive in black velvet and * looking queenly and then with the top of the landau thrown back wrapped in furs and * we had a long drive that bitter cold day one day as we were * us home from the fair grounds sam the wounded knight asked brewster what are the symptoms of a mans being in love sam hood is called sam entirely but why i do not know said for his part he did not know at seventeen he had fancied himself in love but that was a long time ago brewster spoke on the symptoms of love when you see her your breath is apt to come short if it amounts to mild * you have got it bad you are * jealous * with jealousy and have a gloomy fixed conviction that she likes every fool you meet better than she does you especially people that you know she has a thorough contempt for that is you knew it before you lost your head i mean before you fell in love the last stages of unmitigated * i will spare you said brewster with a giggle and a wave of the hand well said sam drawing a breath of relief i have felt none of these things so far and yet they say i am engaged to four young ladies a liberal allowance you will admit for a man who can not walk without help another day the sabbath we called on our way from church to see mrs wigfall she was ill but mr wigfall insisted upon taking me into the drawingroom to rest a while he said * was there so she was and so was sam hood the wounded knight stretched at full length on a sofa and a rug thrown over him louis wigfall said to me do you know general hood yes said i and the general laughed with his eyes as i looked at him but he did not say a word i felt it a curious commentary upon the reports he had spoken of the day before * wigfall is a very handsome girl as we walked brewster reported a row he had had with general hood brewster had told those six young ladies at the prestons that old sam was in the habit of saying he would not marry if he could any silly sentimental girl who would throw herself away upon a maimed creature such as he was when brewster went home he took pleasure in telling sam how the ladies had complimented his good sense whereupon the general rose in his wrath and threatened to break his crutch over * head to think he could be such a * go about repeating to everybody his * i was taking my seat at the head of the table when the door opened and brewster walked in unannounced he took his stand in front of the open door with his hands in his pockets and his small hat pushed back as far as it could get from his forehead what said he you are not ready yet the generals are below did you get my note i begged my husband to excuse me and rushed off to put on my bonnet and furs i met the girls coming up with a strange man the flurry of two majorgenerals had been too much for me and i forgot to ask the new ones name they went up to dine in my place with my husband who sat eating his dinner with * undivided attention given to him amid this whirling and * in and out of the world * mary preston and i then went to drive with the generals the new one proved to be buckner who is also a kentuckian the two men told us they had slept together the night before chickamauga it is useless to try legs cant any longer be kept out of the conversation so general buckner said once before i slept with a man and he lost his leg next day he had made a vow never to do so again when sam and i parted that morning we said you or i may be killed but the cause will be safe all the same after the drive everybody came in to tea my husband in famous good humor we had an unusually gay evening it was very nice of my husband to take no notice of my conduct at dinner which had been open to criticism all the comfort of my life depends upon his being in good humor yesterday dined with the prestons wore one of my handsomest paris dresses from paris before the war three magnificent kentucky generals were present with senator orr from south carolina and mr miles general buckner repeated a speech of hoods to him to show how friendly they were i prefer a ride with you to the company of any woman in the world buckner had answered i prefer your company to that of any man certainly was hoods reply this became the standing joke of the dinner it flashed up in every form poor sam got out of it so badly if he got out of it at all general buckner said * lame excuses all hood never gets out of any * is unless he can fight out others dropped in after dinner some without arms some without legs von borcke who can not speak because of a wound in his throat isabella said we have all kinds now but a blind one poor fellows they laugh at wounds and they yet can show many a scar we had for dinner oyster soup besides roast mutton ham boned turkey wild duck partridge plum pudding * * sherry and madeira there is life in the old land yet at my house today after dinner and while alex haskell and my husband sat over the wine hood gave me an account of his discomfiture last night he said he could not sleep after it it was the hardest battle he had ever fought in his life and i was routed as it were she told me there was no hope that ends it you know at petersburg on my way to the western army she * me to think of it she would not say yes but she did not say * is not exactly at any rate i went off saying i am engaged to you and she said i am not engaged to you after i was so fearfully wounded i gave it up but then since i came etc do you mean to say said i that you had proposed to her before that conversation in the carriage when you asked brewster the symptoms of love i like your audacity oh she understood but it is all up now for she says no my husband says i am extravagant no my friend not that said i i had fifteen hundred dollars and i have spent every cent of it in my housekeeping not one cent for myself not one cent for dress nor any personal want whatever he calls me hospitality run mad general hoods an awful * mean an awkward * i told him to praise my husband to some one else not to me he ought to praise me to somebody who would tell my husband and then praise my husband to another person who would tell me man and wife are too much one * wave a compliment straight in the face of one about the other is not graceful one more year of stonewall would have saved us chickamauga is the only battle we have gained since stonewall died and no results follow as usual stonewall was not so much as killed by a yankee he was shot by his own men that is hard general lee can do no more than keep back meade one of meades armies you mean said i for they have only to double on him when lee whips one of them general edward johnston says he got grant a * de corps you know he could not bear to see an old army man driving a wagon that was when he found him out west put out of the army for habitual drunkenness he is their right man a * suwarrow he dont care a snap if men fall like the leaves fall he fights to win that chap does he is not distracted by a thousand side issues he does not see them he is narrow and * only in a straight line like louis napoleon from a battle in the gutter he goes straight up yes as with lincoln they have ceased to * at him as a rough * no gentleman etc you never hear now of lincolns nasty fun only of his wisdom doesnt take much soap and water to wash the hands that the rod of empire sway they talked of lincolns drunkenness too now since vicksburg they have not a word to say against grants habits he has the disagreeable habit of not retreating before irresistible veterans general lee and albert sidney johnston show blood and breeding they are of the bayard and philip sidney order of soldiers listen if general lee had had grants resources he would have * the last yankee or have had them all safe back in massachusetts you mean if he had not the weight of the negro question upon him no i mean if he had grants unlimited allowance of the powers of * money ammunition arms mrs ould says mrs lincoln found the gardener of the white house so nice she would make him a majorgeneral lincoln remarked to the secretary well the little woman must have her way sometimes a word of the last night of the old year * * sent me a cup of strong good coffee i drank two cups and so i did not sleep a wink like a fool i passed my whole life in review and bitter memories maddened me quite then came a happy thought i mapped out a story of the war the plot came to hand for it was true johnny is the hero a light dragoon and heavy swell i will call it f fs for it is the f fs both of south carolina and virginia it is to be a war story and the filling out of the skeleton was the best way to put myself to sleep mrs ives wants us to translate a french play a genuine french captain came in from his ship on the james river and gave us good advice as to how to make the selection general hampton sent another basket of partridges and all goes merry as a marriage bell my husband came in and nearly killed us he brought this piece of news north carolina wants to offer terms of peace we needed only a break of that kind to finish us i really shivered nervously as one does when the first handful of earth comes rattling down on the coffin in the grave of one we cared for more than all who are left at mrs prestons met the light brigade in battle array ready to sally forth conquering and to conquer they would stand no nonsense from me about staying at home to translate a french play indeed the plays that have been sent us are so indecent i scarcely know where a play is to be found that would do at all while at dinner the presidents carriage drove up with only general hood he sent up to ask in maggie howells name would i go with them i tied up two partridges between plates with a * for buck who is ill and then went down we picked up mary preston it was * drive as the soldiers say i was only on escort duty at the prestons major venable met us at the door and took in the partridges to buck as we drove off maggie said major venable is a carolinian i see no virginian to the core but then he was a professor in the south carolina college before the war mary preston said she is taking a fling at your weakness for all south carolina came home and found my husband in a bitter mood it has all gone wrong with our world the loss of our private fortune the smallest part he intimates with so much human misery filling the air we might stay at home and think and go mad said i catch me at it a yawning grave with piles of red earth thrown on one side that is the only future i ever see you remember emma stockton she and i were as * as birds that day at mulberry i came here the next day and when i arrived a telegram said emma stockton found dead in her bed it is awfully near that thought no no i will not stop and think of death always snow of the deepest nobody can come today i thought but they did my girls first then constance cary tripped * clever conny hetty is the beauty so called though she is clever enough too but constance is actually clever and has a * perfect outline next came the four kentuckians and preston hampton he is as tall as the kentuckians and ever so much better looking then we had eggnog i was to take miss cary to the semmess my husband inquired the price of a carriage it was twentyfive dollars an hour he cursed by all his gods at such extravagance the play was not worth the candle or carriage in this instance in confederate money it sounds so much worse than it is i did not dream of asking him to go with me after that lively overture i did intend to go with you he said but you do not ask me and i have been asking you for twenty years to go with me in vain think of that i said tragically we could not wait for him to dress so i sent the * carriage back for him we were behind time as it was when he came the beautiful hetty cary and her friend captain tucker were with him major von borcke and preston hampton were at the carys in the drawingroom when we called for constance who was dressing i challenge the world to produce finer specimens of humanity than these three the prussian von borcke preston hampton and hetty cary we spoke to the prussian about the vote of thanks passed by congress * of the country to major von borcke the poor man was as modest as a * spite of his huge proportions that is a compliment indeed said hetty yes i saw it and the happiest the proudest day of my life as i read it it was at the hotel breakfasttable i try to hide my face with the newspaper i feel it grow so red but my friend he has his newspaper too and he sees the same thing so he looks my * says pointing to * does he grow so red he has got something there and he laughs then i try to read aloud the so kind compliments of the * can not he puts his hand to his throat his broken english and the difficulty of his enunciation with that wound in his * makes it all very * very hard to understand the semmes * party was a perfect success the play was charming sweet little mrs lawson clay had a seat for me banked up among women the female part of the congregation strictly * from the male were placed all together in rows they formed a gay parterre edged by the men in their black coats and gray uniforms toward the back part of the room the mass of black and gray was solid captain tucker * his fate he was stranded out there with those forlorn men but could see us laughing and fancied what we were saying was worth a thousand charades he preferred talking to a clever woman to any known way of passing a pleasant hour so do i somebody said on a sofa of state in front of all sat the president and mrs davis little maggie davis was one of the child * her parents had a right to be proud of her with her flashing black eyes she was a marked figure on the stage she is a handsome creature and she acted her part admirably the shrine was beautiful beyond words the semmes and ives families are roman catholics and understand getting up that sort of thing first came the palmers gray then mrs ives a solitary figure the loveliest of penitent women the eastern pilgrims were delightfully * we could not understand how so much christian piety could come clothed in such * robes mrs ould as a queen was as handsome and regal as heart could wish for she was accompanied by a very satisfactory king whose name if i ever knew i have forgotten there was a resplendent knight of st john and then an american indian after their * they all knelt and laid something on the altar as a * gift burton harrison the presidents handsome young secretary was gotten up as a big brave in a dress presented to mr davis by indians for some kindness he showed them years ago it was a complete warriors outfit scant as that is the feathers stuck in the back of mr harrisons head had a charmingly comic effect he had to * himself as clean as a baby or he could not act the beardless chief spotted tail billy * big thunder or whatever his character was so he folded up his loved and lost mustache the * red indian and laid it on the altar the most sacred treasure of his life the witness of his most heroic sacrifice on the shrine senator hill of georgia took me in to supper where were * chicken salad oysters and champagne the president came in alone i suppose for while we were talking after supper and your humble servant was standing between mrs randolph and mrs stanard he approached offered me his arm and we walked off oblivious of mr senator hill remember this ladies and forgive me for recording it but mrs stanard and mrs randolph are the handsomest women in richmond i am no older than they are or younger either sad to say now the president walked with me slowly up and down that long room and our conversation was of the saddest nobody knows so well as he the difficulties which beset this * confederacy he has a voice which is perfectly modulated a comfort in this loud and rough soldier world i think there is a melancholy cadence in his voice at times of which he is unconscious when he talks of things as they are now my husband was so intensely charmed with hetty cary that he declined at the first call to accompany his wife home in the * carriage he ordered it to return when it came his wife a good manager packed the carys and him in with herself leaving the other two men who came with the party when it was divided into trips to make their way home in the cold at our door near daylight of that bitter cold morning i had the pleasure to see my husband like a man stand and pay for that carriage today he is pleased with himself with me and with all the world says if there was no such word as fascinating you would have to * one to describe hetty cary met mrs wigfall she wants me to take halsey to mrs randolphs theatricals i am to get him up as sir walter raleigh now general breckinridge has come i like him better than any of them morgan also is here these huge kentuckians fill the town isabella says they hold morgan accountable for the loss of chattanooga the follies of the wise the weaknesses of the great she shakes her head significantly when i begin to tell why i like him so well last night general buckner came for her to go with him and * at the carys for mrs randolphs charades the presidents man jim that he believed in as we all believe in our own servants our own people as we call them and betsy mrs daviss maid * last night it is miraculous that they had the fortitude to resist the temptation so long at mrs daviss the hired servants all have been birds of passage first they were seen with gold * and then they would fly to the yankees and i am sure they had nothing to tell it is yankee money wasted i do not think it had ever crossed mrs daviss brain that these two could leave her she knew however that betsy had eighty dollars in gold and two thousand four hundred dollars in confederate notes everybody who comes in brings a little bad * much in itself but by * process the effect is depressing indeed tonight there will be a great gathering of kentuckians morgan gives them a dinner the city of richmond * john morgan he is at free quarters the girls dined here conny cary came back for more white feathers isabella had appropriated two sets and obstinately refused constance cary a single feather from her pile she said sternly i have never been on the stage before and i have a presentiment when my father hears of this i will never go again i am to appear before the footlights as an english * duchess and i mean to rustle in every feather to wear all the lace and diamonds these two houses can * and mrs prestons she was jolly but firm and constance departed without any additional plumage for her lady * gave mrs white twentythree dollars for a turkey came home wondering all the way why she did not ask twentyfive two more dollars could not have made me * at the bargain and twentythree sounds odd what a day the kentuckians have had mrs webb gave them a breakfast from there they proceeded en masse to general lawtons dinner and then came straight here all of which seems equal to one of stonewalls forced marches general lawton took me in to supper in spite of his dinner he had misgivings my heart is heavy said he even here all seems too light too careless for such terrible times it seems out of place here in battlescarred richmond i have heard something of that kind at home i replied hope and fear are both gone and it is distraction or death with us i do not see how sadness and despondency would help us if it would do any good we would be sad enough we laughed at general hood general lawton thought him better fitted for gallantry on the battlefield than playing a lute in my ladys chamber when miss giles was * the audience as the fair penitent some one said oh that is so pretty hood cried out with stern * that is not pretty it is elegant not only had my house been rifled for theatrical * but as the play went on they came for my black velvet cloak when it was over i thought i should never get away my cloak was so hard to find but it gave me an opportunity to witness many things behind the * cloak hunt did behind the scenes i know a little what that means now general jeb stuart was at mrs randolphs in his cavalry jacket and high boots he was devoted to hetty cary constance cary said to me pointing to his stars hetty likes them that way you * and with stars a visit from the presidents handsome and accomplished secretary burton harrison i lent him country clergyman in town and elective affinities he is to bring me mrs * lost and saved at mrs randolphs my husband complimented one of the ladies who had amply earned his praise by her splendid acting she pointed to a young man saying you see that wretch he has not said one word to me my husband asked innocently why should he and why is he a wretch oh you know going home i explained this riddle to him he is always a year * in gossip they said those two were engaged last winter and now there seems to be a * loose but that sort of thing always comes right the carys prefer james chesnut to his wife i dont mind indeed i like it i do too every sunday mr minnegerode cried aloud in anguish his litany from pestilence and famine battle murder and sudden death and we wailed on our knees good lord deliver us and on monday and all the week long we go on as before hearing of nothing but battle murder and sudden death which are daily events now i have a new book that is the unlookedfor thing a pleasing incident in this life of monotonous misery we live in a huge * we are shut in guarded from light without at breakfast today came a card and without an instants interlude perhaps the neatest most fastidious man in south carolina walked in i was * unkempt tattered and torn in my most comfortable worst worn wadded green silk dressinggown with a white woolen shawl over my head to keep off draughts he has not been in the war yet and now he wants to be captain of an engineer corps i wish he may get it he has always been my friend so he shall lack no aid that i can give if he can stand the shock of my appearance today we may reasonably expect to continue friends until death of all men the fastidious barny * to come in he faced the situation gallantly invited to dr * last night to meet the lawtons mr benjamin dropped in he is a friend of the house mrs haxall is a richmond leader of society a cidevant beauty and belle a charming person still and her hospitality is of the genuine virginia type everything mr benjamin said we listened to bore in mind and gave heed to it diligently he is a * oracle of the * shrine and is supposed to enjoy the honor of mr daviss unreserved confidence lamar was asked to dinner here yesterday so he came today we had our wild turkey cooked for him yesterday and i dressed myself within an inch of my life with the best of my * finery two of us my husband and i did not damage the wild turkey seriously so lamar enjoyed the * and commended the art with which molly had hid the slight loss we had inflicted upon its mighty breast she had piled fried oysters over the turkey so skilfully that unless we had told about it no one would ever have known that the huge bird was making his second appearance on the board lamar was more * and * than ever my husband behaved like a * wellbred man with all his wits about him so things went off smoothly enough lamar had just read * across the water he said it was the rage i am sure it is not as good as adam bede or silas * it is not worthy of the woman who was to rival all but shakespeares name below what is the matter with * he asked * is so mean and he is mean in such a very mean way and the end is so repulsive * the husbands * children and * wives may be magnanimity but human nature * at it womans nature you mean yes and now another test two weeks ago i read this thing with intense interest and already her * has faded from my mind i have forgotten her way of showing * as completely as i always do forget bulwers * oh i understand you now it is like * * has obliterated all other devils you cant fix your mind upon any other the devil always must be of * proportions or you do not believe in him goethes mephistopheles * the crown of the causeway with lucifer but soon you begin to feel that mephistopheles to be a lesser devil an emissary of the devil only is there any cardinal * but shakespeares any mirabeau but carlyles mirabeau but the list is too long of those who have been stamped into your brain by genius the saintly preacher the woman who stands by hetty and * her soul those heavenly minded sermons preached by the author of adam bede bear them well in mind while i tell you how this writer who so well * and * female purity and piety was a governess or something of that sort and perhaps wrote for a living at any rate she had an elective affinity which was responded to by george lewes and so she lives with lewes i do not know that she caused the separation between lewes and his legal wife they are living in a villa on some swiss lake and mrs lewes of the hour is a charitable estimable agreeable sympathetic woman of genius lamar seemed without prejudices on the subject at least he expressed neither surprise nor disapprobation he said something of genius being above law but i was not very clear as to what he said on that point as for me i said nothing for fear of saying too much you know that lewes is a writer said he some people say the man she lives with is a noble man they say she is kind and good * fallen woman here the conversation ended and now comes a grand announcement made by the yankee congress they vote one million of men to be sent down here to free the prisoners whom they will not take in exchange i actually thought they left all these yankees here on our hands as part of their plan to starve us out all congressmen under fifty years of age are to leave politics and report for military duty or be * what enthusiasm there is in their councils confusion rather it seems to me mrs ould says the men who frequent her house are more despondent now than ever since this thing began our congress is so demoralized so confused so depressed they have asked the president whom they have so hated so insulted so crossed and opposed and thwarted in every way to speak to them and advise them what to do both of us were too ill to attend mrs daviss reception it proved a very sensational one first a fire in the house then a * to be an arranged plan of the usual bribed servants there and some escaped yankee prisoners today the examiner is lost in wonder at the stupidity of the fire and * contingent if they had only waited a few hours until everybody was asleep after a reception the household would be so tired and so sound asleep thanks to the editors kind counsel maybe the * contingent will wait and do better next time letters from home carried mr chesnut off today thackeray is dead i stumbled upon vanity fair for myself i had never heard of thackeray before i think it was in 1850 i know i had been ill at the new york hotel and when left alone i slipped downstairs and into a * that i had noticed under the hotel for something to read they gave me the first half of * i can recall now the very kind of paper it was printed on and the illustrations as they took effect upon me and yet when i raved over it and was wild for the other half there were people who said it was slow that thackeray was evidently a coarse dull sneering writer that he stripped human nature bare and made it repulsive etc at mrs * met another beautiful woman mrs penn the wife of colonel penn who is making shoes in a yankee prison she had a little son with her barely two years old a mere infant she said to him * comme butler the child crossed his eyes and made himself hideous then laughed and * around as if he enjoyed the joke * went to mrs daviss it was sad enough fancy having to be always ready to have your servants set your house on fire being bribed to do it such constant * such servants coming and going daily to the yankees carrying ones silver ones other possessions does not conduce to home happiness saw hood on his legs once more he rode off on a fine horse and managed it well though he is disabled in one hand too after all as the woman said he has body enough left to hold his soul how plucky of him to ride a gay horse like that oh a kentuckian * himself upon being half horse and half man and the girl who rode beside him did you ever see a more brilliant beauty three cheers for south carolina i imparted a plan of mine to brewster i would have a breakfast a luncheon a * call it what you please but i would try and return some of the hospitalities of this most hospitable people just think of the dinners suppers breakfasts we have been to people have no variety in war times but they make up for that lack in exquisite cooking variety said he you are hard to please with terrapin stew gumbo

* after the company assembled we waited and waited those girls were making the final arrangements i made my way to the door and as i leaned against it ready to turn the knob mrs stanard held me like coleridges ancient mariner and told how she had been prevented by a violent attack of * from running the blockade and how providential it all was all this floated by my ear for i heard mary prestons voice raised in high protest on the other side of the door stop said she do you mean to take away the whole dish if you eat many more of those fried oysters they will be missed heavens she is running away with a plug a palpable plug out of that jelly cake later in the afternoon when it was over and i was safe for all had gone well and molly had not disgraced herself before the * of those wonderful

church i was to dine with mrs davis he walked so fast i had no breath to talk so i was a good listener for once the truth is i am too much afraid of him to say very much in his presence we had such a nice dinner after dinner hood came for a ride with the president mr hunter of virginia walked home with me he made himself utterly agreeable by dwelling on his friendship and admiration of my husband he said it was high time mr davis should promote him and that he had told mr davis his opinion on that subject today tuesday barny heyward went with me to the presidents reception and from there to a ball at the mcfarlands breckinridge alone of the generals went with us the others went to a supper given by mr clay of alabama i had a long talk with mr ould mr benjamin and mr hunter these men speak

but it came safely mr petigru says you take your money to market in the market basket and bring home what you buy in your pocketbook when lawrence handed me my husbands money six hundred dollars it was i said now i am pretty sure you do not mean to go to the yankees for with that pile of money in your hands you must have known there was your chance he grinned but said nothing at the presidents reception hood had a perfect ovation general preston * him through the crowd handling him as tenderly on his crutches as if he were the princess of * newborn baby that i read of today it is bad for the head of an army to be so helpless but old blcher went to waterloo in a carriage wearing a bonnet on his head to shade his inflamed * heroic figure truly an old * * woman apparently back in a landau and yet blcher to the rescue afterward at the prestons for we left the presidents at an early hour major von borcke was trying to teach them his way of pronouncing his own name and reciting numerous * of it in this country when charles threw open the door saying a gentleman has called for major * the prussian major acknowledged this to be the worst he had heard yet off to the * theatricals i walked with general breckinridge mrs clays mrs * was beyond our wildest hopes and she was in such bitter earnest when she pinched conny carys lydia * shoulder and called her an * little * that lydia showed she felt it and next day the shoulder was black and blue it was not that the actress had a grudge against conny but that she was intense even the back of mrs clays head was eloquent as she walked away but said general breckinridge watch hood he has not seen the play before and bob acres * him when he caught my eye general hood nodded to me and said i believe that fellow acres is a coward thats better than the play whispered breckinridge but it is all good from sir anthony down to * between the acts mrs clay sent us word to applaud she wanted encouragement the audience was too cold general breckinridge responded like a man after that she was fired by thunders of applause following his lead those mighty kentuckians turned * were a host in themselves constance cary not only acted well but looked perfectly beautiful during the farce mrs clay came in with all her feathers diamonds and * and took her seat by me said general breckinridge what a splendid head of hair you have and all my own said she afterward she said they could not get false hair enough so they put a pair of black satin boots on top of her head and piled hair over them we adjourned from mrs * to mrs oulds where we had the usual excellent richmond supper we did not get home until three it was a clear moonlight * as light as day as we walked along i said to general breckinridge you have spent a jolly evening i do not know he answered i have asked myself more than once tonight are you the same man who stood gazing down on the faces of the dead on that awful battlefield the soldiers lying there stare at you with their eyes wide open is this the same world here and there last night the great kentucky contingent came in a body hood brought buck in his carriage she said she did not like general hood and spoke with a wild excitement in those soft blue eyes of * are they gray or brown she then gave her reasons in the lowest voice but loud and distinct enough for him to hear why he spoke so harshly to cy his bodyservant as we got out of the carriage i saw how he hurt * feelings and i tried to soothe * mortification you see cy nearly caused me to fall by his awkwardness and i stormed at him said the general vastly amused i hate a man who speaks roughly to those who dare not resent it said she the general did own himself charmed with her sentiments but seemed to think his * all a good joke he and cy understand each other this party for johnny was the very nicest i have ever had and i mean it to be my last i sent word to the carys to bring their own men they came alone saying they did not care for men that means a raid on ours growled isabella mr lamar was devoted to constance cary he is a free lance so that created no * afterward

pleasant time we had after a while the p m g pet majorgeneral took his seat in the comfortable chair next to mine and declared his determination to hold that position mr hunter and mr benjamin essayed to dislodge him mrs stanard said take him in the flirtation room there he will soon be captured and led away but i did not know where that room was situated besides my bold texan made a most unexpected sally i will not go and i will prevent her from going with any of you supper was near at hand and mr mallory said ask him if the * is not at his house i know it is i started as if i were shot and i took mr clays arm and went in to supper leaving the p m g to the girls venison and everything nice john chesnut had a basket of champagne carried to my house oysters partridges and other good things for a supper after the reception he is going back to the army tomorrow james chesnut arrived on wednesday he has been giving buck his opinion of one of her performances last night she was here and the generals carriage drove up bringing some of our girls they told her he could not come up and he begged she would go down there for a moment she flew down and stood ten minutes in that snow cy holding the carriagedoor open but colonel chesnut there was no harm i was not there ten minutes i could not get in the carriage because i did not mean to stay one minute he did not hold my *

already in some inscrutable way he had become intoxicated he was told to move a chair and he raised it high over his head smashing mrs * chandelier my husband said mary do tell lawrence to go home i am too angry to speak to him so lawrence went without another word he will soon be back and when he comes will say * i knew mars jeems could not do without me and indeed he can not buck reading my

you know you are not childish you have an abundance of strong common sense dont let men adore you * you can help it you are so unhappy about men who care for you when they are killed isabella says that war leads to lovemaking she says these soldiers do more courting here in a day than they would do at home without a war in ten years in the pauses of conversation we hear she is the noblest woman god ever made goodness * isabella which one the amount of courting we hear in these small rooms men have to go to the front and they say their say desperately i am beginning to know all about it the girls tell me and i * can not help it but this style is unique is it not since i saw * * by the turnpike gate you * battlecry has been god my country and you so many are lame major venable says it is not the devil on two sticks now the farce is cupid on crutches general * voice broke in they are my cousins so i determined to kiss them goodby goodby nowadays is the very devil it means forever in all probability you know all the odds against us so i advanced to the charge * discreetly and in the fear of the lord the girls stood in a * of the very prettiest i ever saw sam with his eyes * to the floor cried you were * backed out but i did nothing of the kind i kissed every one of them honestly heartily my husband is writing out some resolutions for the congress he is very busy too trying to get some poor fellows * he says they are good soldiers but got into a scrape buck came in she had on her last winters english hat with the pheasants wing just then hood entered most unexpectedly said the * soldier to the girl you look mighty pretty in that hat you wore it at the turnpike gate where i surrendered at first sight she nodded and smiled and flew down the steps after mr chesnut looking back to say that she meant to walk with him as far as the executive office the general walked to the window and watched until the last flutter of her garment was gone he said the president was finding fault with some of his officers in command and i said mr president why dont you come and lead us yourself i would follow you to the death actually if you stay here in richmond much longer you will grow to be a * and you came a rough texan mrs davis and general * came he tells me * garnett is dead then the best and the cleverest virginian i know is gone he was the most scholarly man they had and his character was higher than his requirements today a terrible onslaught was made upon the president for * burton harrisons and john taylor woods letters denying the charge that the presidents cotton was * or that he left it to be bought by the yankees have enraged the opposition how much these people in the presidents family have to bear i have never felt so indignant saw in mrs howells room the little negro mrs davis rescued yesterday from his brutal negro guardian the child is an orphan he was dressed up in little joes clothes and happy as a lord he was very anxious to show me his wounds and bruises but i fled there are some things in life too sickening and cruelty is one of them somebody said people who knew general hood before the war said there was nothing in him as for losing his property by the war some say he never had any and that west point is a paupers school after all he has only military glory and that he has gained since the war began now said burton harrison only military glory i like that the glory and the fame he has gained during the * is hood what was napoleon before * hood has the * dignity of an indian chief he has always a little court around him of devoted friends wigfall himself has said he could not get within hoods lines found everything in main street twenty per cent dearer they say it is due to the new currency bill i asked my husband is general johnston ordered to reenforce polk they said he did not understand the order after five days delay he replied they say sherman is marching to mobile when they once get inside of our armies what is to molest them unless it be women with * general johnston writes that the governor of georgia refuses him provisions and the use of his roads the governor of georgia writes the roads are open to him and in capital condition i have furnished him abundantly with provisions from time to time as he desired them i suppose both of these letters are placed away side by side in our archives mrs preston was offended by the story of * performance at the ives general breckinridge told her it was the most beautifully unconscious act he ever saw the general was leaning against the wall buck standing guard by him on her two feet the crowd surged that way and she held out her arm to protect him from the rush after they had all passed she handed him his crutches and they too moved slowly away mrs davis said any woman in richmond would have done the same joyfully but few could do it so gracefully buck is made so conspicuous by her beauty whatever she does can not fail to attract attention johnny stayed at home only one day then went to his plantation got several thousand confederate dollars and in the afternoon drove out with mrs k at the bee store he spent a thousand of his money bought us gloves and linen well one can do without gloves but linen is next to life itself yesterday the president walked home from church with me he said he was so glad to see my husband at church had never seen him there before remarked on how well he looked etc i replied that he looked so well because you have never before seen him in the part of the right man in the right place my husband has no fancy for being planted in pews but he is utterly christian in his creed at the presidents where general lee breakfasted a man named * told general lee all he ought to do planned a campaign for him general lee smiled blandly the while though he did permit himself a mild sneer at the wise civilians in congress who refrained from trying the battlefield in person but from afar dictated the movements of armies my husband said that to his amazement general lee came into his room at the executive office to pay his respects and have a talk dear me goodness gracious said i that was a compliment from the head of the army the very first man in the world we confederates think friends came to make * and stayed the livelong day they played cards one man a soldier had only two teeth left in front and they * across each other on account of the condition of his mouth he had maintained a dignified * of aspect though he told some funny stories finally a story was too much for him and he grinned from ear to ear maggie gazed and then called out as the negro * call out dancing figures forward two and cross over fancy our faces the hero of the two teeth * into a * arrangement of mouth said cavalry are the eyes of an army they bring the news the artillery are the boys to make a noise but the infantry do the fighting and a general or so gets all the glory we went to see mrs breckinridge who is here with her husband then we paid our respects to mrs lee her room was like an industrial school everybody so busy her daughters were all there * their needles with several other ladies mrs lee showed us a beautiful sword recently sent to the general by some marylanders now in paris on the blade was engraved aide * et dieu * when we came out someone said did you see how the lees spend their time what a rebuke to the * parties another maimed hero is engaged to be married sally hampton has accepted john haskell there is a story that he reported for duty after his arm was shot off suppose in the fury of the battle he did not feel the pain general breckinridge once asked whats the name of the fellow who has gone to europe for hoods leg dr darby suppose it is * no matter half a dozen are ordered mrs preston raised her hands no wonder the general says they talk of him as if he were a * his leg is in everybodys mouth hetty the handsome and constance the witty came the

ordered his horse it is so near dinner i began but i am going with the president i am on duty he goes to inspect the fortifications the enemy once more are within a few miles of richmond then we prepared a luncheon for him constance cary remained with me after she left i sat down to * and i was absorbed in it how hardened we grow to war and wars alarms the enemys cannon or our own are thundering in my ears and i was dreadfully afraid some infatuated and frightened friend would come in to cheer to comfort and interrupt me am i the same poor soul who fell on her knees and prayed and wept and fainted as the first gun * from fort sumter once more we have repulsed the enemy but it is humiliating indeed that he can come and threaten us at our very gates whenever he so pleases if a forlorn negro had not led them astray and they hanged him for it on tuesday night unmolested they would have walked into richmond surely there is horrid neglect or mismanagement somewhere the enemy has been reenforced and is on us again met wade hampton who told me my husband was to join him with some volunteer troops so i hurried home such a cavalcade rode up to luncheon captain smith lee and preston hampton the handsomest the oldest and the youngest of the party this was at the prestons smith lee walked home with me alarmbells ringing horsemen galloping wagons rattling dr h stopped us to

that the ninth virginia captured him found mrs semmes covering her * and * as calmly as if yankee raiders were a myth while beast butler holds fortress monroe he will make things lively for us on the alert must we be now shopping and paid 30 for a pair of gloves 50 for a pair of slippers 24 for six * of thread # for five miserable shabby little pocket handkerchiefs when i came home found mrs webb at her hospital there was a man who had been taken prisoner by dahlgrens party he saw the negro hanged who had misled them unintentionally in all probability he saw dahlgren give a part of his bridle to hang him details are melancholy as emerson says this dahlgren had also lost a leg constance cary in words too fine for the occasion described the homely scene at my house how i prepared sandwiches for my husband and broke with trembling hand the last bottle of anything to drink in the house a bottle i destined to go with the sandwiches she called it a hector and * performance mrs prestons story as we walked home she told me she had just been to see a lady she had known more than twenty years before she had met her in this wise one of the * of the st charles hotel new orleans told mrs

from a worthless husband now she has one son in a yankee prison one mortally wounded and the last of them dying there under her eyes of consumption this last had married here in richmond not wisely and too soon for he was a mere boy his pay as a private was eleven dollars a month and his wifes family charged him three hundred dollars a month for her board so he had to work double tides do odd

regiment no he must be made a general now says mary preston doctor darby is at the mercy of both yankees and the rolling sea and i am anxious enough but instead of taking my bed and worrying mamma i am taking stock of our worldly goods and trying to arrange the wedding paraphernalia for two girls there is lovemaking and lovemaking in this world what a time the sweethearts of that wretch young shakespeare must have had what experiences of lifes delights must have been his before he evolved the romeo and juliet business from his own internal consciousness also that delicious beatrice and rosalind the poor creature that he left his second best bedstead to came in second best all the time no doubt and she hardly deserved more fancy people wondering that shakespeare and his kind leave no progeny like themselves shakespeares children would have been half his only the other half only the second best bedsteads what would you expect of that * of materials goethe used his * as * are used

all the forms and phases of true love straight to ones heart he goes in tragedy or comedy he never misses fire he has been there in slang phrase no doubt the mans bare presence gave pleasure to the

doubtless found les * * that phrase describes a type of man at a touch it took a * to do it but there is an italian picture of milton taken in his youth and he was as beautiful as an angel no doubt but love flies before everlasting posing and * deadly requirement of a man always to be looked up * domestic tyrant grim formal and awfully learned milton was only a mere man for he could not do without women when he tired out the first poor thing who did not fall down worship and obey him and see god in him and she ran away he immediately arranged his creed so that he could take another wife

sherman may fail as kilpatrick did now if we still had stonewall or albert sidney johnston where joe johnston and polk are i would not give a fig for shermans chances the yankees say that at last they have scared up a man who succeeds and they expect him to remedy all that has gone wrong so they have made their brutal suwarrow grant lieutenantgeneral doctor at the prestons proposed to show me a man who was not an f f v until we came here we had never heard of our social position we do not know how to be rude to people who call to talk of social position seems vulgar down our way that sort of thing was settled one way or another beyond a peradventure like the earth and the sky we never gave it a thought we talked to whom we pleased and if they were not comme il faut we were ever so much more polite to the poor things no reflection on virginia everybody comes to richmond somebody counted fourteen generals in church today and suggested that less piety and more drilling of commands would suit the times better there were lee longstreet morgan hoke clingman whiting pegram elzey gordon and bragg now since dahlgren failed to carry out his orders the yankees * them * all he was not

been expected back she said he was taken prisoner at gettysburg she kept going in and out among them with a basket of provisions she had brought for him to eat it was too pitiful she was utterly

life they were very cheerful we had * some nondescript * icecream on board the band played home sweet home one man tapped another on the shoulder well how do you feel old fellow never was so near crying in my * very comfort governor * a georgian late governor of utah was among the returned prisoners he had been in prison two years his wife was with him he was a * person huge in size and with snowwhite hair fat as a prize ox with no sign of yankee * or starvation about him that evening as we walked up to mrs daviss carriage which was waiting for us at the landing dr garnett with maggie howell major hall with me suddenly i heard her scream and some one stepped back in the dark and said in a whisper little joe he has killed himself i felt reeling faint bewildered a chattering woman clutched my arm mrs daviss son impossible whom did you say was he an interesting child how old was he the shock was terrible and unnerved as i was i cried for gods sake take her away then maggie and i drove two long miles in silence except for * hysterical sobs she was wild with terror the news was broken to her in that abrupt way at the carriage door so that at first she thought it had all happened there and that poor little joe was in the carriage mr burton harrison met us at the door of the executive mansion mrs semmes and mrs barksdale were there too every window and door of the house seemed wide open and the wind was blowing the curtains it was lighted even in the third story as i sat in the drawingroom i could hear the tramp of mr daviss step as he walked up and down the room above not another sound the whole house as silent as death it was then twelve oclock so i went home and waked general chesnut who had gone to bed we went immediately back to the presidents found mrs semmes still there but saw no one but her we thought some friends of the family ought to be in the house mrs semmes said when she got there that little jeff was kneeling down by his brother and he called out to her in great distress mrs semmes i have said all the prayers i know how but god will not wake joe poor little joe the good child of the family was so gentle and affectionate he used to run in to say his prayers at his fathers knee now he was laid out somewhere above us crushed and killed mrs semmes describing the accident said he fell from the high north piazza upon a brick pavement before i left the house i saw him lying there white and beautiful as an angel covered with flowers catherine his nurse flat on the floor by his side was weeping and wailing as only an irishwoman can immense crowds came to the funeral everybody sympathetic but some * and pushing rudely there were thousands of children and each child had a green bough or a bunch of flowers to throw on little joes grave which was already a mass of white flowers crosses and evergreens the morning i came away from mrs daviss early as it was i met a little child with a handful of snow drops put these on little joe she said i knew him so well and then she turned and fled without another word i did not know who she was then or now as i walked home i met mr reagan then wade hampton but i could see nothing but little joe and his brokenhearted mother and mr daviss step still sounded in my ears as he walked that floor the livelong night general lee was to have a grand review the very day we left richmond great numbers of people were to go up by rail to see it miss turner mcfarland writes they did go but they came back faster than they went they found the army drawn up in battle array many of the brave and gay spirits that we saw so lately have taken flight the only flight they know and their bodies are left dead upon the battlefield poor old edward johnston is wounded again and a prisoner joness brigade broke first he was wounded the day before at wilmington we met general whiting he sent us to the station in his carriage and bestowed upon us a bottle of brandy which had run the blockade they say beauregard has taken his sword from whiting never i will not believe it at the capture of fort sumter they said whiting was the brains beauregard only the hand lucifer son of the morning how art thou fallen that they should even say such a thing my husband and mr covey got out at florence to procure for mrs miles a cup of coffee they were slow about it and they got left i did not mind this so very much for i remembered that we were to remain all day at kingsville and that my husband could overtake me there by the next train my maid belonged to the prestons she was only traveling home with me and would go straight on to columbia so without fear i stepped off at kingsville my old confederate silk like most confederate dresses had seen better days and i noticed that like oliver wendell holmess famous * * it had gone to pieces suddenly and all over it was literally in strips i became painfully aware of my forlorn aspect when i asked the telegraph man the way to the hotel and he was by no means respectful to me i was indeed * old and not too * woman it was my first appearance in the character and i laughed aloud a very haughty and highly painted dame greeted me at the hotel no room said she who are you i gave my name try something else said she mrs chesnut dont travel round by herself with no servants and no nothing i looked down there i was dirty tired tattered and torn where do you come from said she my home is in camden come now i know everybody in camden i sat down meekly on a bench in the piazza that was free to all * which mrs chesnut said she sharply i know both i am now the only one and now what is the matter with you do you take me for a spy i know you perfectly well i went to school with you at miss * de * and my name was mary miller the lord sakes alive and to think you are her now i see dear dear me heaven sakes woman but you are broke and tore i added holding up my dress but i had had no idea it was so difficult to effect an entry into a railroad wayside hotel i picked up a long strip of my old black dress torn off by a mans spur as i passed him getting off the train it is sad enough at mulberry without old mrs chesnut who was the good genius of the place it is so lovely here in spring the giants of the * primeval oaks * liveoaks * such as i have not seen since i left * * violets roses and yellow jessamine the air is laden with perfume * the blest was never sweeter inside are creature comforts of all * peas strawberries asparagus spring lamb spring chicken fresh eggs rich yellow butter clean white linen for ones beds

they are as disgusted as he is bragg bragg the head of the war office can not organize in time john boykin has died in a yankee prison he had on a heavy flannel shirt when lying in an open platform car on the way to a cold prison on the lakes a federal soldier wanted johns shirt prisoners have no rights so john had to strip off and hand his shirt to him that caused his death in two days he was dead of * be frozen to death one man said they are taking us there to freeze but then their men will find our hot sun in august and july as deadly as our men find their cold * their snow and ice finish our prisoners at a rapid rate they say napoleons soldiers found out all that in the russian campaign have brought my houseless homeless friends refugees here to * in * plenty i can but remember the lavish kindness of the virginia people when i was there and in a similar condition the virginia people do the * acts of hospitality and never seem to know it is not in the ordinary course of events the presidents man stephen bringing his masters arabian to mulberry for safekeeping said why missis your niggers down here are well off i call this mulberry place heaven with plenty to eat little to do warm house to sleep in a good church john l miller my cousin has been killed at the head of his regiment the blows now fall so fast on our heads they are bewildering the secretary of war * general chesnut to reorganize the men who have been hitherto detailed for special duty and also those who have been exempt he says general chesnut originated the plan and organized the corps of clerks which saved richmond in the dahlgren raid in all this beautiful sunshine in the stillness and shade of these long hours on this piazza all comes back to me about little joe it haunts methat scene in richmond where all seemed confusion madness a bad dream here i see that funeral procession as it wound among those tall white monuments up that hillside the james river tumbling about below over rocks and around islands the dominant figure that poor old grayhaired man standing bareheaded straight as an arrow clear against the sky by the open grave of his son she the bereft mother stood back in her heavy black wrappings and her tall figure drooped the flowers the children the procession as it moved comes and goes but those two dark sorrowstricken figures stand they are before me now that night with no sound but the heavy tramp of his feet overhead the curtains flapping in the wind the gas flaring i was numb stupid halfdead with grief and terror then came * irish howl cheap was that where was she when it all happened her place was to have been with the child who saw him fall whom will they kill next of that devoted household read today the list of killed and wounded one long column was not enough for south carolinas dead i see mr federal secretary stanton says he can reenforce suwarrow grant at his leisure whenever he calls for more he has just sent him 25000 veterans old lincoln says in his quaint * way keep * now we can only peg out what have we left of men etc to meet these reenforcements as often as reenforcements are called for our fighting men have all gone to the front only old men and little boys are at home now it is impossible to sleep here because it is so solemn and still the moonlight shines in my window sad and white and the soft south wind literally comes over a bank of violets lilacs roses with * and magnolia flowers mrs chesnut was only a year younger than her husband he is * or three she was deaf but he retains his senses wonderfully for his great age i have always been an early riser formerly i often saw him sauntering slowly down the broad passage from his room to hers in a flowing flannel dressinggown when it was winter in the spring he was apt to be in shirtsleeves with * hanging down his back he had always a large * in his hand he would take his stand on the rug before the fire in her room * scant locks which were fleecy white her maid would be doing hers which were * brown not a white hair in her head he had the voice of a * and there he stood roaring his morning compliments the people who occupied the room above said he fairly shook the window glasses this pleasant morning greeting ceremony was never omitted her voice was soft and low the * philadelphia seems to have lost the art of sending forth such voices now mrs * old mrs chesnuts sister came among us with the same softly modulated womanly musical voice her clever and beautiful daughters were * judge * said philadelphia women scream like * this morning as i passed mrs chesnuts room the door stood wide open and i heard a pitiful sound the old man was kneeling by her empty bedside sobbing bitterly i fled down the middle walk anywhere out of reach of what was never meant for me to hear we have been to bloomsbury again and hear that william kirkland has been wounded a scene occurred then mary weeping bitterly and aunt b frantic as to * danger i proposed to make arrangements for mary to go on at once the judge took me aside frowning angrily you are unwise to talk in that way she can neither take her infant nor leave it the cars are closed by order of the government to all but soldiers i told him of the woman who when the conductor said she could not go cried at the top of her voice soldiers i want to go to richmond to nurse my wounded husband in a moment twenty men made themselves her bodyguard and she went on unmolested the judge said i talked nonsense i said i would go on in my carriage if need be besides there would be no difficulty in getting mary a permit he answered hotly that in no case would he let her go and that i had better not go back into the house we were on the piazza and my carriage at the door i took it and crossed over to see mary boykin she was weeping too so washed away with tears one would hardly know her so many killed my son and my * do not hear a word from them gave today for two pounds of

danced if any of the lyons family passed him lawrence kept his seat with his hat on too mrs chesnut had said oh so meekly to the whole tirade and added i will see about it colonel * and edmund rhett dined here charming men * brag no detraction talk is never pleasant where there is either our noble georgian dined here he says hampton was the hero of the yankee rout at stony creek he claims that

into this house on the 20th of july my husband was telegraphed to go to charleston general jones sent for him a part of his command is on the coast the girls were at my house everything was in the utmost confusion we were lying on a pile of mattresses in one of the front rooms while the servants were reducing things to order in the rear all the papers are down on the president for this change of commanders except the georgia papers indeed governor browns constant complaints i dare say caused * and the rage of the georgia people as johnston backed down on them isabella soon came she said she saw the preston sisters pass her house and as they turned the corner there was a loud and bitter cry it seemed to come from the hampton house both girls began to run at full speed what is the matter asked mrs martin mother listen that sounded like the cry of a broken heart said isabella something has gone terribly wrong at the prestons mrs martin is deaf however so she heard nothing and thought isabella fanciful isabella hurried over there and learned that they had come to tell mrs preston that willie was * his mothers darling no country ever had a braver soldier a truer gentleman to lay down his life in her cause isabella went with me to the bulletinboard mrs d with the white linen as usual pasted on her chin asked me to read aloud what was there written as i slowly read on i heard a suppressed giggle from isabella i know her way of laughing at everything and tried to * more * read more slowly and louder with more precision as i finished and turned round i found myself closely packed in by a crowd of confederate soldiers eager to hear the news they took off their caps thanked me for reading all that was on the boards and made way for me cap in hand as i hastily returned to the carriage which was waiting for us isabella proposed call out to them to give three cheers for jeff davis and his generals you forget my child that we are on our way to a funeral found my new house already open hospitably to all comers my husband had arrived he was seated at a pine table on which someone had put a coarse red * and by the light of one tallow candle was * entertaining edward barnwell isaac hayne and uncle hamilton he had given them no tea however after i had * that oversight we adjourned to the * piazza by * and the light of the moon we made out that wonderful smile of * which * him as * grey we have laughed so at broken * broken hearts of the foolish love stories but buck now is breaking her heart for her brother willie hearts do break in silence without a word or a sigh mrs means and mary barnwell made no * turned their faces to the wall and died how many more that we know nothing of when i remember all the * the lighthearted the gay and gallant boys who have come laughing singing and dancing in my way in the three years now past how i have looked into their brave young eyes and helped them as i could in every way and then saw them no more forever how they lie stark and cold dead upon the battlefield or * away in hospitals or prisons which is * think if i consider the long array of those bright youths and loyal men who have gone to their death almost before my very eyes my heart might break too is anything worth * fearful sacrifice this awful penalty we pay for war allen g says johnston was a failure now he will wait and see what hood can do before he pronounces judgment on him he liked his address to his army it was grand and inspiring but every one knows a general has not time to write these things himself mr kelly from new orleans says dick taylor and kirby smith have quarreled one would think we had a big enough quarrel on hand for one while already the yankees are enough and to spare general lovell says joe brown with his georgians at his back who * our government to remove joe johnston they are scared now and wish they had not in our democratic republic if one rises to be its head * he * takes a turkish revenge and defiles the tombs of his father and mother hints that his father was a * and his mother no better than she should be his sisters * and worse his brothers yankee * and traitors all this is hurled at lincoln or jeff davis indiscriminately sherman again artillery parked and a line of battle formed before atlanta when we asked brewster what sam meant to do at atlanta he answered * like the man who went he says he means to stay there hope he may thats all spent today with mrs mccord at her hospital she is dedicating her grief for her son sanctifying it one might say by giving up her soul and body her days and nights to the wounded soldiers at her hospital every moment of her time is surrendered to their needs today general taliaferro dined with us he served with hood at the second battle of manassas and at fredericksburg where hood won his majorgenerals spurs on the battlefield hood he said has military inspiration we were thankful for that word all now depends on that army at atlanta if that fails us the game is up yesterday was such a lucky day for my housekeeping in our hired house oh ye kind columbia folk mrs alex taylor ne hayne sent me a huge bowl of yellow butter and a basket to match of every vegetable in season mrs prestons man came with mushrooms freshly cut and mrs tom taylors with fine * sent smith and johnson my house servant and a carpenter from home respectively to the commissarys with our wagon for supplies they made a mistake so they said and went to the depot instead and stayed there all day i needed a servant sadly in many ways all day long but i hope smith and johnson had a good time i did not lose patience until harriet came in an omnibus because i had neither servants nor horse to send to the station for her stephen elliott is wounded and his wife and father have gone to him six hundred of his men were destroyed in a mine and part of his brigade taken prisoners stoneman and his raiders have been captured this last fact gives a slightly different hue to our horizon of unmitigated misery general l told us of an unpleasant scene at the presidents last winter he called there to see mrs mclean mrs davis was in the room and he did not speak to her he did not intend to be rude it was merely an oversight and so he called again and tried to apologize to remedy his blunder but the president was inexorable and would not receive his overtures of peace and goodwill general l is a new york man talk of the * of slavery heavens how perfect are our mens manners down here how suave how polished are they fancy one of them forgetting to speak to mrs davis in her own drawingroom archer came a classmate of my husbands at princeton they called him sally archer then he was so girlish and pretty no trace of feminine beauty about this grim soldier now he has a hard face * and sallow with the saddest black eyes his hands are small white and * his manners quiet he is abstracted and * his mind and body having been * by long imprisonment he seemed glad to be here and james chesnut was charmed dear sally archer he calls him cheerily and the other * in a faroff faded kind of way hood and archer were given the two texas regiments at the beginning of the war they were colonels and wigfall was their general archers comments on hood are he does not compare intellectually with general johnston who is decidedly a man of culture and literary attainments with much experience in military matters hood however has youth and energy to help * all this he has a * directness of purpose always he is awfully shy and he has suffered terribly but then he has had * a rapid rise in his profession and then his luck to be engaged to the beautiful miss they tried archer again and again on the heated controversy of the day but he stuck to his text joe johnston is a fine military critic a capital writer an accomplished soldier as brave as csar in his own person but cautious to a fault in * an army hood has all the dash and fire of a reckless young soldier and his texans would follow him to the death too much caution might be followed easily by too much headlong rush that is where the * of the pendulum might ruin us today general chesnut and his staff departed his troops are ordered to look after the mountain passes beyond greenville on the north carolina and tennessee quarter misery upon misery mobile is going as new orleans went those western men have not held their towns as we held and hold charleston or as the virginians hold richmond and they call us a * * chivalry or a set of dandy miss * they fight desperately in their bloody street * but we bear privation and discipline best we have conflicting testimony young wade hampton of joe johnstons staff says hood lost 12000 men in the battles of the 22d and 24th but brewster of hoods staff says not three thousand at the utmost now here are two people strictly truthful who tell things so differently in this war people see the same things so * one does not know what to believe brewster says when he was in richmond mr davis said johnston would have to be removed and sherman blocked he could not make hardee full general because when he had command of an army he was always * the war department for a generalinchief to be sent there over him polk would not do brave soldier and patriot as he was he was a good soldier and would do his best for his country and do his duty under * was put over him by those in authority mr davis did not once intimate to him who it was that he intended to promote to the head of the western army brewster said today that this blow at joe johnston cutting off his head ruins the schemes of the enemies of the government wigfall asked me to go at once and get hood to decline to take this command for it will destroy him if he accepts it he will have to fight under jeff daviss orders no one can do that now and not lose caste in the western army joe johnston does not exactly say that jeff davis * his plans to the enemy but he says he dares not let the president know his plans as there is a spy in the war office who invariably * the yankees in time consulting the government on military movements is played out thats wigfalls way of talking now added brewster i blame the president for keeping a man at the head of his armies who treats the government with open scorn and * no matter how the people at large rate this disrespectful general began my regular attendance on the wayside hospital today we gave wounded men as they stopped for an hour at the station their breakfast those who are able to come to the table do so the badly wounded remain in wards prepared for them where their wounds are dressed by nurses and surgeons and we take bread and butter beef ham and hot coffee to them one man had hair as long as a womans the result of a vow he said he had pledged himself not to cut his hair until peace was declared and our southern country free four made this vow together all were dead but himself one was killed in missouri one in virginia and he left one at * mountain this poor creature had had one arm taken off at the socket when i remarked that he was utterly disabled and ought not to remain in the army he answered quietly i am of the first texas if old hood can go with one foot i can go with one arm eh how they quarreled and * among * and mississippi all were loud for joe johnston save and except the * onearmed hero who cried at the top of his voice oh you all want to be kept in trenches and to go on retreating eh oh if we had had a leader such as stonewall this war would have been over long ago what we want is a leader shouted a cripple they were awfully * objects of misery wounded maimed diseased i was really upset and came home ill this kind of thing * me quite letters from the army grants dogged stay about richmond is very disgusting and depressing to the spirits wade hampton has been put in command of the southern cavalry a wayside incident a pine box covered with flowers was carefully put upon the train by some gentlemen isabella asked whose remains were in the box dr gibbes replied in that box lies the body of a young man whose family * the *

self so utterly absorbed am i in him there is not a moment day or night that i do not think of him in point of fact i do not think of anything else no reply was deemed necessary by the astounded

father had a hand in building it it was not clean but it was crowded hot and stuffy an eloquent man preached with a delightful voice and wonderful * nearly eloquent and at times nearly ridiculous he

own conversion and stripped himself naked morally all that is very revolting to ones innate sense of decency he * the patriarchs adam noah and so on down to joseph who was a man whose modesty and purity were so transcendent they enabled him to resist the greatest temptation to which fallen man is exposed * that is played out my neighbor whispered everybody gives up now that old mrs pharaoh was

delighted but we did not know enough to be sure when it was his own wisdom or when wise * and cheering words came from the authors of whom he spoke all in a * and yet the news confused as it is seems good from all quarters there is a row in new orleans memphis has been retaken 2000 prisoners have been captured at petersburg and a yankee raid on macon has come to grief at mrs * met a clever mrs calhoun mrs calhoun is a violent * of dick taylor says taylor does the work and kirby smith gets the credit for it mrs calhoun described the behavior of some acquaintance of theirs at * one of that kind whose faith removes mountains her love for and confidence in the confederate army were supreme why not she knew so many of the men who composed that dauntless band when her husband told her new orleans had surrendered to a foe whom she despised she did not believe a word of it he told her to pack up his traps as it was time for him to leave * she then determined to run down to the levee and see for herself only to find the yankee gunboats having it all their own way she made a painful exhibition of herself first she fell on her knees and prayed then she got up and danced with rage then she raved and dashed herself on the ground in a fit there was patriotism run mad for you as i did not know the poor soul mrs calhouns fine acting was somewhat lost on me but the others enjoyed it old edward johnston has been sent to atlanta against his will and archer has been made majorgeneral and contrary to his earnest request ordered not to his beloved texans but to the army of the potomac mr

can hold his own as well as sherman lee has a heavy handful in the new suwarrow he has worse odds than any one else for when grant has ten thousand slain he has only to order another ten thousand and they are there ready to step out to the front they are like the leaves of * i take my hospital duty in the morning most persons prefer afternoon but i dislike to give up my pleasant evenings so i get up at five oclock and go down in my carriage all laden with provisions mrs fisher and old mr bryan generally go with me provisions are commonly sent by people to mrs * i am so glad to be a hospital nurse once more i had excuses enough but at heart i felt a coward and a * i think i know how men feel who hire a substitute and * the fight there must be no dodging of duty it will not do now to send provisions and pay for nurses something inside of me kept calling out go you shabby creature you cant bear to see what those fine fellows have to bear mrs izard was staying with me last night and as i slipped away i begged molly to keep everything dead still and not let mrs izard be disturbed until i got home about ten i drove up and there was a row to wake the dead mollys eldest daughter who nurses her baby sister let the baby fall and regardless of mrs izard as i was away molly was giving the nurse a * in the yard accompanied by howls and yells worthy of a * the small nurse welcomed my advent no doubt for in two seconds peace was restored mrs izard said she sympathized with the babys mother so i forgave the uproar i have excellent servants no matter for their shortcomings behind my back they save me all thought as to household matters and they are so kind attentive and quiet they must know what is at hand if sherman is not hindered from coming * my masters but these sphinxes give no sign unless it be increased diligence and absolute silence as certain in their action and as noiseless as a law of nature at any rate when we are in the house that fearful hospital haunts me all day long and is worse at night so much suffering such loathsome wounds such * with stumps of limbs not half cured exhibited to all then when i was so tired yesterday molly was looking more like an enraged * than anything else roaring that her babys neck was broken and howling cries of vengeance the poor little careless nurses dark face had an * tinge of gray terror she was crouching near the ground like an animal trying to hide and her mother striking at her as she rolled away all this was my welcome as i entered the gate it takes these * but a moment to go back to their naked savage animal nature mrs izard is a charming person she tried so to make me forget it all and rest the battle has been raging at atlanta and our fate hanging in the balance atlanta indeed is gone well that agony is over like david when the child was dead i will get up from my knees will wash my face and comb my hair no hope we will try to have no fear at the prestons i found them drawn up in line of battle every moment looking for the doctor on his way to richmond now to drown thought for our day is done read * * * russia ought to sympathize with us we are not as barbarous as this even if mrs * word be taken brutal men with unlimited power are the same all over the world see russells * run russells they say general morgan has been killed we are hard as stones we sit unmoved and hear any bad news chance may bring are we * my pink silk dress i have sold for 600 to be paid for in * two hundred a month for three months and i sell my eggs and butter from home for two hundred dollars a month does it not sound * hundred dollars a month regularly but in what in confederate money * went with mrs rhett to hear dr palmer i did not know before how utterly hopeless was our situation this man is so eloquent it was hard to listen and not give way despair was his word and martyrdom he offered us nothing more in this world than the martyrs crown he is not for slavery he says he is for freedom and the freedom to govern our own country as we see fit he is against foreign interference in our state matters that is what mr palmer went to war for it appears every day shows that slavery is doomed the world over for that he thanked god he spoke of our agony and then came the cry help us o god vain is the help of man and so we came away shaken to the depths the end has come no doubt of the fact our army has so moved as to uncover macon and augusta we are going to be wiped off the face of the earth what is there to prevent sherman taking general lee in the rear we have but two armies and sherman is between them now these stories of our defeats in the valley fall like blows upon a dead body since atlanta fell i have felt as if all were dead within me forever captain ogden of general chesnuts staff dined here today had ever brigadier with little or no brigade so magnificent a staff the reserves as somebody said have been secured only by robbing the cradle and the * men too old the

everything has rushed into a flirtation with buck such as never was he drives her every day and those wild runaway sorrel * * my soul as they go tearing * and darting from side to side of the street and my lady enjoys it when he leaves her he kisses her hand bowing so low to do it unseen that we see it all * president will be with us here in columbia next tuesday so colonel mclean brings us word i have begun at once to prepare to receive him in my small house his apartments have been decorated as well as confederate * would permit the possibilities were not great but i did what i could for our honored chief besides i like the * has been so kind to me and his wife is one of the few to whom i can never be grateful enough for her generous appreciation and attention i went out to the gate to greet the president who met me most cordially kissed me in fact custis lee and governor lubbock were at his back immediately after breakfast the presidential party arrived a little before daylight general chesnut drove off with the presidents aides and mr davis sat out on our piazza there was nobody with him but myself some little boys strolling by called out come here and look there is a man on mrs chesnuts porch who looks just like jeff davis on * people began to gather at once on the street mr davis then went in mrs mccord sent a magnificent * thought of course for the president but she gave me such a scolding afterward she did not know he was there i in my mistake about the bouquet thought she knew and so did not send her word the president was watching me prepare a mint * for custis lee when colonel mclean came to inform us that a great crowd had gathered and that they were coming to ask the president to speak to them at one oclock an immense crowd it * women and children the crowd overflowed the house the presidents hand was nearly shaken off i went to the rear my head intent on the dinner to be prepared for him with only a confederate commissariat but the patriotic public had come to the rescue i had been gathering what i could of * for a month and now i found that nearly everybody in columbia was sending me whatever they had that they thought nice enough for the presidents dinner we had the * madeira from mulberry and the beautiful old china etc mrs preston sent a boned turkey stuffed with * stuffed tomatoes and stuffed * each made a dish as pretty as it was appetizing a mob of small boys only came to pay their respects to the president he seemed to know how to meet that odd delegation then the presidents party had to go and we bade them an affectionate farewell custis lee and i had spent much time gossiping on the back porch while i was * dainties for the dessert he sat on the banister with a cigar in his mouth he spoke very candidly telling me many a hard truth for the confederacy and about the bad time which was at hand ten pleasant days i owe to my sister kate has descended upon me unexpectedly from the mountains of flat rock we are true sisters she understands me without words and she is the cleverest sweetest woman i know so graceful and gracious in manner so good and unselfish in character but best of all she is so agreeable any time or place would be charming with kate for a companion general chesnut was in camden but i could not wait i gave the beautiful bride mrs darby a dinner which was simply perfection i was satisfied for once in my life with my own table and i know pleasanter guests were never seated around any table whatsoever my house is always crowded after all what a number of pleasant people we have been thrown in with by wars * i call such society glorious it is the * but the old life as it begins to die will die royally general chesnut came back disheartened he complains that such a life as i lead gives him no time to think burton harrison writes to general preston that supreme anxiety reigns in richmond oh for one single port if the alabama had had in the whole wide world a port to take her prizes to and where she could be * i believe she would have borne us through oh for one single port by which we could get at the outside world and * our whole confederacy if we could have hired regiments from europe or even have imported ammunition and food for our soldiers some days must be dark and dreary at the * however i saw an instance of faith in our future a brides paraphernalia and the radiant bride herself the bridegroom expectant and elect now within twenty miles of chattanooga and outward bound to face the foe saw at the * not only lizzie hamilton a perfect little beauty but the very table the first declaration of independence was written upon these * are grandchildren of henry * of the first revolution alas we have yet to make good our second declaration of * * yankee meddling and yankee rule hood has written to ask them to send general chesnut out to command one of his brigades in whose place if albert sidney johnston had lived poor old general lee has no backing stonewall would have saved us from antietam sherman will now catch general lee by the rear while grant holds him by the head and while hood and thomas are performing an indian * on the frontier hood means to cut his way to lee see if he doesnt the yanks have had a struggle for it more than once we seemed to have been too much for them we have been so near to success it aches one to think of it so runs the tabletalk next to our house which isabella calls * since mr daviss visit is a common of green grass and very level beyond which comes a belt of pinetrees on this open space within forty paces of us a regiment of foreign deserters has camped they have taken the oath of allegiance to our government and are now being drilled and disciplined into form before being sent to our army they are mostly germans with some irish however their close proximity keeps me miserable traitors once traitors forever jordan has always been held responsible for all the foolish proclamations and indeed for whatever beauregard reported or proclaimed now he has left that mighty chief and lo here comes from beauregard the * and most boastful of his military * he * of shiloh that was not the way the story was told to us a letter from mrs davis who says thank you a thousand times my dear friend for your more than maternal kindness to my dear child that is what she calls her sister maggie howell as to mr davis he thinks the best ham the best madeira the best coffee the best hostess in the world rendered columbia delightful to him when he passed through we are in a sad and anxious state here just now the dead come in but the living do not go out so fast however we hope all things and trust in god as the only one able to resolve the opposite state of feeling into a triumphant happy whole i had a surprise of an unusually gratifying nature a few days since i found i could not keep my horses so i sold them the next day they were returned to me with a handsome anonymous note to the effect that they had been bought by a few friends for me but i fear i can not feed them strictly between us things look very anxious here sally hampton went to richmond with the rev mr martin she arrived there on wednesday on thursday her father wade hampton fought a great battle but just did not win * victory narrowly missed darkness * and impenetrable woods prevented that longedfor consummation preston hampton rode recklessly into the hottest fire his father sent his brother wade to bring him back wade saw him reel in the saddle and galloped up to him general hampton following as young wade reached him preston fell from his horse and the one brother stooping to raise the other was himself shot down preston recognized his father but died without speaking a word young wade though wounded held his brothers head up tom taylor and others hurried up the general took his dead son in his arms kissed him and handed his body to tom taylor and his friends bade them take care of wade and then rode back to his post at the head of his troops in the thickest of the fray he directed the fight for the rest of the day until night he did not know young * fate that boy might be dead too now he says no son of his must be in his command when wade * he must join some other division the agony of such a day and the anxiety and the duties of the * is all more than a mere man can bear another letter from mrs davis she says i was dreadfully shocked at preston hamptons * untimely fate i know nothing more touching in history than general hamptons situation at the * moment of his misery when he sent one son to save the other and saw both fall and could not know for some moments whether both were not killed a thousand dollars have slipped through my fingers already this week at the commissarys i spent five hundred today for candles sugar and a lamp etc tallow candles are bad enough but of them there seems to be an end too now we are restricted to * * * is a preparation of * when the chimney of the lamp cracks as crack it will we plaster up the place with paper thick old * preferring the highly glazed kind in the hunt for paper queer old letters come to light sherman in atlanta has left thomas to take care of hood hood has thirty thousand men thomas forty thousand and as many more to be had as he wants he has only to ring the bell and call for them grant can get all that he wants both for himself and for thomas all the world is open to them while we are shut up in a bastile we are at sea and our boat has sprung a * although sherman took atlanta he does not mean to stay there be it heaven or hell fire and the sword are for us here that is the word and now i must begin my columbia life anew and alone it will be a short * captain ogden came to dinner on sunday and in the afternoon asked me to go with him to the presbyterian church and hear mr palmer we went and i felt very youthful as the country people say like a girl and her beau ogden took me into a pew and my husband sat afar off what a sermon the preacher stirred my blood my very flesh crept and * a redhot glow of patriotism passed through me such a sermon must strengthen the hearts and the hands of many people there was more exhortation to fight and die la joshua than meek christianity sherman is thundering at * very doors my general was on the wing * and full of care the girls are merry enough the staff who fairly live here no better cassandra with a black shawl over her head is chased by the gay crew from sofa to sofa for she * them being full of miserable anxiety there is nothing but distraction and confusion all things tend to the preparation for the departure of the troops it rains all the time such rains as i never saw before incessant torrents these men come in and out in the red mud and * of columbia streets things seem dismal and wretched to me to the last degree but the staff the girls and the youngsters do not see it mrs s born in connecticut came and she was radiant she did not come to see me but my nieces she says exultingly that sherman will open a way out at last and i will go at once to europe or go north to my relatives there how she derided our misery and mocked when our fear cometh i dare say she takes me for a fool i sat there dumb although she was in my own house i have heard of a woman so enraged that she struck some one over the head with a shovel today for the first time in my life i know how that mad woman felt i could have given mrs s the benefit of shovel and * both that splendid fellow preston hampton home they brought their warrior dead and wrapped in that very legion flag he had borne so often in battle with his own hands a letter from mrs davis today under date of richmond va november 20 1864 she says affairs west are looking so critical now that before you receive this you and i will be in the depths or else triumphant i confess i do not * success in every passing breeze but i am so tired hoping fearing and being disappointed that i have made up my mind not to be disconsolate even though thieves break through and steal some people expect another attack upon richmond shortly but i think the avalanche will not slide until the spring breaks up its winter quarters i have a blind kind of * of victory for us but somehow i am not cheered the temper of congress is less vicious but more concerted in its hostile action mrs davis is a woman that my heart aches for in the troubles ahead my journal a quire of confederate paper lies wide open on my desk in the corner of my drawingroom everybody reads it who chooses buck comes regularly to see what i have written last and makes faces when it does not suit her isabella still calls me cassandra and puts her hands to her ears when i begin to wail well cassandra only records what she hears she does not vouch for it for really one nowadays never feels certain of anything we dined at mrs mccords she is as strong a cordial for broken spirits and failing heart as one could wish how her strength contrasts with our weakness like doctor palmer she strings one up to bear bravely the worst she has the intellect of a man and the perseverance and endurance of a woman we have lost nearly all of our men and we have no money and it looks as if we had taught the yankees how to fight since manassas our best and bravest are under the sod we shall have to wait till another generation grows up here we stand despair in our hearts oh cassandra dont shouts isabella with our houses burning or about to be over our heads the north have just got things * a splendid army perfectly disciplined with new levies coming in day and night their gentry do not go into the ranks they hardly know there is a war up there at coosawhatchie yankees are landing in great force our troops down there are raw militia old men and boys never under fire before some college cadets in all a mere handful the cradle and the grave have been robbed by us they say sherman goes to savannah and not to augusta isabella and i put on bonnets and shawls and went deliberately out for news we determined to seek until we found met a man who was so ugly i could not forget him or his sobriquet he was awfully in love with me once he did not know me but blushed hotly when isabella told him who i was he had forgotten me i hope or else i am changed by age and care past all recognition he gave us the encouraging information that * had been burned to the ground when the call for horses was made mrs mccord sent in her fine bays she comes now with a pair of mules and looks too long and significantly at my ponies if i were not so much afraid of her i would hint that those mules would be of far more use in camp than my ponies but they will seize the ponies no doubt in all my life before the stables were far off from the house and i had nothing to do with them now my ponies are kept under an open shed next to the back piazza here i sit with my work or my desk or my book basking in our southern sun and i watch nat feed * and rub down the horses and then he * their stables as thoroughly as smith does my drawingroom i see their beds of straw comfortably laid nat says * missis aint ladys business to look so much in de stables i care nothing for his grumbling and i have never had horses in better condition poor ponies you deserve every attention and enough to eat grass does not grow under your feet by night and day you are on the trot today general chesnut was in charleston on his way from augusta to savannah by rail the telegraph is still working between charleston and savannah * certainly is burned there was fighting down there today i came home with enough to think about heaven knows and then all day long we * a pound cake in honor of mrs cuthbert who has things so nice at home the cake was a success but was it worth all that trouble as my party were driving off to the concert an omnibus rattled up enter captain * of general chesnuts staff of as imposing a presence as a fieldmarshal handsome and grayhaired he was here on some military errand and brought me a letter he said the yankees had been repulsed and that down in those swamps we could give a good account of ourselves if our government would send men enough with a sufficient army to meet them down there they could be annihilated where are the men to come from asked mamie wildly general hood has gone off to tennessee even if he does defeat thomas there what difference would that make here we drank tea at mrs mccords she had her troubles too the night before a country cousin claimed her hospitality one who fain would take the train at five this morning a little after midnight mrs mccord was startled out of her first sleep by loud ringing of bells an alarm at night may mean so much just now in an instant she was on her feet she found her guest who thought it was daylight and wanted to go mrs mccord forcibly demonstrated how foolish it was to get up five hours too soon mrs mccord once more in her own warm bed had fallen happily to sleep she was waked by feeling two * hands pass cautiously over her face and person it was pitch dark even mrs mccord gave a scream in her fright she found it was only the irrepressible guest up and at her again so though it was only three oclock in order to quiet this perturbed spirit she rose and at five drove her to the station where she had to wait some hours but mrs mccord said anything for peace at home the restless people who will not let others rest miss olivia middleton and mr frederick * are to be married we confederates have invented the * for the wedding night isabella calls it the wake not the wedding of the parties married the ceremony will be performed early in the evening the whole company will then sit up until five oclock at which hour the bridal couple take the train for * hope sherman will not be so * as to cut short the honeymoon in tripped brewster with his hat on his head both hands extended and his greeting well here we are he was travelstained * grimy with dirt the prophet would have to send him many times to bathe in jordan before he could be pronounced clean hood will not turn and pursue sherman thomas is at his heels with forty thousand men and can have as many more as he wants for the asking between thomas and sherman hood would be crushed so he was * do not remember where or what i know there was no comfort in anything he said * account of money spent paper and envelopes # tickets to concert 1000 toothbrush 1000 total # and now the young ones are in bed and i am wide awake it is an odd thing in all my life how many persons have i seen in love not a halfdozen and i am a tolerably close observer a faithful watcher have i been from my youth upward of men and manners society has been for me only an enlarged field for character study flirtation is the business of society that is playing at lovemaking it begins in vanity it ends in vanity it is spurred on by idleness and a want of any other excitement flattery * and * how in this game flattery is dashed backward and forward it is so soothing to * if it begins and ends in vanity vexation of spirit * sometimes they do occasionally burn their fingers awfully playing with fire but there are no hearts broken each party in a flirtation has secured a sympathetic listener to whom he or she can talk of himself or * who for the time admires one exclusively and as the french say * it is a pleasant but very foolish game and so to bed hood and thomas have had a fearful fight with carnage and loss of generals excessive in proportion to numbers that means they were leading and urging their men up to the enemy i know how bartow and barnard bee were killed bringing up their men one of mr chesnuts sins thrown in his teeth by the legislature of south carolina was that he procured the promotion of gist state rights gist by his influence in richmond what have these comfortable * patriots to say of general gist now and how could man die better than facing fearful odds etc so fort * has fallen goodby savannah our governor announces himself a follower of joe brown of georgia another famous joe the deep waters are closing over us and we are in this house like the * at the time of the flood we care for none of these things we eat drink laugh dance in lightness of heart doctor trezevant came to tell me the dismal news how he piled on the agony desolation mismanagement despair general young with the flower of hamptons cavalry is in columbia horses can not be found to mount them neither the governor of georgia nor the governor of south carolina is moving hand or foot they have given up the yankees claim another victory for thomas hope it may prove like most of their victories brag and * cant say why maybe i am benumbed but i do not feel so intensely miserable oh why did we go to camden the very * christmas overtook us there miss rhett went with usa brilliant woman and very agreeable the world you know is composed said she of men women and rhetts see lady * now we feel that if we are to lose our negroes we would as soon see sherman free them as the confederate government freeing negroes is the last confederate government * we are a little too slow about it that is all sold fifteen bales of cotton and took a sad farewell look at mulberry it is a magnificent old * with old oaks green lawns and all so i took that last farewell of mulberry once so hated now so beloved sherman is at * and hood in tennessee the last of his men not gone as louis wigfall so cheerfully prophesied serena went for a halfhour today to the dentist her teeth are of the whitest and most regular simply perfection she fancied it was better to have a dentist look in her mouth before returning to the mountains for that look she paid three hundred and fifty dollars in confederate money why has this money any value at all she asked little enough in all truth sad to say brewster was here and stayed till midnight said he must see general chesnut he had business with him his me and general hood is no longer comic he described shermans march of destruction and desolation sherman leaves a track fifty miles wide upon which there is no living thing to be seen said brewster before he departed you do the * business when you want to get out of the enemys country and the * business when they want to get into your country but we retreated in our own country and we gave up our mountain passes without a blow but never mind the greeks if we had only our own game cock sumter our own swamp fox marion * men or sumters or the equivalent of them now lie under the sod in virginia or tennessee yesterday i broke * way to abject terror under the news of shermans advance with no news of my husband today while wrapped up on the sofa too dismal even for moaning there was a loud knock shawls on and all just as i was i rushed to the door to find a telegram from my husband all well be at home tuesday it was dated from adams run i felt as lighthearted as if the war were over then i looked at the date and the * run it ends as it * a * run from which their first sprightly running astounded the world and now adams run but if we must run who are left to run from bull run they ran * but we have fought until maimed soldiers women and children are all that remain to run today kershaws brigade or what is left of it passed through what shouts greeted it and what bold shouts of thanks it returned it was all a very encouraging noise absolutely comforting some true men are left after all my husband is at home once * how long i do not know his aides fill the house and a group of hopelessly wounded haunt the place the drilling and the marching go on outside it rains a flood with freshet after freshet the forces of nature are * us for our enemies have to make their way through swamps a month ago my husband wrote me a letter which i promptly suppressed after showing it to mrs mccord he warned us to make ready for the end had come our resources were exhausted and the means of resistance could not be found we could not bring ourselves to believe it and now he thinks with the railroad all blown up the swamps made impassable by the * which have no time to * so constant is the rain and the negroes utterly apathetic would they be so if they saw us triumphant if we had but an army to seize the opportunity we might do something but there are no troops that is the real trouble today mrs mccord exchanged # in confederate bills for # in * thousand for three hundred the * for the benefit of the hospitals opens now sherman marches constantly all the railroads are smashed and if i laugh at any mortal thing it is that i may not weep generals are as plenty as blackberries but none are in command the peace commissioner blair came they say he gave mr davis the kiss of peace and we send stephens campbell all who have believed in this thing to negotiate for peace no hope no good who dares hope * excitement in church a great railroad character was called out he soon returned and whispered something to joe johnston and they went out together somehow the whisper moved around to us that sherman was at * grant us patience good lord was prayed aloud not ulysses grant good lord murmured * profanely hood came yesterday he is staying at the prestons with jack they sent for us what a heartfelt greeting he gave us he can stand well enough without his crutch but he does very slow walking how plainly he spoke out dreadful words about nay defeat and discomfiture my army destroyed my losses etc etc he said he had nobody to blame but himself a telegram from beauregard today to my husband he does not know whether sherman intends to advance on * charleston or columbia isabella said maybe you attempted the impossible and began one of her * stories jack preston touched me on the arm and we slipped out he did not hear a word she was saying he has forgotten us all did you notice how he stared in the fire and the lurid spots which came out in his face and the drops of perspiration that stood on his forehead yes he is going over some bitter scene he sees willie preston with his heart shot away he sees the panic at nashville and the dead on the battlefield at franklin that agony on his face comes again and again said tenderhearted jack i cant keep him out of those absent fits governor * and general winder talk of preparations for a defense of columbia if beauregard cant stop sherman down there what have we got here to do it with can we check or impede his march can any one last night general hampton came in i am sure he would do something to save us if he were put in supreme command here hampton says joe johnston is equal if not superior to lee as a commanding officer my silver is in a box and has been delivered for safe keeping to isaac * who is really my beauideal of a grateful negro i mean to trust him my husband cares for none of these things now and lets me do as i please tom archer died almost as soon as he got to richmond prison takes the life out of men he was only * when here he had a strange pallid look and such a vacant stare until you roused him poor pretty sally archer that is the end of you * n c february 16 #* change has come oer the spirit of my dream dear old quire of yellow coarse confederate homemade paper here you are again an age of anxiety and suffering has passed over my head since last i wrote and wept over your forlorn pages my ideas of those last days are confused the martins left columbia the friday before i did and mammy the negro woman who had nursed them refused to go with them that daunted me then mrs mccord who was to send her girls with me changed her mind she sent them upstairs in her house and actually took away the staircase that was her plan then i met mr christopher hampton arranging to take off his sisters they were flitting but were to go only as far as * he said it was time to move on sherman was at * barely a days journey from columbia and had left a track as bare and blackened as a fire leaves on the prairies so my time had come too my husband urged me to go home he said camden would be safe enough they had no spite against that old town as they have against charleston and columbia molly weeping and wailing came in while we were at table wiping her redhot face with the cooks grimy apron she said i ought to go among our own black people on the plantation they would take care of me better than any one else so i agreed to go to mulberry or the hermitage plantation and sent lawrence down with a wagonload of my valuables then a miss patterson * refugee from tennessee she had been in a country overrun by yankee invaders and she described so graphically all the horrors to be endured by those subjected to fire and sword rapine and plunder that i was fairly scared and determined to come here this is a thoroughly * place and yet i can go to charlotte am halfway to kate at flat rock and there is no federal army between me and richmond as soon as my mind was finally made up we telegraphed to lawrence who had barely got to camden in the wagon when the telegram was handed to him so he took the train and came back mr chesnut sent him with us to take care of the party we thought that if the negroes were ever so loyal to us they could not protect me from an army bent upon sweeping us from the face of the earth and if they tried to do so so much the worse would it be for the poor things with their yankee friends i then left them to shift for themselves as they are accustomed to do and i took the same liberty my husband does not care a fig for the property question and never did perhaps if he had ever known poverty it would be different he talked beautifully about it as he always does about everything i have told him often that if at heavens gate st peter would listen to him a while and let him tell his own story he would get in and the angels might give him a crown extra now he says he has only one * i should be safe and not so harassed with dread and then there is his blind old father a man said he can always die like a patriot and a gentleman with no fuss and take it coolly it is hard not to envy those who are out of all this their difficulties * who have met death gloriously on the battlefield their doubts all solved one can but do his best and leave the result to a higher power after new orleans those vain passionate impatient little * were forever committing suicide driven to it by despair and beast butler as we read these things mrs davis said if they want to die why not first kill beast butler rid the world of their foe and be saved the trouble of * themselves that practical way of removing their intolerable burden did not occur to them i repeated this suggestive anecdote to our corps of generals without troops here in this house as they spread out their maps on my table where lay this quire of paper from which i write every man jack of them had a safe plan to stop sherman if even beauregard and lee were expected but grant had * on lee lee could not save his * could he come to save us read the list of the dead in those last battles around richmond and petersburg if you want to break your heart i took french leave of * away without a word to anybody isaac hayne and mr chesnut came down to the charlotte depot with me ellen my maid left her husband and only child but she was willing to come and indeed was very cheerful in her way of looking at it i wan travel roun wid missis some * * molly goin all de time a woman fifty years old at least and * than she was old sharply rebuked my husband for standing at the car window for a last few words with me she said rudely stand aside sir i want air with his hat off and his grand air my husband bowed politely and said in one moment madam i have something important to say to my wife she talked aloud and introduced herself to every man claiming his protection she had never traveled alone before in all her life old age and ugliness are protective in some cases she was ardently patriotic for a while then she was joined by her friend a man as crazy as herself to get out of this from their talk i gleaned she had been for years in the treasury department they were about to cross the lines the whole idea was to get away from the trouble to come down here they were yankees but were they not spies here i am brokenhearted and an exile and in such a place we have bare floors and for a * pine table and two chairs i pay 30 a day such sheets but fortunately i have some of my own at the door before i was well out of the hack the woman of the house packed lawrence back neck and heels she would not have him at any price she treated him as mr fs aunt did * in little * she said his clothes were too fine for a nigger his airs indeed poor lawrence was humble and silent he said at last miss mary send me back to mars jeems i began to look for a pencil to write a note to my husband but in the flurry could not find one here is one said lawrence producing one with a gold case go away she shouted i want no niggers here with gold * and airs so lawrence fled before the storm but not before he had begged me to go back he said if mars jeems knew how you was treated hed never be willing for you to stay here the martins had seen my to them wellknown traveling case as the hack trotted up main street and they arrived at this juncture out of breath we embraced and wept i kept my room the * are refugees here too they are virginians and have been in exile since the second battle of manassas poor things they seem to have been everywhere and seen and suffered everything they even tried to go back to their own house but found one chimney only standing alone even that had been taken possession of by a yankee who had written his name upon it the day i left home i had packed a box of flour sugar rice and coffee but my husband would not let me bring it he said i was coming to a land of * north carolina where the foot of the yankee * was unknown and in columbia they would need food now i have written for that box and many other things to be sent me by lawrence or i shall starve the middletons have come how joyously i sprang to my feet to greet them mrs ben rutledge described the * in columbia everybody was flying in every direction like a flock of * she heard the enemys guns booming in the distance the train no longer runs from charlotte to columbia miss middleton possesses her soul in peace she is as cool clever rational and entertaining as ever and we talked for hours mrs reed was in a state of despair i can well understand that sinking of mind and body during the first days as the abject misery of it all closes in upon you i remember my suicidal tendencies when i first came here here i am thank god settled at the mcleans in a clean comfortable room airy and * with a grateful heart i stir up my own bright wood fire my bill for four days at this splendid hotel here was # with 25 additional for fire but once more my lines have fallen in pleasant places as we came up on the train from charlotte a soldier took out of his pocket a filthy rag if it had lain in the gutter for months it could not have looked worse he unwrapped the thing carefully and took out two biscuits of the species known as hard tack then he gallantly handed me one and with an * smile asked me to take some then he explained saying please take these two * with me give me something softer that i can eat i am very weak still immediately for his benefit my basket of luncheon was emptied but as for his biscuit i would not choose any isabella asked but what did you say to him when he poked them under your nose and i replied i held up both hands saying i would not take from you anything that is * from it i would not touch them for worlds a tremendous days work and i helped with a will our window glass was all to be washed then the brass andirons were to be polished after we rubbed them bright how pretty they were presently ellen would have none of me she was * the floor you * a good * stay to miss * till de * dry i am very docile now and i obeyed orders the * say all the trouble at the hotel came from our servants bragging they represented us as millionaires and the middleton men servants smoked cigars mrs reeds averred that he had never done anything in his life but stand behind his master at table with a silver waiter in his hand we were charged accordingly but perhaps the landlady did not get the best of us after all for we paid her in confederate money now that they wont take confederate money in the shops here how are we to live miss middleton says quartermasters families are all clad in good gray cloth but the soldiers go naked well we are like the families of whom the novels always say they are poor but honest poor wellnigh beggars are we for i do not know where my next meal is to come from called on mrs ben rutledge today she is lovely exquisitely refined her mother mrs middleton came in you are not looking well dear anything the matter * mamma i have not eaten a mouthful today the children can eat * i cant i drank my tea however she does not understand taking favors and blushing violently refused to let me have ellen make her some biscuit i went home and sent her some biscuit all the same isabella has been reading my diaries how we laugh because my sage * all come to naught my famous insight into character is utter folly the diaries were lying on the hearth ready to be burned but she told me to hold on to them think of them a while and dont be rash afterward when isabella and i were taking a walk general joseph e johnston joined us he explained to us all of lees and stonewall jacksons mistakes we had nothing to * could we say anything he said he was very angry when he was ordered to take command again he might well have been in a genuine rage this on and off * would be enough to * the * head mrs johnston knows how to be a * of joe johnston and still not make his enemies uncomfortable she can be pleasant and agreeable as she was to my face a letter from my husband who is at charlotte he came near being taken a prisoner in columbia for he was asleep the morning of the 17th when the yankees blew up the railroad depot that woke him of course and he found everybody had left columbia and the town was surrendered by the mayor colonel goodwyn hampton and his command had been gone several hours isaac hayne came away with general chesnut there was no fire in the town when they left they overtook hamptons command at * mill that night from the hills where they encamped they saw the fire and knew the yankees were burning the town as we had every reason to expect they would molly was left in charge of everything of mine including mrs prestons cow which i was keeping and sally * furniture charleston and wilmington have surrendered i have no further use for a newspaper i never want to see another one as long as i live wade hampton has been made a lieutenantgeneral too late if he had been made one and given command in south carolina six months ago i believe he would have saved us shame disgrace * all have come at once and are hard to * grand smash rain rain outside and naught but drowning floods of tears inside i could not bear it so i rushed down in that rainstorm to the martins rev mr martin met me at the door madam said he columbia is burned to the ground i bowed my head and sobbed aloud stop that he said trying to speak cheerfully come here wife said he to mrs martin this woman cries with her whole heart just as she laughs but in spite of his words his voice broke down and he was hardly calmer than myself i want to get to kate i am so utterly heartbroken i hope john chesnut and general chesnut may at least get into the same army we seem scattered over the face of the earth isabella sits there calmly reading i have quieted down after the days * may our heavenly father look down on us and have pity they say i was the last refugee from columbia who was allowed to enter by the door of the cars the government took possession then and women could only be smuggled in by the windows stout ones stuck and had to be pushed pulled and hauled in by main force dear mrs izard with all her dignity was subjected to this rough treatment she was found almost too much for the size of the car windows the * who live opposite us here are descendants of those * who came south with mr chesnuts ancestors after the fort * disaster they have now therefore been driven out of their eden the valley of virginia a second time the present * is the great man the rich man par excellence of lincolnton they say that with something very near to tears in his eyes he heard of our latest defeats it is only a question of time with us now he said the raiders will come you know in washington before i knew any of them except by sight mrs davis mrs emory and mrs johnston were always together inseparable friends and the trio were pointed out to me as the cleverest women in the united states now that i do know them all well i think the world was right in its estimate of them met a mr ancrum of serenely cheerful aspect happy and hopeful all right now said he sherman sure to be thrashed joe johnston is in command dr darby says when the * joseph the * gave up his command to hood he remarked with a smile i hope you will be able to stop sherman it was more than i could do general johnston is not of mr * way of thinking as to his own powers for he stayed here several days after he was ordered to the front he must have known he could do no good and i am of his opinion when the wagon in which i was to travel to flat rock drove up to the door covered with a * white cloth in my embarrassment for an opening in the conversation i asked the drivers name he showed great hesitation in giving it but at last said my name is sherman adding and now i see by your face that you wont go with me my name is against me these times here he grinned and remarked but you would leave lincolnton that name was the last drop in my cup but i gave him mrs * reason for staying here general johnston had told her this might be the safest place after all he thinks the yankees are making straight for richmond and general lees rear and will go by camden and lancaster leaving lincolnton on their west flank the mcleans are kind people they ask no rent for their * 20 a week for firewood twenty dollars and such * waste paper mrs munroe took up my photograph book in which i have a picture of all the yankee generals i want to see the men who are to be our masters said she not mine i answered thank god come what may this was a free fight we had as much right to fight to get out as they had to fight to keep us in if they try to play the masters anywhere upon the habitable globe will i go never to see a yankee and if i die on the way so much the better then i sat down and wrote to my husband in language much worse than anything i can put in this book as i wrote i was blinded by tears of rage indeed i nearly wept myself away mrs munroe offered me religious books which i declined being already provided with the * of * the * of david the denunciations of * and above all the patient wail of job job is my comforter now i should be so thankful to know life never would be any worse with me my husband is well and has been ordered to join the great * i am bodily comfortable if somewhat * * and i daily part with my raiment for food we find no one who will exchange * for confederate money so we are devouring our clothes opportunities for social enjoyment are not wanting miss middleton and isabella often drink a cup of tea with me one might search the whole world and not find two * or more agreeable women miss middleton is brilliant and accomplished she must have been a hard student all her life she knows everybody worth knowing and she has been everywhere then she is so highbred * pure and true she is so * she could not harbor a wrong thought she is utterly unselfish a devoted daughter and sister she is one among the many * women a kind providence has thrown in my way such as mrs mccord daughter of judge cheves mary preston darby mrs emory granddaughter of old franklin the american wise man and mrs jefferson davis how i love to praise my friends as a ray of artificial sunshine mrs munroe sent me an examiner daniel thinks we are at the last gasp and now england and france are bound to step in england must know if the united states of america are triumphant they will * her next and france must wonder if she will not have to give up mexico my faith fails me it is all too late no help for us now from god or man thomas daniel says was now to * georgia but sherman from all accounts has done that work once for all there will be no * they say no living thing is found in shermans track only chimneys like telegraph poles to carry the news of shermans army backward in all that tropical downpour mrs munroe sent me * and an umbrella with the message come over i went for it would be as well to drown in the streets as to hang myself at home to my own * at mrs * i met a miss mcdaniel her father for seven years was the methodist preacher at our negro church the negro church is in a grove just opposite mulberry house she says her father has so often described that fine old establishment and its beautiful lawn liveoaks etc now i dare say there stand at mulberry only shermans * of chimneys we have made up our minds for the worst mulberry house is no doubt * to the ground miss mcdaniel was inclined to praise us she said as a general rule the episcopal minister went to the family mansion and the methodist missionary preached to the negroes and dined with the overseer at his house but at mulberry her father always stayed at the house and the family were so kind and attentive to him it was rather pleasant to hear ones family so spoken of among strangers so well equipped to brave the weather armed * so to speak i continued my prowl farther afield and brought up at the middletons i may have surprised them for at such an inclement season they hardly expected a visitor never however did lonely old woman receive such a warm and hearty welcome now we know the worst are we growing hardened we avoid all allusion to columbia we never speak of home and we begin to * the certain poverty that lies ahead how it pours could i live many days in solitary confinement things are beginning to be unbearable but i must sit down and be satisfied my husband is safe so far let me be thankful it is no worse with me but there is the gnawing pain all the same what is the good of being here at all our world has simply gone to destruction and across the way the fair lydia * she has not even my resources against ennui she has no isabella no miss middleton two as brilliant women as any in christendom oh how does she stand it i mean to go to church if it rains cats and dogs my feet are wet two or three times a day we never take cold our hearts are too hot within us for that a carriage was driven up to the door as i was writing i began to tie on my bonnet and said to myself in the glass oh you lucky woman i was all in a tremble so great was my haste to be out of this mrs * had the carriage she came for me to go and hear mr martin preach he lifts our spirits from this dull earth he takes us up to heaven that i will not deny still he can not hold my attention my heart * and my mind * back to south carolina oh vandal sherman what are you at there hardhearted wretch that you are a letter from general chesnut who writes from camp near charlotte under date of february 28th i thank you a thousand thousand times for your kind letters they are now my only earthly comfort except the hope that all is not yet lost we have been driven like a wild herd from our country and it is not from a want of spirit in the people or soldiers nor from want of energy and * in our commanders the restoration of joe johnston it is hoped will * to the advantage of our cause and the * of our fortunes i am still in not very agreeable circumstances for the last four days completely * i am informed that a detachment of yankees were sent from liberty hill to camden with a view to destroying all the houses mills and provisions about that place no particulars have reached me you know i expected the worst that could be done and am fully prepared for any report which may be made it would be a happiness beyond expression to see you even for an hour i have heard nothing from my poor old father i fear i shall never see him again such is the fate of war i do not complain i have deliberately chosen my lot and am prepared for any fate that awaits me my care is for you and i trust still in the good cause of my country and the justice and mercy of * it was a lively rushing young set that south carolina put to the fore they knew it was a time of imminent danger and that the fight would be ten to one they expected to win by activity energy and enthusiasm then came the wet blanket the croakers now these are posing wrapping csars mantle about their heads to fall with dignity those gallant youths who dashed so gaily to the front lie mostly in bloody graves well for them maybe there are worse things than honorable graves wearisome thoughts late in life we are to begin anew and have laborious difficult days ahead we have contradictory testimony governor aiken has passed through saying sherman left columbia as he found it and was last heard from at * dr * walked home with me he says that is the last version of the story now my husband wrote that he himself saw the fires which burned up columbia the first night his camp was near enough to the town for that they say sherman has burned * sherman nightmare that * that * but i do not believe it he takes his time there are none to molest him he does things leisurely and deliberately why stop to do so needless a thing as burn lancaster courthouse the jail and the tavern as i remember it that description covers lancaster a raiding party they say did for camden no train from charlotte yesterday rumor says sherman is in charlotte trying to brave it out they have plenty yet let our men freeze and starve in their prisons would you be willing to be as wicked as they are a thousand times no but we must feed our army * we can do so much as that our captives need not starve if lincoln would consent to exchange prisoners but men are nothing to the united * to throw away if they send our men back they strengthen our army and so again their policy is to keep everybody and everything here in order to help starve us out that too is what shermans destruction * starve us out young * asked me to play accompaniments for him the guitar is my instrument or was so i sang and played to my own great delight it was a distraction then i made eggnog for the soldier boys below and came home have spent a very pleasant evening * dull care you and i never agree ellen and i are shut up here it is rain rain everlasting rain as our money is worthless are we not to starve heavens how grateful i was today when mrs mclean sent me a piece of chicken i think the * of my larder has * out today mrs munroe sent me hot cakes and eggs for my breakfast is the sea * up is it going up into mist and coming down on us in a * the rain it * every day the weather * our tearful despair on a large scale it is also lent * quite convenient custom for we in truth have nothing to eat so we fast and pray and go dragging to church like drowned rats to be preached at my letter from my husband was * what in a woman you would call heartbroken that i began to get ready for a run up to charlotte my hat was on my head my * in my hand and ellen was saying which umbrella maam stop ellen said i someone is speaking out there a tap came at the door and miss mclean threw the door wide open as she said in a triumphant voice permit me to announce general chesnut as she went off she sang out oh does not a meeting like this make amends we went after luncheon to see mrs munroe my husband wanted to thank her for all her kindness to me i was awfully proud of him i used to think that everybody had the air and manners of a gentleman i know now that these accomplishments are things to thank god for father * came in fresh from columbia and with news at last shermans men had burned the convent mrs munroe had pinned her faith to sherman because he was a roman catholic but father * was there and saw it the nuns and girls marched to the old hampton house mrs prestons now and so saved it they walked between files of soldiers men were rolling tar barrels and lighting torches to fling on the house when the nuns came columbia is but dust and ashes burned to the ground men women and children have been left there homeless houseless and without one particle of * to picking up corn that was left by shermans horses on picket grounds and * it to stay their hunger how kind my friends were on this my fte day mrs rutledge sent me a plate of biscuit mrs munroe nearly enough food supplies for an entire dinner miss mclean a cake for dessert ellen cooked and served up the material happily at hand very nicely indeed there never was a more successful dinner my heart was too full to eat but i was quiet and calm at least i spared my husband the trial of a broken voice and tears as he stood at the window with his back to the room he said where are they * old blind father and my sister day and night i see her leading him out from under his own * that picture pursues me persistently but come let us talk of pleasanter things to which i answered where will you find them he took off his heavy cavalry boots and ellen carried them away to wash the mud off and dry them she brought them back just as miss middleton walked in in his agony while struggling with those huge boots and trying to get them on he spoke to her * in french she turned away from him instantly as she saw his shoeless plight and said to me i had not heard of your happiness i did not know the general was here not until next day did we have time to remember and laugh at that outbreak of french miss middleton answered him in the same language he told her how charmed he was with my surroundings and that he would go away with a much lighter heart since he had seen the kind people with whom he would leave me i asked my husband what that correspondence between sherman and hampton * while i was preparing something for our dinner his back was still turned as he gazed out of the window he spoke in the low and steady monotone that characterized our conversation the whole day and yet there was something in his voice that thrilled me as he said the second day after our march from columbia we passed the ms he was a * man and not at home his wife said at first that she could not find forage for our horses but afterward she succeeded in procuring some i noticed a very handsome girl who stood beside her as she spoke and i suggested to her mother the propriety of sending her out of the track of both armies things were no longer as heretofore there was so much straggling so many camp followers with no discipline on the outskirts of the army the girl answered quickly i wish to stay with my mother that very night a party of wheelers men came to our camp and such a tale they told of what had been done at the place of horror and destruction the mother left raving the outrage had been committed before her very face she having been secured first after this crime the fiends moved on there were only seven of them they had been gone but a short time when wheelers men went in pursuit at full speed and overtook them cut their throats and wrote upon their breasts these were the seven but the girl oh she was dead are his critics as violent as ever against the president asked i when recovered from pity and horror sometimes i think i am the only friend he has in the world at these dinners which they give us everywhere i spoil the sport for i will not sit still and hear jeff davis abused for things he is no more responsible for than any man at that table once i lost my temper and told them it sounded like arrant nonsense to me and that jeff davis was a gentleman and a patriot with more brains than the assembled company you lost your temper truly said i and i did not know it i thought i was as cool as i am now in washington when we left jeff davis ranked second to none in intellect and may be first from the south and mrs davis was the friend of mrs emory mrs joe johnston and mrs montgomery blair and others of that circle now they rave that he is nobody and never was and she i asked oh you would think to hear them that he found her yesterday in a mississippi swamp well in the french revolution it was worse when a man failed he was * mirabeau did not die a day too soon even mirabeau he is gone with despair in my heart i left that railroad station allan green walked home with me i met his wife and his four ragged little boys a day or so ago she is the neatest the primmest the softest of women her voice is like the gentle cooing of a dove that lowering black future hangs there all the same the end of the war brings no hope of peace or of security to us ellen said i had a little piece of bread and a little molasses in store for my dinner today today came a * even a small piece of bread and the molasses had become things of the past my larder was empty when a tall mulatto woman brought a tray covered by a huge white * ellen ushered her in with a flourish saying mrs * maid the maid set down the tray upon my bare table and uncovered it with conscious pride there were fowls ready for * * butter bread eggs and preserves i was dumb with delight after silent thanks to heaven my powers of speech returned and i exhausted myself in messages of gratitude to mrs mcdaniel missis you * to let her see how glad you was said ellen it was a * of yosef down mrs * gave me some yarn and i bought five dozen eggs with it from a * for lent to show that i have faith yet in humanity i paid in advance in yarn for something to eat which they promised to bring tomorrow had they * their eggs at 100 a dozen in * money i would have paid it as readily as 10 but i * in yarn for the * part of a thread two weeks have passed and the rumors from columbia are still of the * no letter has come from there no direct message or messenger my god cried dr frank miles but it is strange can it be anything so dreadful they dare not tell us dr st * * has grown pale and haggard with care his wife and children were left there dr * has at last been coaxed into selling me enough leather for the making of a pair of shoes else i should have had to give up walking he knew my father well he intimated that in some way my father helped him through college his own money had not sufficed and so william c preston and my father advanced funds sufficient to let him be graduated then my uncle charles miller married his aunt i listened in rapture for all this tended to leniency in the leather business and i bore off the leather gladly when asked for confederate money in trade i never stop to bargain i give them 20 or 50 cheerfully for * sum colonel childs came with a letter from my husband and a newspaper containing a full account of shermans * brutality in columbia then we walked three miles to return the call of my benefactress mrs mcdaniel they were kind and hospitable at her house but my heart was like lead my head ached and my legs were worse than my head and then i had a nervous chill so i came home went to bed and stayed there until the * brought me a letter saying my husband would be here today then i got up and made ready to give him a cheerful reception soon a man called troy by name the same who kept the little corner shop so near my house in columbia and of whom we bought things so often we had * he now shook hands with me and looked in my face * we seemed to have been friends all our lives he says they stopped the fire at the methodist college perhaps to save old mr * house mr sheriff dent being burned out took refuge in our house he contrived to find favor in yankee eyes troy relates that a yankee officer snatched a watch from mrs mccords bosom the soldiers tore the bundles of clothes that the poor wretches tried to save from their burning homes and dashed them back into the flames they meant to make a clean sweep they were howling round the fires like demons these yankees in their joy and triumph at our destruction well we have given them a big scare and kept them miserable for four * little handful of us a woman we met on the street stopped to tell us a painful coincidence a general was married but he could not stay at home very long after the wedding when his baby was born they telegraphed him and he sent back a rejoicing answer with an inquiry is it a boy or a girl he was killed before he got the reply was it not sad his poor young wife says he did not live to hear that his son lived the kind woman added sorrowfully died and did not know the sect of his child let us hope it will be a methodist said isabella the irrepressible at the venison feast isabella heard a good word for me and one for general chesnuts air of distinction a thing people can not give themselves try as ever they may lord byron says everybody knows a gentleman when he sees one and nobody can tell what it is that makes a gentleman he knows the thing but he cant describe it now there are some french words that can not be translated and we all know the thing they * and * for instance as applied to a woman not that anything was said of me like * from it i am fair fat forty and jolly and in my unbroken * as far as they know they found my charm you see she doesnt howl she doesnt cry she never never tells anybody about what she was used to at home and what she has lost high praise and i intend to try and deserve it ever after went to church crying to ellen it is lent we must fast and pray when i came home my good fairy colonel childs had been here bringing rice and potatoes and promising flour he is a trump he pulled out his pocketbook and offered to be my banker he stood there on the street miss middleton and isabella witnessing the generous action and straight out offered me money no put up that said i i am not a beggar and i never will be to die is so much easier alas after that flourish of trumpets when he came with a sack of flour i accepted it gratefully i receive things i can not pay for but money is different there i draw a line imaginary perhaps once before the same thing happened our letters of credit came slowly in 1845 when we went unexpectedly to europe and our letters were to follow us i was a poor little * bride and a british officer who guessed our embarrassment for we did not tell him he came over with us on the ship asked my husband to draw on his banker until the letters of credit should arrive it was a nice thing for a stranger to do we have never lost what we never had we have never had any * unlimited credit for my husbands richest kind of a father insured us all manner of credit it was all a mirage only at last and it has gone just as we drew nigh to it colonel childs says eight of our senators are for reconstruction and that a ray of light has penetrated inward from lincoln who told judge campbell that southern land would not be confiscated better today a long long weary day in grief has passed away i suppose general chesnut is * where that is the question only once has he visited this sad spot which holds he says all that he cares for on earth unless he comes or writes soon i will cease or try to cease this wearisome looking looking looking for him my husband at last did come for a visit of two hours brought lawrence who had been to camden and was there indeed during the raid my husband has been ordered to chester s c we are surprised to see by the papers that we behaved heroically in leaving everything we had to be destroyed without one thought of surrender we had not thought of ourselves from the heroic point of view isaac * hid and saved everything we trusted him with a grateful negro is isaac lawrence says miss chesnut is very proud of the presence of mind and cool selfpossession she showed in the face of the enemy she lost after all only two bottles of champagne two of her brothers * canes and her brothers horses including * the brood mare that he valued beyond price and her own carriage and a * boy called * whose occupation in life was to stand behind the table with his peacock feathers and brush the flies away he was the sole member of his dusky race at mulberry who deserted ole marster to follow the yankees now for our losses at the hermitage added to the * canes and * we lost every mule and horse and president daviss beautiful arabian was captured johns were there too my light dragoon johnny and heavy swell is stripped light enough for the fight now jonathan whom we trusted betrayed us and the plantation and mills mulberry house etc were saved by * that black rascal who was suspected by all the world * boldly affirmed that mr chesnut would not be hurt by destroying his place the invaders would hurt only the negroes mars jeems said he hardly ever come here and he takes only a little * * to eat when he do come fever continuing i sent for st * * we had a * over the slavery question then he fell foul of everybody who had not conducted this war according to his ideas ellen had something nice to offer him thanks to the * childs but he was too angry too anxious too miserable to eat he pitched into ellen after he had disposed of me ellen stood glaring at him from the fireplace her blue eye nearly white her other eye blazing as a comet last sunday he gave her some * powders for me directions were written on the paper in which the medicine was wrapped and he told her to show these to me then to put what i should give her into a wineglass and let me drink it ellen put it all into the wineglass and let me drink it at one dose it was enough to last you your lifetime he said it was murder turning to ellen what did you do with the directions i * see no * you * * none i told you to show that paper to your mistress well i flung dat ole brown paper in de fire what you * all dis fuss for soon as i give missis de * she stop * an * bout she go to sleep sweet as a * baby an she * two days an nights an now she heap better and ellen withdrew from the controversy well all is well that ends well mrs chesnut you took opium enough to kill several persons you were worried out and needed rest you came near getting * you were in no danger from your disease but your doctor and your nurse combined were deadly maybe i was saved by the * the feebleness of confederate medicine a letter from my husband written at chester court house on march 15th says in the morning i send * ogden with lawrence to lincolnton to bring you down i have three vacant rooms one with bedsteads chairs * basins and pitchers the two others bare you can have half of a kitchen for your cooking i have also at dr da * a room furnished to which you are invited board also you can take your choice if you can get your friends in lincolnton to assume charge of your valuables only bring such as you may need here perhaps it will be better to bring bed and bedding and the other * hester s c march 21 #* flitting has occurred captain ogden came for me the splendid childs was true as steel to the last surely he is the kindest of men captain ogden was slightly incredulous when i depicted the wonders of colonel * generosity so i skilfully led out the good gentleman for inspection and he walked to the train with us he offered me confederate money silver and gold and finally offered to buy our cotton and pay us now in gold of course i laughed at his overflowing bounty and accepted nothing but i begged him to come down to chester or camden and buy our cotton of general chesnut there on the train after leaving lincolnton as captain ogden is a refugee has had no means of communicating with his home since new orleans fell and was sure to know how refugees contrive to live i beguiled the time acquiring information from him when people are without a cent how do they live i asked i am about to enter the noble band of homeless houseless refugees and confederate pay does not buy ones * to which he replied sponge sponge why did you not let colonel childs pay your bills i have no bills said i we have never made bills anywhere not even at home where they would trust us and nobody would trust me in lincolnton why did you not borrow his money general chesnut could pay him at his leisure i am by no means sure general chesnut will ever again have any money said i as the train rattled and * along and i waved my handkerchief in farewell to miss middleton isabella and other devoted friends i could only wonder if fate would ever throw me again with such kind clever agreeable congenial companions the mcleans refused to be paid for their rooms no * can sound the depths of the hospitality and kindness of the north carolina people misfortune dogged us from the outset everything went wrong with the train we broke down within two miles of charlotte and had to walk that distance which was pretty rough on an invalid barely out of a fever my spirit was further broken by losing an invaluable lace veil which was worn because i was too poor to buy a cheaper * is if there were any veils at all for sale in our region my husband had ordered me to a house in charlotte kept by some great friends of his they established me in the drawingroom a really handsome apartment they made up a bed there and put in a washstand and plenty of water with everything * clean and nice but it continued to be a public drawingroom open to all so that i was half dead at night and wanted to go to bed the piano was there and the company played it the landlady announced proudly that for supper there were nine kinds of custard custard sounded nice and light so i sent for some but found it heavy potato pie i said ellen this may kill me though * powder did not dont you believe dat missis try we * ourselves in the drawingroom that night and left the next day at dawn arrived at the station we had another disappointment the train was behind time there we sat on our boxes nine long hours for the cars might come at any moment and we dared not move an inch from the spot finally the train rolled in * with paroled prisoners but heaven helped us a kind mail agent invited us with two other forlorn women into his comfortable and clean * ogden true to his theory did not stay at the boardinghouse as we did some christian acquaintances took him in for the night this he explained with a grin my husband was at the chester station with a carriage we drove at once to mrs da * i have been ill but what could you expect my lines however have again fallen in pleasant places mrs da vega is young handsome and agreeable a kind and perfect hostess and as to the house my room is all that i could ask and leaves nothing to be desired so very fresh clean warm and comfortable is it it is the drawingroom suddenly made into a bedroom for me but it is my very own we are among the civilized of the earth once more i have moved again and now i am looking from a window high with something more to see than the sky we have the third story of dr da * house which opens on the straight street that leads to the railroad about a mile off mrs * is the loveliest of young widows yesterday at church isaac hayne nestled so close to her * that i had to touch him and say sit up josiah * was killed in that famous fight of the charleston light dragoons the dragoons stood still to be shot down in their tracks having no orders to retire they had been forgotten doubtless and they scorned to take care of themselves in this high and airy retreat as in richmond then in columbia and then in lincolnton my cry is still if they would only leave me here in peace and if i were sure things never could be worse with me again am i surrounded by old friends people seem to vie with each other to show how good they can be to me today smith opened the trenches and appeared laden with a tray covered with a snowwhite * here was my first help toward housekeeping again mrs pride has sent a boiled ham a loaf of bread a huge * another neighbor coffee already parched and ground a loaf of sugar already cracked candles pickles and all the other things one must trust to love for now such money as we have * us nothing even if there were anything left in the shops to buy we had a jolly luncheon james lowndes called the best of good company he said of buck she is a queen and ought to reign in a palace no prince charming yet no man has yet approached her that i think half good enough for her then mrs * hamilton ne levy came with the story of family progress not a royal one from columbia here before we left home said she major hamilton spread a map of the united states on the table and showed me with his finger where sherman was likely to go * i demurred i but suppose he does not choose to go that way pooh pooh what do you know of war so we set out my husband myself and two children all in one small buggy the 14th of february we took up our line of march and straight before shermans men for five weeks we fled together by incessant hurrying and scurrying from pillar to post we succeeded in acting as a sort of * of the yankee army without rest and with much haste we got here last wednesday and here we mean to stay and defy sherman and his legions much the worse for wear were we the first night their beauty sleep was rudely broken into at alston with a cry move on the yanks are upon us so they hurried on * to winnsboro but with no better luck there they had to lighten the ship leave trunks etc and put on all sail for this time the yankees were only five miles behind whip and spur ride for your life was the cry shermans objective point seemed to be our buggy said she for you know that when we got to lancaster sherman was expected there and he keeps his appointments that is he kept that one two small children were in our chariot and i began to think of the red sea expedition but we lost no time and soon we were in * clearly out of the track we thanked god for all his mercies and hugged to our bosoms fond hopes of a bed and bath so much needed by all especially for the children at twelve oclock general hardee himself knocked us up with word to march march for all the blue bonnets are over the border in mad haste we made for fayetteville when they said god bless your soul this is the seat of war now the battleground where sherman and johnston are to try conclusions so we * back as the hunters say and cut across country aiming for this place clean clothes my dear never a one except as we took off garment by garment and washed it and dried it by our camp fire with our * girded and in haste i was snug and comfortable all that time in lincolnton today stephen d lees corps marched * to surrender the camp songs of these men were a heartbreak so sad yet so stirring they would have warmed the blood of an * the leading voice was powerful mellow clear distinct pathetic sweet so i sat down as women have done before when they hung up their harps by strange streams and i wept the bitterness of such weeping music away away thou * to me of things which in all my long life i have not found and i shall not find there they go the gay and gallant few doomed the last gathering of the flower of southern pride to be killed or worse to a prison they continue to prance by light and jaunty they march with as airy a tread as if they still believed the world was all on their side and that there were no yankee bullets for the unwary what will joe johnston do with them now the hood * is over though the curtain has not fallen on the last scene cassandra * and makes many mistakes but today she believes that hood stock is going down when that style of enthusiasm is on the * the rapidity of its extinction is miraculous it is like the * out of a candle one moment white then gone forever no that is not right it is the * on the river that is referred to i am getting things as much mixed as do the fine ladies of society lee and johnston have each fought a drawn battle only a few more dead bodies lie stiff and stark on an unknown battlefield for we do not so much as know where these drawn battles took place * barnwell after sharing with me my first luncheon failed me cruelly he was to come for me to go down to the train and see isabella pass by one word with isabella worth a thousand ordinary ones so she has gone by and ive not seen her old colonel chesnut refuses to say grace but as he leaves the table audibly declares i thank god for a good dinner when asked why he did this odd thing he said my way is to be sure of a thing before i return thanks for it mayor goodwyn thanked sherman for promised protection to columbia soon after the burning began i received the wife of a postoffice robber the poor thing had done no wrong and i felt so sorry for her who would be a woman who that fool a weeping pining faithful woman she hath hard measures still when she hopes kindest and all her beauty only makes * i was awakened with a bunch of violets from mrs pride violets always remind me of kate and of the sweet south wind that blew in the garden of paradise part of my life then it all came back the dread unspeakable that lies behind every thought now * find i have not spoken of the * which held the preston party that day on their way to york from richmond in the party were mr and mrs lawson clay general and mrs preston and their three daughters captain * and mr portman whose father is an english earl and connected financially and happily with portman square in my american ignorance i may not state mr * case plainly mr portman is of course a younger son then there was * and her baby and * with no end of servants male and female in this ark they slept ate and drank such being the fortune of war we were there but a short time but mr portman during that brief visit of ours was said to have eaten three luncheons and the number of his drinks * so called were counted too mr * contribution to the larder had been three small pigs they were however run over by the train and made sausage meat of unduly and before their time general lee says to the men who * duty this is the peoples war when they tire i stop wigfall says it is all over the game is up he is on his way to texas and when the hanging begins he can step over into mexico i am * up heart such troops do i see go by every day they must turn the tide and surely they are going for something more than surrender it is very late and the wind * my curtain which seems to moan too late all this will end by making me a nervous lunatic yesterday while i was driving with mrs pride colonel * passed us he called out i do hope you are in comfortable quarters very comfortable i replied oh mrs chesnut said mrs pride how can you say that perfectly comfortable and hope it may never be worse with me said i i have a clean little parlor 16 by 18 with its bare floor well * a dinnertable six chairs * that is all but i have a charming lookout from my window high my world is now thus divided into two * yankees are and where yankees are not as i sat disconsolate looking out ready for any new tramp of men and arms the magnificent figure of general preston * in sight he was mounted on a mighty steed worthy of its rider followed by his trusty squire william walker who bore before him the generals * when i had time to realize the situation i perceived at general prestons right hand mr christopher hampton and mr portman who passed by soon mrs pride in some occult way divined or heard that they were coming here and she sent me at once no end of good things for my teatable general preston entered very soon after and with him clement clay of alabama the latter in pursuit of his wifes trunk i left it with the rev mr martin and have no doubt it is perfectly safe but where we have written to mr martin to inquire then wilmot de saussure appeared i am here he said to consult with general chesnut he and i always think alike he added emphatically slavery is stronger than ever if you think so said i you will find that for once you and general chesnut do not think alike he has held that slavery was a thing of the past this many a year i said to general preston i pass my days and nights partly at this window i am sure our army is silently * men are moving the wrong way all the time they slip by with no songs and no shouts now they have given the thing up see for yourself look there for a while the streets were thronged with soldiers and then they were empty again but the marching now is without tap of drum mr * hamilton told us of a great adventure mrs preston was put under his care on the train he soon found the only other women along were strictly unfortunate females as carlyle calls them beautiful and aggressive he had to communicate the unpleasant fact to mrs preston on account of their * and was lost in admiration of her silent dignity her quiet selfpossession her calmness her * and blindness her thoroughbred ignoring of all that she did not care to see some women no matter how ladylike would have made a fuss or would have * but mrs preston dominated the situation and possessed her soul in innocence and peace met robert johnston from camden he has been a prisoner having been taken at camden the yankees robbed * cantey of his forks and spoons when * did not seem to like it they laughed at him when he said he did not see any fun in it they pretended to weep and wiped their eyes with their * all this maddening derision * said was as hard to bear as it was to see them ride off with his horse * they stole all of mrs * jewelry and silver when the yankee general heard of it he wrote her a very polite note saying how sorry he was that she had been annoyed and returned a bundle of * * written to her before she was married robert johnston said miss chesnut was a brave and determined spirit one yankee officer came in while they were at breakfast and sat down to warm himself at the fire rebels have no rights miss chesnut said to him politely i suppose you have come to rob us please do so and go your presence * my blind old father the man jumped up in a rage and said what do you take me fora robber no indeed said she and for very shame he marched out * saw general preston ride off he came to tell me goodby i told him he looked like a * on his great white horse with william his squire at his heels our men are all consummate riders and have their servants well mounted behind them carrying cloaks and * different from the same men packed like sardines in dirty railroad cars usually floating inch deep in liquid tobacco * for the kitchen and * comfort i wanted a pine table and a kitchen chair a woman sold me one today for three thousand confederate dollars mrs hamilton has been disappointed again * hamilton says the person into whose house they expected to move today came to say she could not take boarders for three reasons first that they had smallpox in the house and the two others oh i did not ask for the two others miss middletons letter came in answer to mine telling her how generous my friends here were to me we long she says for our own small sufficiency of wood corn and vegetables here is a struggle unto death although the neighbors continue to feed us as you would say with a spoon we have fallen upon a new device we keep a cookery book on the mantelpiece and when the dinner is deficient we just read off a pudding or a * it does not entirely satisfy the appetite this dessert in imagination but perhaps it is as good for the digestion as i was ready to go though still upstairs some one came to say general hood had called mrs hamilton cried out send word you are not at home never said i why make him climb all these stairs when you must go in five minutes if he had come here dragging sherman as a captive at his chariot wheels i might say not at home but not now and i ran down and greeted him on the sidewalk in the face of all and walked slowly beside him as he toiled up the weary three stories limping gallantly he was so well dressed and so cordial not depressed in the slightest he was so glad to see me he calls his report selfdefense says joe johnston attacked him and he was obliged to state things from his point of view and now follow statements where one may read between the lines what one chooses he had been offered a command in western virginia but as general lee was concerned because he and joe johnston were not on cordial terms and as the fatigue of the mountain campaign would be too great for him he would like the chance of going across the mississippi texas was true to him and would be his home as it had voted him a * somewhere out there they say general lee is utterly despondent and has no plan if richmond goes as go it must richmond has fallen and i have no heart to write about it grant broke through our lines and sherman cut through them stoneman is this side of danville they are too many for us everything is lost in richmond even our archives blue black is our horizon hood says we shall all be obliged to go * texas i mean for our own part of the country will be overrun yes a solitude and a wild waste it may become but as to that we can rough it in the bush at home de fontaine in his newspaper continues the old cry now richmond is given up he says it was too heavy a load to carry and we are stronger than ever stronger than ever * of our army are under ground and where is another army to come from will they wait until we grow one what a week it has * sadness anxiety turmoil ceaseless excitement the wigfalls passed through on their way to texas we did not see them * told hood they were bound for the rio grande and intended to shake hands with maximilian emperor of mexico yankees were expected here every minute mrs davis came we went down to the cars at daylight to receive her she dined with me lovely winnie the baby came too buck and hood were here and that queen of women mary darby clay behaved like a trump he was as devoted to mrs davis in her adversity as if they had never quarreled in her prosperity people sent me things for mrs davis as they did in columbia for mr davis it was a luncheon or breakfast only she stayed for here mrs brown prepared a dinner for her at the station i went down with her she left here at five oclock my heart was like lead but we did not give way she was as calm and smiling as ever it was but a brief glimpse of my dear mrs davis and under altered skies a letter from mrs davis who writes do come to me and see how we get on i shall have a spare room by the time you arrive indifferently furnished but oh so affectionately placed at your service you will receive such a loving welcome one perfect bliss have i the baby who grows fat and is smiling always is christened and not old enough to develop the worlds vices or to be snubbed by it the name so long delayed is * anne my name is a heritage of woe are you delighted with your husband i am delighted with him as well as with my own it is well to lose an arabian horse if one * such a tender and at the same time knightly letter as general chesnut wrote to my poor old * i do not think that for a time he felt the vultures after the reception of the generals letter i hear horrid reports about richmond it is said that all below ninth street to the * has been burned by the rabble who * the town the yankee performances have not been chronicled may god take our cause into his own hands just now when mr clay dashed upstairs pale as a sheet saying general lee has * i saw it reflected in mary * face before i heard him speak she staggered to the table sat down and wept aloud mr clays eyes were not dry quite beside herself mary shrieked now we belong to negroes and yankees buck said i do not believe it how different from ours of them is their estimate of us how contradictory is their attitude toward us to keep the despised and * south within their borders as part of their country they are willing to enlist millions of men at home and abroad and to spend * and we know they do not love fighting per se nor spending money they are perfectly willing to have three killed for our one we hear they have all grown rich through * whatever that is genuine yankees can make a fortune trading * somehow it is borne in on me that we will have to pay the piper was remarked today no blood can not be squeezed from a * you can not pour anything out of an empty cup we have no money even for taxes or to be confiscated while the preston girls are here my diningroom is given up to them and we camp on the landing with our one table and six chairs beds are made on the diningroom floor otherwise there is no furniture except * of water and * in their improvised chamber night and day this landing and these steps are crowded with the lite of the confederacy going and coming and when night comes or rather bedtime more beds are made on the floor of the landingplace for the warworn soldiers to rest upon the whole house is a bivouac as pickens said of south carolina in 1861 we are an armed camp my husband is rarely at home i sleep with the girls and my room is given up to soldiers general lees few but undismayed his remnant of an army or the part from the south and west sad and crestfallen pass through chester many discomfited heroes find their way up these stairs they say johnston will not be caught as lee was he can retreat that is his trade if he would not fight sherman in the hill country of georgia what will he do but retreat in the plains of north carolina with grant sherman and thomas all to the fore we are to stay here running is useless now so we mean to * a yankee raid which they say is imminent why fly they are everywhere these yankees like red * like the * and frogs which were the * of egypt the plucky way in which our men keep up is beyond praise there is no howling and our poverty is made a matter of laughing we * our own penury of the country we try not to speak at all this yellow confederate quire of paper my journal blotted by entries has been buried three days with the silver * * * and a few spoons and forks that follow my fortunes as i wander with these valuables was hoods silver cup which was partly crushed when he was wounded at chickamauga it has been a wild three days with aides galloping around with messages yankees hanging over us like a sword of damocles we have been in queer straits we sat up at mrs * dressed without once going to bed for fortyeight hours and we were * colonel * jones came with a despatch a sealed secret despatch it was for general chesnut i opened it lincoln old abe lincoln has been killed murdered and seward wounded why by whom it is simply maddening all this i sent off messenger after messenger for general chesnut i have not the faintest idea where he is but i know this foul murder will bring upon us worse miseries mary darby says but they murdered him themselves no confederates are in washington but if they see fit to accuse us of * it who murdered him who knows see if they dont take vengeance on us now that we are ruined and can not repel them any longer the death of lincoln i call a warning to tyrants he will not be the last president put to death in the capital though he is the first buck never * to be bored the * came to tea at mrs * and then sat and talked so * so wearisome was the discourse so endless it seemed that we envied buck who was * on the piazza she rarely speaks now my silver weddingday and i am sure the * day of my life mr portman came with christopher hampton portman told of miss kate hampton who is perhaps the most thoroughly ladylike person in the world when he told her that lee had surrendered she started up from her seat and said that is a lie well miss hampton i tell the tale as it was told me i can do no more no wonder john chesnut is bitter they say mulberry has been destroyed by a corps commanded by general * some one asked coolly will general chesnut be shot as a soldier or hung as a senator i am not of sufficient consequence answered he they will stop short of brigadiers i resigned my seat in the united states senate weeks before there was any secession so i can not be hung as a senator but after all it is only a choice between * court martial short * and a lingering death at home from starvation these negroes are unchanged the shining black mask they wear does not show a ripple of change they are sphinxes ellen has had my diamonds to keep for a week or so when the danger was over she handed them back to me with as little apparent interest in the matter as if they had been garden peas mrs huger was in church in richmond when the news of the surrender came worshipers were in the midst of the communion service mr mcfarland was called out to send away the gold from his bank mr * english grew confused then the president was summoned and distress of mind showed itself in every face the night before one of general lees aides walter taylor was married and was off to the wars immediately after the ceremony one year ago we left richmond the confederacy has * down hill since then one year since i stood in that beautiful hollywood by little joe daviss grave now we have burned towns deserted plantations sacked * you seem resolute to look the worst in the face said general chesnut wearily yes poverty with no future and no hope but no slaves thank god cried buck we would be the scorn of the world if the world thought of us at all you see we are exiles and paupers pile on the agony how does our famous captain the great lee bear the yankees galling chain i asked he knows how to possess his soul in patience answered my husband if there were no such word as subjugation no debts no poverty no negro mobs backed by yankees if all things were well you would shiver and feel benumbed he went on pointing at me in an * attitude your sentence is * for life in chester still i climb these steep steps alone they have all gone all passed by buck went with mr c hampton to york mary mrs huger and pinckney took flight together one day just before they began to dissolve in air captain gay was seated at the table halfway between me on the top step and john in the window with his legs outside said some one today she showed me her engagement ring and i put it back on her hand she is engaged but not to me by the heaven that is above us all i saw you kiss her hand that i deny captain gay glared in angry surprise and insisted that he had seen it sit down gay said the cool captain in his most mournful way you see my father died when i was a baby and my grandfather took me in hand to him i owe this moral maxim he is ninety years old a wise old man now remember my grandfathers teaching * gentleman must not kiss and tell general preston came to say goodby he will take his family abroad at once burnside in new orleans owes him some money and will pay it there will be no more confiscation my dear madam said he they must see that we have been punished enough they do not think so my dear general this very day a party of federals passed in hot pursuit of our president a terrible fireeater one of the few men left in the world who believe we have a right divine being white to hold africans who are black in bonds forever he is six feet two an athlete a splendid specimen of the animal man but he has never been under fire his place in the service was a bombproof office socalled with a face redhot with rage he denounced jeff davis and hood come now said edward the handsome men who could fight and did not they are the men who ruined us we wanted soldiers if the men who are cursing jeff davis now had fought with hood and fought as hood fought wed be all right now and then he told of my trouble one day while hood was here just such a fellow as you came up on this little platform and before mrs chesnut could warn him began to heap insults on jeff davis and his * hood mrs chesnut held up her hands stop not another word you shall not abuse my friends here not jeff davis behind his back not hood to his face for he is in that room and hears you fancy how * this creature was mrs huger told a story of joe johnston in his * days before he was famous after an illness johnstons hair all fell out not a hair was left on his head which shone like a fiery cannonball one of the gentlemen from africa who waited at table * so at dinner that he was ordered out by the grave and * black butler general huger feeling for the agonies of young africa as he strove to stifle his mirth suggested that joe johnston should cover his head with his handkerchief a red silk one was produced and * placed on his head that completely finished the gravity of the butler who fled in helplessness his * on the outside of the door became plainly audible general huger then suggested as they must have the waiter back or the dinner could not go on that joe should eat with his hat on which he did amden s c may 2 #* we left chester nothing but solitude nothing but tall blackened chimneys to show that any man has ever trod this road before this is shermans track it is hard not to curse him i wept incessantly at first the roses of the gardens are already hiding the ruins my husband said nature is a wonderful * he tried to say something else and then i shut my eyes and made a vow that if we were a crushed people crushed by weight i would never be a * pining slave we heard loud explosions of gunpowder in the direction of camden * were at it there met william walker whom mr preston left in charge of a * of his valuables general preston was hardly out of sight before poor helpless william had to stand by and see the car plundered my dear missis they have cleaned me out nothing left moaned william the faithful we have nine armed couriers with us can they protect us bade adieu to the staff at chester no general ever had so remarkable a staff so accomplished so agreeable so well bred and i must say so handsome and can add so brave and efficient home again at bloomsbury from chester to winnsboro we did not see one living thing man woman or animal except poor william * home after his sad disaster the blooming of the gardens had a funereal effect nature is so luxuriant here she soon covers the ravages of savages no frost has occurred since the seventh of march which accounts for the wonderful advance in vegetation this seems providential to these starving people in this climate so much that is * can be grown in two months at winnsboro we stayed at mr robertsons there we left the wagon train only mr * one of the generals couriers came with us on escort duty the robertsons were very kind and hospitable * of yankee anecdotes to my amazement the young people of winnsboro had a mayday celebration amid the smoking ruins irrepressible is youth the fidelity of the negroes is the principal topic there seems to be not a single case of a negro who betrayed his master and yet they showed a natural and exultant joy at being free after we left winnsboro negroes were seen in the fields * and * corn just as in antebellum times the fields in that respect looked quite cheerful we did not pass in the line of shermans savages and so saw some houses standing mary kirkland has had experience with the yankees she has been pronounced the most beautiful woman on this side of the atlantic and has been spoiled accordingly in all society when the yankees came monroe their negro * told her to stand up and hold two of her children in her arms with the other two pressed as close against her knees as they could get mammy * and lizzie then stood grimly on each side of their young missis and her children for four mortal hours the soldiers surged through the rooms of the house sometimes mary and her children were roughly jostled against the wall but mammy and lizzie were stanch supporters the yankee soldiers taunted the negro women for their * in standing by their cruel slaveowners and taunted mary with being glad of the protection of her poor illused slaves monroe meanwhile had one leg bandaged and pretended to be lame so that he might not be enlisted as a soldier and kept making pathetic appeals to mary dont answer them back miss mary said he let em say what dey want to dont answer em back dont give em any chance to say you are impudent to em one man said to her why do you shrink from us and avoid us so we did not come here to fight for negroes we hate them at port royal i saw a beautiful white woman driving in a wagon with a * negro man if she had been anything to me i would have shot her through the heart oh oh said lizzie thats the way you talk in here ill remember that when you begin outside to beg me to run away with you finally poor aunt betsy marys mother fainted from pure fright and exhaustion mary put down her baby and sprang to her mother who was lying limp in a chair and fiercely called out leave this room you wretches do you mean to kill my mother she is ill i must put her to bed without a word they all slunk out ashamed if i had only tried that hours ago she now said outside they remarked that she was an insolent rebel * who thinks herself too good to speak to a soldier of the united states and one of them said let us go in and break her mouth but the better ones held the more * back monroe slipped in again and said * for gods sake when dey come in be sociable with em dey will kill you then let me die the negro soldiers were far worse than the white ones mrs bartow drove with me to mulberry on one side of the house we found every window had been broken every bell torn down every piece of furniture destroyed and every door smashed in but the other side was intact maria whitaker and her mother who had been left in charge explained this odd state of things the yankees were busy as * working like regular carpenters destroying everything when their general came in and stopped them he told them it was a sin to destroy a fine old house like that whose owner was over ninety years old he would not have had it done for the world it was wanton mischief he explained to maria that soldiers at such times were excited wild and unruly they carried off sacks full of our books since unfortunately they found a pile of empty sacks in the garret our books our letters our papers were afterward strewn along the charleston road somebody found things of ours as far away as * ferry this was potters raid sherman took only our horses potters raid came after johnstons surrender and ruined us finally burning our mills and * and a hundred bales of cotton indeed nothing is left to us now but the bare land and the debts contracted for the support of hundreds of negroes during the war j h boykin was at home at the time to look after his own interests and he with john de saussure has saved the cotton on their estates with the mules and farming utensils and plenty of cotton as capital to begin on again the negroes would be a good * a hired man would be a good deal cheaper than a man whose father and mother wife and twelve children have to be fed clothed housed and nursed their taxes paid and their doctors bills all for his * * lazy work for years we have thought negroes a nuisance that did not pay they pretend exuberant loyalty to us now only one man of mr chesnuts left the plantation with the yankees when the yankees found the western troops were not at camden but down below swift creek like sensible folk they came up the other way and while we waited at chester for marching orders we were quickly ruined after the surrender with our cotton saved and cotton at a dollar a pound we might be in comparatively easy circumstances but now it is the devil to pay and no pitch hot well all this was to be * bailey editor whose prejudices are all against us described the raids to me in this wise they were regularly organized first came squads who demanded arms and whisky then came the rascals who hunted for silver ransacked the ladies * and scared women and children into * least those who could be scared some of these women could not be scared then came some smiling suave * officers who regretted it all so much outside the gate officers men and * divided even share and share alike the piles of plunder when we crossed the river coming home the ferry man at chesnuts ferry asked for his fee among us all we could not muster the small silver coin he demanded there was poverty for you nor did a * appear among us until molly was hauled home from columbia where she was waging war with sheriff dents family as soon as her foot touched her native heath she sent to hunt up the cattle many of our cows were found in the swamp like * men they had escaped the enemy molly sells butter for us now on shares old * head gardener at mulberry and yellow abram his assistant have gone on in the even tenor of their way men may come and men may go but they dig on forever and they say they mean to as long as old master is alive we have green peas asparagus * * new potatoes and strawberries in * for ourselves and plenty to give away to refugees it is early in may and yet two months since frost surely the wind was tempered to the shorn lamb in our case johnny went over to see hampton his cavalry are ordered to * on the #* little farce to let themselves down easily they know it is all over johnny smiling serenely said the thing is up and forever * bailey has presence of mind anne * left a gold * which was a terrible oversight among the cards on the drawingroom table when the yankee raiders saw it their eyes glistened * whispered to her let them have that gilt thing and slip away and hide the silver no shouted a * you dont fool me that way heres your old brass thing dont you stir fork over that silver and so they deposited the gold * in * hands and stole * spoons and forks which had been left out because they were * mrs beach says two officers slept at her house each had a pillowcase crammed with silver and * of war they called it * cantey heard an old negro say to his master when you all had de power you was good to me and ill protect you now no niggers nor yankees shall * you if you want anything call for * i mean call for mr samuel dat my name now a letter from a * who thanks the lord she is not as other women are she need not pray as the scotch parson did for a good conceit of herself she writes i feel that i will not be ruined come what may god will provide for me but her husband had strengthened the lords hands and for the glory of god doubtless invested some thousands of dollars in new york where confederate moth did not corrupt nor yankee * break through and steal she went on to tell us i have had the good things of this world and i have enjoyed them in their season but i only held them as steward for god my bread has been cast upon the waters and will return to me e m boykin said today we had a right to strike for our independence and we did strike a bitter blow they must be proud to have overcome such a foe i dare look any man in the face there is no humiliation in our position after such a struggle as we made for freedom from the yankees he is sanguine his main idea is joy that he has no negroes to support and need hire only those he really wants stephen elliott told us that sherman said to joe johnston look out for yourself this agreement only binds the military not the civil authorities is our destruction to begin anew for a few weeks we have had peace sally reynolds told a short story of a negro pet of mrs kershaws the little negro clung to mrs kershaw and begged her to save him the negro mother stronger than mrs kershaw tore him away from her mrs kershaw wept bitterly sally said she saw the mother chasing the child before her as she ran after the yankees whipping him at every step the child yelled like mad a small rebel * we are scattered and stunned the remnant of heart left alive within us filled with brotherly hate we sit and wait until the drunken tailor who rules the united states of america issues a proclamation and defines our anomalous position such a hue and cry but whose fault everybody is blamed by somebody else the dead heroes left stiff and stark on the battlefield escape blame every man who stayed at home and did not fight i will not stop to hear excuses there is not one word against those who stood out until the bitter end and stacked muskets at appomattox a feeling of sadness hovers over me now day and night which no words of mine can express there is a chance for plenty of character study in this mulberry house if one only had the heart for it colonel chesnut now * blind and deaf is apparently as strong as ever and certainly as resolute of will partly patriarch partly grand * this old man is of a species that we shall see no * last of a race of lordly planters who ruled this southern world but now a splendid wreck his manners are * still but underneath this smooth exterior lies the grip of a tyrant whose will has never been crossed i will not attempt what lord byron says he could not do but must quote again everybody knows a gentleman when he sees him i have never met a man who could describe one we have had three very distinct specimens of the * in this * generations of gentlemen each utterly different from the * son and grandson african scipio walks at colonel chesnuts side he is six feet two a black hercules and as gentle as a dove in all his dealings with the blind old master who boldly strides forward striking with his stick to feel where he is going the yankees left scipio unmolested he told them he was absolutely essential to his old master and they said if you want to stay so bad he must have been good to you always * says he was silent for it made them mad if you praised your master sometimes this old man will stop himself just as he is going off in a fury because they try to prevent his attempting some feat impossible in his condition of lost faculties he will ask gently i hope that i never say or do anything unseemly sometimes i think i am subject to mental * at every * he calls out who goes there if a ladys name is given he * and stands with hat off until she passes he still has the oldworld art of bowing low and gracefully colonel chesnut came of a race that would brook no interference with their own sweet will by man woman or devil but then such manners has he they would clear any mans character if it needed it mrs chesnut his wife used to tell us that when she met him at princeton in the * of the eighteenth century they called him the young prince he and mr john taylor of columbia were the first * youths whose parents were wealthy enough to send them off to college when a college was established in south carolina colonel john chesnut the father of the aforesaid young prince was on the first board of trustees indeed i may say that since the revolution of 1776 there has been no * of the * of south carolina in times of peace and prosperity or of war and adversity in which a representative man of this family has not appeared the estate has been kept together until now mrs chesnut said she drove down from philadelphia on her bridal trip in a chariot and * * chariot with * they have a saying * account of the large families with which people are usually

fact that they have it on their coatofarms our johnny as he was driving me down to mulberry yesterday declared himself delighted with the fact that the present joseph kershaw had so distinguished himself in our war that they might let the shop of a hundred years ago rest for a while upon my soul cried the cool captain i have a desire to go in there and look at the kershaw tombstones i am sure they have put it on their marble tablets that we had an ancestor one day a hundred years ago who was a clerk in their shop this clerk became a captain in the revolution in the second generation the shop had so far sunk that the john chesnut of that day refused to let his daughter marry a handsome dissipated kershaw and she a spoiled beauty who could not endure to obey orders when they were disagreeable to her went up to her room and therein remained never once coming out of it for forty years her father let her have her own way in that he provided servants to wait upon her and every

she was free but i do not see one particle of change in their manner they are perhaps more circumspect polite and quiet but that is all otherwise all goes on in antebellum * quo every day i expect to miss some familiar face but so far have been disappointed mrs huger we found at the hotel here and we brought her to bloomsbury she told us that jeff davis was traveling leisurely with his wife twelve miles a day utterly careless whether he were taken prisoner or not and that general hampton had been paroled fighting dick anderson and stephen elliott of fort sumter memory are quite ready to pray for andy johnson and to submit to the powers that be not so our belligerent clergy pray for people when i wish they were dead cries rev mr trapier no never i will pray for president davis till i die i will do it to my last gasp my chief is a prisoner but i am proud of him still he is a spectacle to gods and men he will bear himself as a soldier a patriot a statesman a christian gentleman he is the

left on this earth if he does not die game i give it up something you see was due to lincoln and the scotch cap that he hid his ugly face with in that express car when he rushed through baltimore in

the loan of money which would have been almost the same as a gift so slim was our chance of * it but it was a generous thought on her part i own that went to our plantation the hermitage yesterday saw no change not a soul was absent from his or her post i said good colored folks when are you going to kick off the traces and be free in their furious emotional way they swore devotion to us all to

their professions to us but declare that they are to be paid by these blessed yankees in lands and mules for having been slaves they were so faithful to us during the war why should the yankees reward

why should milly never have * her condition my grandmother lent a helping hand to her grandmother my mother did her best for her mother and i am sure the socalled witch could never complain of me as long as i can remember * of these sandhill women * in with baskets to be filled by charity ready to carry away anything they could get all are made on the same pattern more or less alike they were treated as friends and neighbors not as beggars they were asked in to take seats by the fire and there they sat for hours * silent wearing out human endurance and politeness but their husbands and

after hearing these tales the fidelity of my own servants shines out brilliantly i had taken their conduct too much as a matter of course in the afternoon i had some business on our place the hermitage john drove me down our people were all at home quiet orderly respectful and at their usual work in point of fact things looked unchanged there was nothing to show that any one of them had even seen the yankees or knew that there was one in existence i do not write often now not for want of something to say but from a loathing of all i see and hear and why dwell upon those things colonel chesnut poor old man is * more restless he seems to be wild with * he wants to be at mulberry when there he can not see the mighty giants of the forest the huge old * oaks but he says he feels
