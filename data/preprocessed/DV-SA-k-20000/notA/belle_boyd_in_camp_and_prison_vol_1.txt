birthplace loved to the last whatever * between us and our childhoods sympathy which still * to what first caught the eye there is perhaps no tract of country in the world more lovely than the valley of the shenandoah there is or rather i should say there was no prettier or more peaceful little village than martinsburg where i was born in 1844 all those charms with which the fancy of * invested the irish hamlet in the days of its prosperity were realized in my native village alas martinsburg has met a more cruel fate than that of sweet auburn the one at least still lives in song and will continue to be a household word as long as the english language shall be spoken the other was destined to be the first and fairest offering upon the altar of confederate freedom but no poet has arisen from her ruins to perpetuate her name while america was yet at peace within itself while the states were yet united many very beautiful residences were erected in the vicinity of martinsburg which may be said to have attained some degree of importance as a town when the large machinery buildings were raised at a vast * by the baltimore and ohio railway company they were not destined to repay those who designed them while they were yet in course of construction their doom was silently but rapidly approaching they were destroyed as the only means of averting their capture by the advancing yankees

pretty twostoried house the walls of which are completely hidden by roses and honeysuckle in most luxuriant bloom at a short distance in front of it flows a broad clear rapid stream around it the silver maples wave their graceful branches in the * air of the south even at this distance of time and space as i write in my dull london lodging i can hardly restrain my tears when i recall the sweet scene of my early days such as it was before the unsparing hand of a ruthless enemy had defaced its loveliness i frequently indulge in a fond soliloquy and say or rather think do my english readers ever bestow a thought upon that cruel fate which has overtaken so many of their * descendants whose only crime has been that love of freedom which the pilgrim fathers could not leave behind them when they left their island home do they bestow any pity any sympathy upon us homeless ruined exiled confederates do they ever pause to reflect what would be their own feelings if far and wide throughout their country the ancestral hall the farmers homestead and the * cot were giving shelter to the * soldiers of an invader or crackling in incendiary flames with what emotions would the citizens of london watch the campfires of a * army say with what eye along the distant down would flying * mark the blazing town how view the column of ascending flames shake his red shadow oer the startled thames much has lately been written of the comfort of our southern homesteads and now though so many of them are things of the past while those that remain are no longer what they were i may safely say that not even english homes were more comfortable in the true sense of the word than ours while for hospitality we have never been surpassed i passed my childhood as all happy children usually do petted and caressed by a father and mother loving and beloved by my brothers and sisters the peculiarly sad circumstances that attended my fathers death will be found recorded at a future page where my mother is hiding her head i know not doubtless she is equally ignorant of my fate my brothers and sisters are dispersed god knows where but to return to my narrative i believe i shall not be contradicted in * that nowhere could be found more pleasant society than that of virginia in this respect the neighbourhood of martinsburg was remarkably fortunate * as it was by some of the best and most respectable families of the old dominion respectable i mean both in reputation and in point of antiquity descendants of such ancestors as the fairfaxes and * upon whom mr thackeray has lately conferred immortality according to the custom of my country i was sent at twelve years of age to mount washington college of which mr * of whom i cherish a most grateful recollection was then principal at sixteen my education was supposed to be completed and i made my entre into the world in washington city with all the high hopes and thoughtless joy natural to my time of life i did not then dream how soon my youth was to be blasted with a curse the worst that can befall man or woman the curse of civil war washington is so well known to english people that i need not pause to describe the city its * and pleasures in the winter of # when i made my first acquaintance with it the season was * brilliant the senate and congress halls were nightly dignified by the presence of our ablest orators and statesmen the * of the wealthy and the talented were filled to overflowing the * were crowded to excess and for the last time for many years to come the daughters of the north and the south commingled in * love and friendship i am inclined to think that at the time of which i speak the city of washington must have very nearly resembled that of paris during those few years which immediately preceded 1789 while the elements of a stupendous revolution were yet hidden beneath a tranquil and * surface like the * of that memorable epoch we were wilfully or fatally blind to the signs of the times we ate and drank we dined and danced we went in and came out we married and were given in marriage without a thought of the volcano that was seething beneath our feet who can predict what will be the end and issue of our revolution when we consider that the effects of that which burst forth seventyfive years ago wrapped all europe in flames and hurled kings from their thrones are even now but partially developed how many thousands of our sons have fallen in battle against oppressors who would not confess that our freedom was beyond their power how many hapless women and children have perished * or been driven forth to beg their bread in foreign countries before enemies who with heavy hands have sought to * our chains enemies who could not discern the truth of the irish orators memorable axiom and acknowledge that the genius of liberty is universal and irresistible political contest commencement of the great struggle in america secession of the southern states we hear of the fall of fort sumter call for troops the stars and bars volunteers enlistment of my father patriotism of the southern women harpers ferry visit to camp * balls c c the * of washington to which i alluded in my first chapter were soon * by the clouds that gathered in the political horizon the contest for the * was over and the men of the south could no longer hide it from themselves that the issue of the struggle must determine their fate the secession of the southern states individually or in the aggregate was the certain consequence of mr lincolns election his accession to a power supreme and almost unparalleled was an unequivocal declaration by the merchants of new england that they had resolved to exclude the landed proprietors of the south from all participation in the legislation of their common country i will not attempt to defend the institution of slavery the very name of which is abhorred in england but it will be admitted that the emancipation of the negro was not the object of northern ambition that is of the faction which * exclusive power in contempt of general rights slavery like all other imperfect forms of society will have its day but the time for its final extinction in the confederate states of america has not yet arrived can it be urged that a race which prefers servitude to freedom has reached that * period of existence which fits it for the latter condition meanwhile which stands in the better position the * of the south or the free negro of the north the willing slave of a confederate master or the reluctant victim of federal conscription and here i must take leave to ask a question of two great authors both formerly advocates of an instantaneous abolition of slavery is the ghost of uncle tom laid has the slave dreamed his last dream will mrs h b stowe and mr * admit that in either instance the hero owes his reputation for martyrdom to a creative genius and to an exquisite fancy or will they still contend that the negro slave of the confederate states is physically and morally a real object of commiseration the first champion of freedom i speak advisedly and in defiance of a seeming * was south carolina she was a slaveholding state but she flung down the gauntlet in the name and for the cause of liberty her bold example was soon followed state after state seceded and the union was dissolved it was now that we heard of the fall of fort sumter and mr lincolns demand upon the state of virginia he called upon her to furnish her quota of # recruits to engage in battle with her sister states he sowed the dragons teeth and he soon reaped the only harvest that could spring from such seed virginia promptly answered to the call and produced the required soldiers but they did not rally under the stars and stripes it was to the stars and bars the emblem of the south that mr lincolns virginian soldiers tendered the oath of military allegiance the flag of the once loved but now * union was lowered and the colours of the confederacy were raised in its place since that memorable epoch those colours have been baptized with the blood of thousands to whose death in a cause so righteous the honour and reverence that wait upon martyrdom have been justly awarded oh if there be in this earthly sphere a boon an offering heaven holds dear it is the * that liberty draws from the heart that bleeds and breaks in her cause the enthusiasm of the enlistment was adequate to the occasion old men with gray hairs and stooping forms young boys just able to shoulder a musket strong and weak rich and poor rallied round our new standard actuated by a stern sense of duty and eager for death or victory it was at this exciting crisis that i returned to martinsburg and oh what a striking contrast my native village presented to the scenes i had just left behind me at washington my winter had been cheered by every kind of amusement and every form of pleasure my summer was about to be darkened by constant anxiety and heartrending affliction my father was one of the first to volunteer he was offered that grade in the army to which his social position entitled him but like many of our virginian gentlemen he preferred to enlist in the ranks thereby leaving the pay and emoluments of an officers commission to some other whose means were not so ample and whose family might be * in his absence from home an absence that must of course interfere with his * or profession the 2nd virginian was the regiment to which my father attached himself it was armed and equipped by means of a subscription raised by myself and other ladies of the valley on the colours were inscribed these words so full of pathos and inspiration our god our country and our women the corps was commanded by colonel * and belonged to that section of the southern army afterwards known as the stonewall brigade the stonewall brigade the very name now bears with it traditions of surpassing glory and i seize this opportunity of assuring english readers that it is with pride we confederates acknowledge that our heroes caught their inspiration from the example of their english ancestors when our descendants shall read the story of general jackson and his men they will be insensibly attracted to those earlier pages of history which record the exploits of * light division my fathers regiment was hardly formed when it was ordered to harpers ferry for the sacred soil of virginia was threatened with invasion and it was thought possible to make a stand at this lovely spot to see which is worth a voyage across the atlantic at the outbreak of the war harpers ferry could boast of one of the largest and best arsenals in america and of a magnificent bridge which latter * the broad stream of the potomac connected maryland with virginia both arsenal and bridge were blown up in july 1861 by the confederate forces when the federals pressing upon them in overwhelming numbers compelled a retreat my home had now become desolate and lonely the excitement caused by our exertions to * our father for the field had ceased and the reaction of feeling had set in a general sadness and depression prevailed throughout our household my mothers face began to wear an anxious careworn expression our nights were not passed in sleep but in thinking painfully of the loved one who was exposed to the dangers and privations of war my mother the daughter of an old officer was left an orphan when very young she had married my father just as she entered upon her sixteenth year and now almost for the first time they were parted under circumstances which made the separation bitter indeed for myself i endeavoured to while away the long hours of those * days by the aid of my books and in making up different kinds of * provisions for the use of my father to whom i knew they would in his novel position be a luxury but notwithstanding all the restrictions i laid upon myself and all the selfcontrol i endeavoured to exert i soon found these * too tame and monotonous to satisfy my temperament and i made up my mind to pay a visit to the camp * qui * i had no difficulty in prevailing upon some of my friends to accompany me in an expedition to headquarters like myself they had friends and relations to whom they felt their occasional presence would be a source of encouragement and solace and we all knew that such a goodly company as we formed could return safely to martinsburg at almost any hour of the day or night the camp at harpers ferry was at this time an animated scene officers and men were as gay and joyous as though no bloody strife awaited them the ladies married and single in the society of husbands brothers sons and lovers cast their cares to the winds and seemed one and all resolved that whatever calamity the future might have in store for them it should not mar the transient pleasures of the hour since then i have had occasion to observe that such a state of feeling is not unnatural or unusual in the minds of men standing as it were on the brink of a precipice or walking as it were over the surface of a mine perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures and the payment is doubly sweet when it is taken in anticipation of the debt i fear that at this time many fond vows were exchanged and many true hearts pledged between the girls of the neighbourhood and the occupants of the camp but it may be pardoned to beauty and innocence if they are not insensible to the virtues of courage and patriotism a true woman always loves a real soldier in the earliest ages poets and philosophers foretold that the goddess of love and beauty would ever move in the same * and in close conjunction with the god of battles and the experience of ages has confirmed the judgment of antiquity alas the loves of harpers ferry were in but too many instances buried in a bloody grave the soldier who plighted his faith to his * was not tried in a long probation but * by an early death war will exact its victims of both sexes and claims the hearts of women no less than the bodies of men to return from this digression our * was not of long duration the advance of a federal army was reported and general jackson with a force amounting to 5000 men marched out to reconnoitre and if possible to check their aggressive movement our people encamped at falling waters a romantic spot eight miles from martinsburg and four from williamsport for at this point of the river it was * the yankees had resolved to force a passage it was early in the morning of the 3rd july that we * folks of dear martinsburg were startled by the roar of artillery and the rattle of musketry and the intelligence was presently circulated that the yankees were advancing upon us in force under the command of generals patterson and * it turned out however that at the moment of which i speak their advanced guard only was in motion but the skirmish between our people and the enemy was sustained during nearly five hours on both sides some fell and besides the casualties of the federals in killed and wounded we took about fifty of them prisoners about ten oclock general jacksons army in admirable array marched through martinsburg they were in full retreat their object being to effect a junction with the main body under general j e johnston who had evacuated harpers ferry and was falling back by way of charlestown upon winchester jacksons retreat was covered by a few horsemen under the gallant colonel ashby and scarcely were these latter disengaged from the streets of the town when the shrill notes of the fife and the roll of the drum announced the approach of a federal army which proved to be 25000 strong it was to us a sad but an imposing sight on they came their colours streaming to the breeze their bayonets glittering in the sunlight with all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war we could see from afar the dancing plumes of the cavalry the glittering files oer whose gay trappings stern * smiles we could before long hear the rumbling of the guncarriages and worse than this the * shouts with which the infuriated and undisciplined soldiers poured into the town at the time of their entry i was in the hospital with my negro maid and some ladies of my acquaintance in attendance upon two of our southern soldiers who had been stricken down with fever and were lying side by side these were the sole tenants of the hospital all the others had been borne off by the retreating army i was standing close by the side of one of these poor men who was just then * in a violent fit of delirium when i was startled by the sound of heavy footsteps behind me and turning round i confronted a captain of federal infantry accompanied by two private soldiers he held in his hand a federal flag which he proceeded to wave over the bed of the sick men at the same time calling them rebels i immediately said with all the scorn i could convey into my looks sir these men are as helpless as babies and have as you may see no power to reply to your insults and pray said he who may you be miss i did not deign to reply but my negro maid answered him a rebel lady hereupon he turned upon his heel and retired with the courteous remark that i was a independent one at all events i hope my readers will pardon my quoting his exact words without such strict accuracy i should fail to do justice to his gallantry notwithstanding this interruption to our womans mission the ladies to whom i have before alluded and myself were not discouraged and before long we contrived to get our patients moved to more comfortable quarters they were taken away on * and while they were in this defenseless condition a condition which would have awakened the sympathy and secured the protection of a brave enemy the federal soldiers crowded round and threatened to bayonet them their * and language grew so violent their countenances inflamed by drink and hatred were so frightful that i nerved myself to seek out an officer and appeal to his sense of military honour even if the voice of mercy were silent in his breast let me do him the justice to say he restrained his turbulent men from further molestation and i had the unspeakable satisfaction of conveying my sick men to a place of safety the satisfaction was immeasurable for i never for one moment forgot that insults such as i had just seen offered to defenceless men might at any moment be heaped upon my own father fourth of july the yankee flag is hoisted in martinsburg great excitement my first adventure an article of war is read to me miss sophia bs walk the morning of the 4th of july dawned brightly i need hardly say for it is well known that the anniversary of the declaration of independence has in each succeeding year from that of its birth been hailed with triumphant * by a nation still too young to moderate its transports and lend its ear to the voice of reason rather than to the impulse of passion the yankees were in undisputed possession of martinsburg the village was at their mercy and consequently entitled to their forbearance and it would at least have been more dignified in them had they been content to enjoy their almost bloodless conquest with moderation but whatever might have been the intentions of the officers they had not the inclination or they lacked the authority to control the turbulence of their men the severance of the north from the south had now become in feeling so complete that we martinsburg girls saw the union flag streaming from the windows of the houses with emotions akin to those with which the ladies of england would gaze upon the * of france or the eagle of russia floating above the keep of * castle those hateful strains of yankee doodle resounded in every street with an accompaniment of cheers shouts and imprecations whisky now began to flow freely for amid the motley crowd of americans * and other nations the irish element * the sprigs of * were soon at work and the sons of erin proved that they could use their sticks with no less effect in an american town than at an irish fair they set at defiance the authority of those among their officers who vainly interposed to * the tumult and restrain the lawless violence that was offered to defenceless citizens and women the doors of our houses were dashed in our rooms were forcibly entered by soldiers who might literally be termed mad drunk for i can think of no other expression so applicable to their condition glass and fragile property of all kinds was wantonly destroyed they found our homes scenes of comfort in some cases even of luxury they left them mere wrecks utterly despoiled and mutilated shots were fired through the windows chairs and tables were hurled into the street in some instances a trembling lady would make a timid appeal to that honour which should be the attribute of every soldier or with streaming eyes and passionate accents plead for some cherished object the portrait probably of a dead father or the miniature her lover placed in her hand when he left her to fight for his freedom and hers upon which many a secret kiss had been pressed many a silent tear had fallen before which many an earnest prayer had been breathed to such supplications the reply was invariably a volley of blasphemous curses and horrid imprecations words from which the mind * with horror which no man with one spark of feeling would utter in the presence even of the most abandoned woman were shouted in the ears of innocent shrinking girls and the soldiers of the union showed a malignant a * delight in destroying the * of enemies whom they had not yet dared to meet upon equal terms in an open field of battle surely it is not strange that * such as i have attempted to describe have exasperated our women no less than our men and inspired them with sterner feelings than those which inflame the bosoms of ladies who know nothing of invasion but its name who have never at their own firesides shuddered at the oaths and threats of a robber disguised in the garb of a soldier shall i be ashamed to confess that i recall without one shadow of remorse the act by which i saved my mother from insult perhaps from death that the blood i then shed has left no stain on my soul imposed no burden upon my conscience the encounter to which i refer was brought about as follows a party of soldiers conspicuous even on that day for violence broke into our house and commenced their depredations this occupation however they presently discontinued for the purpose of hunting for rebel flags with which they had been informed my room was decorated fortunately for us although without my orders my negro maid promptly rushed upstairs tore down the obnoxious emblem and before our enemies could get possession of it burned it they had brought with them a large federal flag which they were now preparing to * over our roof in token of our submission to their authority but to this my mother would not consent stepping forward with a firm step she said very quietly but resolutely men every member of my household will die before that flag shall be raised over us upon this one of the soldiers thrusting himself forward addressed my mother and myself in language as offensive as it is possible to conceive i could stand it no longer my indignation was roused beyond control my blood was literally boiling in my veins i drew out my pistol and shot him he was carried away mortally wounded and soon after expired our persecutors now left the house and we were in hopes we had got rid of them when one of the servants rushing in cried out oh misses missus * gwine to burn de house down * * de stuff agin it oh if massa were back the prospect of being burned alive naturally terrified us and as a last resource i contrived to get a message conveyed to the federal officer in command he exerted himself with effect and had the * arrested before they could execute their horrible purpose in the meantime it had been reported at headquarters that i had shot a yankee soldier and great was the indignation at first felt and expressed against me soon however the commanding officer with several of his staff called at our house to investigate the affair he examined the witnesses and inquired into all the circumstances with strict impartiality and finally said i had done perfectly right he immediately sent for a guard to headquarters where the lite of the army was stationed and a tolerable state of discipline preserved sentries were now placed around the house and federal officers called every day to inquire if we had any complaint to make of their behaviour it was in this way that i became acquainted with so many of them an acquaintance the rebel spy did not fail to turn to account on more than one occasion when the news reached the confederate camp at * seven miles from martinsburg on the valley road that i had shot a yankee soldier in selfdefence together with the false report that for so doing i had been thrown into the town gaol the soldiers with one accord volunteered to storm the prison and rescue me or die to a man in the attempt it is with pride and gratitude that i record this proof of their esteem and respect for what i had done it is with no less pleasure i reflect that their devotion was not put to the test and that no blood was shed on my account and now for seven consecutive days general * johnston sent in a flag of truce offering battle to general patterson this challenge patterson persistently declined i am not so ignorant of warfare as not to know that strategic reasons justify the most daring general in refusing battle whenever and wherever he pleases if thou art a great soldier come and fight if thou art a great soldier make me come and fight but though the federal commander had a perfect right to choose his own battlefield he had in my opinion no right to couple his refusal of the challenge with a threat that as soon as johnston should think fit to make an aggressive movement he would at once shell martinsburg which sheltered the noncombatants the women and the children the sick and the infirm meanwhile my residence within the federal lines and my acquaintance with so many of the officers the origin of which i have already mentioned enabled me to gain much important information as to the position and designs of the enemy whatever i heard i regularly and carefully committed to paper and whenever an opportunity offered i sent my secret despatch by a trusty messenger to general j e b stuart or some brave officer in command of the confederate troops through accident or by treachery one of these * fell into the yankees hands it was not written in cipher and moreover my handwriting was identified i was immediately summoned to appear before some colonel whose name i have forgotten but i remember it was captain * who escorted me to headquarters there i was alternately threatened and reprimanded and finally the following article of war was read to me in a most emphatic manner and with the caution that it would be carried out in the spirit and the letter whoever shall give food ammunition information to or aid and * the enemies of the united states government in any manner whatever shall suffer death or whatever penalty the honourable members of the courtmartial shall see fit to inflict i was not frightened for i felt within me the spirit of the douglas from whom i am descended i listened quietly to the recital of the doom which was to be my reward for adhering to the traditions of my youth and the cause of my country made a low bow and with a sarcastic thank you gentlemen of the jury i departed not in peace however for my little rebel heart was on fire and i indulged in thoughts and plans of vengeance from this hour i was a suspect and all the mischief done to the federal cause was laid to my charge and it is with unfeigned joy and true pride i confess that the suspicions of the enemy were far from being unfounded on one occasion a friend of mine miss sophia b of martinsburg a lovely girl slipped away with a * de cachet walked seven miles to the camp of stonewall jackson and handed him important information which was productive of much good she like myself had brothers enrolled in that band of heroes battle of manassas establishment of a hospital at front royal virginia a runaway excursion capture of federal officers throughout the north the utmost confidence was felt that the subjugation of the rebels would be rapid and complete ninety days on on to richmond was the cry but the shout was changed to a wail on manassas plains where the first great battle of the war was fought the action was precipitated by pattersons attempt to prevent johnston from erecting a junction with beauregard at manassas in this he failed and the result of the movements and * was the battle of bull run this great confederate victory has become an historical fact i shall therefore pass it by in silence and proceed to the narrative of my own personal adventures at the time in question i was at front royal virginia on a visit to my uncle and aunt mr and mrs s i wish it were in my power to give my readers some faint idea of this picturesque village which nestles in the bosom of the surrounding mountains and reminds one of a young bird in its nest a * which sometimes * round the obstacles to its course sometimes bounds over them with headlong leap at last finds its way to the valley beneath and glides by the village in peace and beauty the scene is far beyond my powers of description it is worthy of the pencil of * rosa or the pen of the author of gertrude of * and i only wish the great * had been given to our age and had wandered to the hills and valleys of virginia to this romantic retreat my uncle and aunt had fled as deer fly for safety to the hills they had resided in washington but their southern sympathies were too strong and too openly expressed to allow of their remaining unmolested in the northern capital they left a magnificent house replete with handsome furniture a prey to the yankees who converted it into barracks orders now came from the battlefield of bull run to the effect that the general in command had fixed upon front royal for the site of an extensive hospital for the wounded confederate soldiers every one in the village and the neighbourhood showed the greatest alacrity i should say enthusiasm in preparing in the shortest possible time all that our suffering heroes could require i bore my part and before long was duly installed one of the matrons my office was a very laborious one and my duties were painful in the extreme but then as always i allowed but one thought to keep possession of my mind the thought that i was doing all a woman could do in her countrys cause the motto of my fathers regiment was * on my heart and i trust that i have always shown by my actions that i understood its significance after six or eight weeks spent in incessant nursing i was forced to return to my home at martinsburg in order to recruit my health which had suffered severely and i leave my readers to imagine with what joy i heard my dear mothers praises of actions which she in her fond affection styled heroic in october my mother and myself resolved upon a short visit to my father at manassas we stayed at a large house situated in the very centre of the camp this tenement was then the temporary abode of several other ladies wives and daughters of officers during this period i had frequently the honour of acting the part of courier between general beauregard general jackson and their subordinates this was a happy time but it did not last long and after a few weeks spent as above described my mother and i returned to martinsburg the winter passed very quietly and brought me but a single adventure worth recording i was riding out one evening with two young officers one a cousin and the other a friend when my horse a young and highspirited creature took fright and ran away with me notwithstanding all my efforts i failed to stop him until he had carried me within the federal lines a goal to which my companions could not venture to follow me i felt rather uncomfortable not knowing exactly how to act but i soon made up my mind that for this once at all events valour would be the better part of discretion if not prudence itself so riding straight up to the officer in command of the picket i said i beg your pardon you must know that i have been taking a ride with some of my friends my horse ran away with me and has carried me within your lines i am your captive but i beg you will permit me to return we are exceedingly proud of our beautiful captive replied one of the officers with a bow but of course we cannot think of detaining you then after a moments pause he added may we have the honour of escorting you beyond our lines and restoring you to the custody of your friends i suppose there is no fear of those cowardly rebels taking us prisoners i had scarcely hoped i replied for such an honour i thought you would probably have given me a pass but since you are so kind as to offer your services in person i cannot do otherwise than accept them have no fear gentlemen of the cowardly rebels they little thought how those words cowardly rebels rankled in my heart off we started and imagine their blank looks when soon after they had escorted me beyond their lines my confederate friends who had been anxiously waiting for me rode out from their ambush and joined the party all four looked surprised and embarrassed i broke the general silence by saying with a laugh to the confederates here are two prisoners that i have brought you then turning to the federal officers i said here are two of the cowardly rebels whom you hoped there was no danger of meeting they looked * and inquiringly at me and after a short pause exclaimed almost simultaneously and who pray is the lady belle boyd at your service i replied good god the rebel spy so be it since your journals have honoured me with that title after this short colloquy we escorted them without any attempt at resistance on their part to headquarters and related all the circumstances of the adventure to the officer in command who ordered them to be detained the yankees reproached us bitterly with our treachery but when it is considered that their release followed their capture within an hour that they had in the first instance stigmatized the rebels when none were near as cowards that they had immediately afterwards yielded without a blow to an equal number of these * cowards i think my readers will admit their spirit of * well merited a slight humiliation let us hope they have profited by the lesson i consoled myself that all was fair in love and war although bull run had been fought and i had witnessed the outrages of july 4th at martinsburg we had hardly yet realized the horrors of war or to speak more correctly we did not allow ourselves to believe in their continuance we hoped that enough had been done to pave the way for reconciliation winter set in and closed the campaign and with a cessation of active hostilities our apprehensions for the future were forgotten in our enjoyment of the present it was only when spring returned and brought with it no sign of a dove from the ark that we realized how far the waters of the deluge were from * balls and * mirth and laughter vanished with the last snows of winter and it was with sad and sickening hearts we saw colonel ashby and his cavalry evacuate the town but a very few years since henry afterwards colonel ashby was one of those young men whose characters have been so often imagined by writers of romance but are so rarely met with in real life he united in himself all those qualifications which justly recommend their possessor to the love of the one sex and to the esteem of the other at once tender and respectful manly and accomplished animated and handsome he won without an effort the hearts of women brave and * he combined simplicity with talents of the highest order he entertained a strict sense of honour and never forgot what was due to himself and he was ever wont to forget an injury and even to pardon an insult upon the first overture of the offender endowed with such qualities it is not surprising he was a universal favourite and indeed it was commonly said the spirit of admirable * had * the world in the person of henry ashby such a man was sure to be among the first to draw his sword in the cause of independence at an early period of the war he was appointed to the command of a regiment of cavalry in which capacity he displays an unusual degree of vigilance and alacrity in the arduous service of outpost duty on one occasion his regiment was drawn up at some distance from a railroad which passed directly across his front on the farther side was broken ground well calculated to conceal a large body of men colonel ashby therefore ordered out a small party to reconnoitre putting them under command of his younger brother between whom and himself there subsisted an affection warm genuine almost romantic unfortunately dick ashbys impetuosity * his judgment and exceeding the instructions he had received from his brother he passed some distance beyond the railway and suddenly found himself in presence of a large body of the enemy he retreated in admirable order but the yankees pressed hard upon him and he and his little band were overtaken upon the railroad here a fatal accident befell poor dick ashby his horse stumbled and fell at one of the cuts in this defenseless condition he was set upon without mercy without even quarter being offered by five yankees at once in spite of these odds and the disadvantage at which he was taken he sold his life so dearly that his five assailants were all killed or wounded by this time colonel ashby leading on his regiment at a gallop had reached the scene of action and the contest being now pretty equal the federals soon fled and were pursued as far as the nature of the ground would permit the victors then returned to the railway and hastily dug a shallow grave into which all that remained of dick ashby was consigned colonel ashby dismounted and kneeling by the mutilated body gently disengaged the sword from his dead brothers hand then breaking it into pieces he cast them into the grave and on that solemn spot vowed to avenge his brothers murder and to consecrate the remainder of his life to the service of his country this vow he faithfully kept his character underwent a change as instantaneous and enduring as that of colonel gardiner all his gaiety and high spirits forsook him in society he was rarely heard to speak never seen to smile and after a brief but glorious career he fell in an unequal and desperate struggle cheering on his men with his dying breath the bravest are the tenderest the gentle are the daring i shall conclude this chapter with another short episode which proves how suddenly national * discover the hidden force of individual character miss d at the outbreak of the war was a lovely * girl of nineteen remarkable for the sweetness of her temper and the gentleness of her disposition a few days before the battle of bull run a country * stopped in the confederate lines at the door of general bonhams tent a * * from the cart and begged for an immediate interview with the general it was granted general bonham i believe said the young lady in tones which betrayed her superiority to the disguise she had assumed then tearing down her long black hair she took from its folds a note small damp and crumpled but it was by acting upon this informal despatch that general beauregard won the victory of bull run miss d had passed through the whole of the federal army i dare not now publish her name but if ever these pages meet her eye she will not fail to recognize her own portrait nor will she be displeased to find that her exiled * * the remembrance of her intrepidity and devotion advance of the federal army i leave home with my father battle of * i am arrested and carried prisoner to baltimore released and sent to martinsburg i attempt to go south to richmond shields army at front royal incidents c c with the first genial days of spring the federal troops broke up their winter quarters and advanced again upon the devastated village of martinsburg which had been held during the winter by the confederates martinsburg situated as it was on the border of the state was incessantly a bone of contention and its capture and recapture were of frequent recurrence my father who had been at home on * for several weeks was now able to resume his military duties and he decided upon removing me farther south as our home was in constant peril and i had gained a notoriety which would hardly recommend me to the favourable notice of the federals in the event of their shortly reoccupying martinsburg which seemed only too probable accordingly i was again sent to front royal there to remain until our home should once more be secure a few days after my arrival at front royal a battle was fought close by at * the confederates vastly * in numbers were forced to retreat and front royal became the prize of the conquerors thus to use a homely adage out of the * into the fire had been my fate upon the approach of the enemy my uncle and aunt taking with them one daughter quitted home with the intention of reaching richmond leaving their other daughter alice s a beautiful girl about my own age our grandmamma mrs * and myself to take charge of the house and servants and act in all contingencies to the best of our ability when i found that the confederate forces were retreating so far down the valley and reflected that my father was with them i became very anxious to return to my mother and as no tie of duty bound me to front royal i resolved upon the attempt at all hazards i started in company with my maid and had got safely without adventure of any kind as far as winchester when some unknown enemy or some malicious neutral denounced me to the authorities as a confederate spy before however this act of hostility or malice had been perpetrated i had taken the precaution of procuring a pass from general shields and i fondly hoped that this would under all circumstances secure me from molestation and arrest for i was not aware that while i was in the very act of receiving my bill of moral health an order was being issued by the provostmarshal which forbade me to leave the town when the hour which i had fixed for my departure arrived i stepped into the railway cars and was congratulating myself with the thought that i should ere long be at home once more and in the society of those i loved when a federal officer captain * appeared he was in charge of some confederate prisoners who under his command were en route to the baltimore prison i was more surprised than pleased when handing over the prisoners to a subordinate he walked straight up to me and said is this miss belle boyd yes i am the * and i regret to say orders have been issued for your detention and it is my duty to inform you that you cannot proceed until your case has been investigated so you will if you please get out as the train is on the point of starting sir i replied presenting him general shields pass here is a pass which i beg you will examine you will find that it * my maid and myself to pass on any road to martinsburg he reflected for some time and at last said well i scarcely know how to act in your case orders have been issued for your arrest and yet you have a pass from the general allowing you to return home however i shall take the responsibility upon my shoulders convey you with the other prisoners to baltimore and hand you over to general dix i played my rle of submission as gracefully as i could for where resistance is impossible it is still left to the vanquished to yield with dignity the train by which we travelled was the first that had been run through from wheeling to baltimore since the damage done to the permanent way by the confederates had been repaired we had not proceeded far when i observed an old friend of mine mr m of baltimore a gentleman whose sympathies were strongly enlisted on the side of the south at my request he took a seat beside me and after we had conversed for some time upon indifferent topics he told me in a whisper that he had a small confederate flag concealed about his person manage to give it me i said i am already a prisoner besides free or in chains i shall always glory in the possession of the emblem mr m watched his opportunity and when all eyes were turned from us he stealthily and quickly drew the little flag from his bosom and placed it in my hand we had eluded the vigilance of the officer under whose surveillance i was travelling and i leave my readers to imagine his surprise when i drew it forth from my pocket and with a laugh waved it over our heads with a gesture of triumph it was a daring action but my captivity had i think superadded the courage of despair to the * i had already acquired in my countrys service the first emotions of the federal officer and his men were those of indignation but better feelings succeeded and they allowed it was an excellent joke that a convoy of confederate prisoners should be brought in under a confederate flag and that flag raised by a lady upon our arrival at baltimore i was taken to the * house one of the largest and best hotels in the city where i must in justice say i was treated with all possible courtesy and consideration and permission to see my friends was at once and * granted as soon as it was known that i was in baltimore a prisoner and alone i was visited not merely by my personal friends but by those who knew me by reputation only for baltimore is confederate to its hearts core i remained a prisoner in the * house about a week at the expiration of which time general dix the officer in command having heard nothing against me decided to send me home i arrived safely at martinsburg which was now occupied in force by the federal troops here i was placed under a strict surveillance and forbidden to leave the town i was incessantly watched and persecuted and at last the restrictions imposed upon me became so irksome and vexatious that my mother resolved to intercede with major walker the provostmarshal on my behalf the result of this intercession was that he granted us both a pass by way of winchester to front royal with a view to my being sent on to join my relations at richmond upon arriving at winchester we had much difficulty in getting permission to proceed for general shields had just occupied front royal and had prohibited all intercourse between that place and winchester however lieutenantcolonel fillebrowne of the 10th maine regiment who was acting as provost marshal at length relented and allowed us to go on our way it was almost twilight when we arrived at the shenandoah river we found that the bridges had been destroyed and no means of transport left but a * which the yankees monopolized for their own exclusive purposes here we should have been subjected to much inconvenience and delay had it not been for the courtesy and kindness of captain * through whose intervention we were enabled to cross at once it was quite dark when we reached the village and to our great surprise we found the family domiciled in a little cottage in the courtyard the residence having been appropriated by general shields and his staff however we were glad enough to find ourselves at our journeys end and to sit down to a comfortable dinner for which fatigue and a long fast had sharpened our appetite as soon as we had satisfied our hunger i sent in my card to general shields who promptly returned my missive in person he was an irishman and endowed with all those graces of manner for which the better class of his countrymen are justly famous nor was he devoid of the humour for which they are no less notorious to my application for leave to pass * through his lines en route for richmond he replied that old jacksons army was so demoralized that he dared not trust me to their tender mercies but that they would be annihilated within a few days and after such a desirable consummation i might wander whither i would this of course was mere * on his part but i am convinced he felt confident of immediate and complete success or he would not have allowed some expressions to escape him which i turned to account in short he was completely off his guard and forgot that a woman can sometimes listen and remember general shields introduced me to the officers of his staff two of whom were young irishmen and to one of these captain k i am indebted for some very remarkable * some withered flowers and last not least for a great deal of very important information which was carefully transmitted to my countrymen i must avow the flowers and the poetry were comparatively * in my eyes but let captain k be consoled these were days of war not of love and there are still other ladies in the world besides the rebel spy the night before the departure of general shields who was about as he informed us to whip jackson a council of war was held in what had formerly been my aunts drawingroom immediately above this was a * containing a closet through the floor of which i observed a hole had been bored whether with a view to espionage or not i have never been able to ascertain it occurred to me however that i might turn the discovery to account and as soon as the council of war had assembled i stole softly upstairs and lying down the floor of the closet applied my ear to the hole and found to my great joy i could distinctly hear the conversation that was passing below the council prolonged their discussion for some hours but i remained motionless and silent until the proceedings were brought to a conclusion at one oclock in the morning as soon as the coast was clear i crossed the courtyard and made the best of my way to my own room and took down in * everything i had heard which seemed to me of any importance i felt convinced that to rouse a servant or make any disturbance at that hour would excite the suspicions of the federals by whom i was surrounded accordingly i went straight to the stables myself saddled my horse and galloped away in the direction of the mountains fortunately i had about me some passes which i had from time to time procured for confederate soldiers returning south and which owing to various circumstances had never been put in requisition they now however proved invaluable for i was twice brought to a * by the challenge of the federal sentries and who would inevitably have put a period to my adventurous career had they not been beguiled by my false passport once clear of the chain of sentries i dashed on unquestioned across fields and along roads through * and marshes until after a * of about fifteen miles i found myself at the door of mr m s house all was still and quiet not a light was to be seen i did not lose a moment in springing from my horse and running up the steps i knocked at the door with such vehemence that the house reechoed with the sound it was not until i had repeated my summons at intervals of a few seconds for some time that i heard the response who is there given in a sharp voice from a window above it is i but who are you what is your name belle boyd i have important intelligence to communicate to colonel ashby is he here no but wait a minute i will come down the door was opened and mrs m drew me in and exclaimed in a tone of astonishment my dear where did you come from and how on earth did you get here oh i forced the sentries i replied and here i am but i have no time to tell the how and the why and the wherefore i must see colonel ashby without the loss of a minute tell me where he is to be found upon hearing that his party was a quarter of a mile farther up the wood i turned to depart in search of them and was in the very act of * when a door on my right was thrown open and revealed colonel ashby himself who could not conceal his surprise at seeing me standing before him good god miss belle is this you where did you come from have you dropped from the clouds or am i dreaming i first convinced him he was wide awake and that my presence was substantial and of the earth not a visionary * from the world of spirits then without farther * i proceeded to narrate all i had overheard in the closet of which i have before made mention i gave him the * and started on my return i arrived safely at my aunts house after a two hours ride in the course of which i ran the blockade of a sleeping sentry who awoke to the sound of my horses hoofs just in time to see me disappear round an abrupt turning which shielded me from the bullet he was about to send after me upon getting home i * my horse and turned in if i may be permitted the expression which is certainly expressive rather than refined just as aurora springing from the rosy bed of * began her pursuit of the flying hour in plain english just as day began to break a few days afterwards general shields marched south laying a trap as he supposed to catch poor old jackson and his demoralized army leaving behind him to occupy front royal one squadron of cavalry one field battery and the 1st maryland regiment of infantry under command of colonel * major * of philadelphia being appointed provost marshal my mother returned home and it was arranged that i should remain with my grandmother until an opportunity of travelling south in safety should present itself within a few days after my mothers departure my cousin alice and i applied to major * for a pass to winchester he at first declined to comply with our request but afterwards relented and promised to let us have the necessary passport on the following day accordingly next morning may 21st my cousin one of the servants and myself were up betimes and equipped for the journey the carriage was at the door but no passes made their appearance and when we sent to inquire for the major we were informed he had gone out on a scout and would probably not be back until late at night we were of course in great perplexity when to our relief lieutenant h belonging to the squadron of cavalry stationed in the village made his appearance and asked what was the matter i explained our case and said now lieutenant h i know you have permission to go to winchester and you profess to be a great friend of mine prove it by assisting me out of this dilemma and pass us through the pickets this i knew he could easily manage as they were furnished from his own troop after a few moments hesitation lieutenant h consented little thinking of the consequences that were to ensue he mounted the box my cousin myself and the servant got inside and off we set shortly before we got to winchester lieutenant h got down from his seat with the intention of walking the rest of the way as he had some business at the camp which was close to the town finding we could not return the same day we agreed to remain all night with some friends early next morning a gentleman of high social position came to the house at which we were staying and handed me two packages of letters with these words miss boyd will you take these letters and send them through the lines to the confederate army this package he added pointing to one of them is of great importance the other is trifling in comparison this also he went on to say pointing to what appeared to be a little note is a very important paper try to send it carefully and safely to jackson or some other responsible confederate officer do you understand i do and will obey your orders promptly and implicitly i replied as soon as the gentleman had left me i concealed the most important documents about the person of my negro servant as i knew that intelligent * ladies and gentlemen of colour were * and had carte blanche to do what they pleased and to go where they liked without hindrance or molestation on the part of the yankee authorities the less important package i placed in a little basket and * wrote upon the back of it the words kindness of lieutenant h the small note upon which so much stress had been laid i resolved to carry with my own hands and knowing colonel fillebrowne was never displeased by a little flattery and a few delicate attentions i went to the * and chose a very handsome bouquet which i sent to him with my compliments and with a request that he would be so kind as to permit me to return to front royal the colonels answer was in accordance with the politeness of his nature he thanked the dear lady for so sweet a compliment and enclosed the * pass lieutenant h having finished his business at the camp rejoined our party and we all set out on our return nothing happened until we reached the * when two * fellows who proved to be detectives rode up one on each side of the carriage we have orders to arrest you said one of them looking in at the window and addressing himself to me for what i asked upon suspicion of having letters he replied then turning to the coachman he ordered him to drive back forthwith to colonel beales headquarters upon arriving there we were desired to get out and walk into the office my cousin trembled like a poor bird caught in a snare and to tell the truth i felt very much * myself although i did not for a moment lose my presence of mind upon the preservation of which i well knew our only hopes rested the negress almost paralyzed by fear followed my cousin and myself and it was in this order we were ushered into the awful presence of our * and judge the first question asked was had i any letters i knew that if i said no our persons would be immediately searched and my falsehood detected i therefore drew out from the bottom of the basket the package i had placed there and which it will be remembered was of minor importance and handed it with a bow to the colonel what exclaimed he in an angry tone what is this kindness of lieutenant h what does this mean is this all you have look for yourself i replied turning the basket upside down and emptying its contents upon the floor as to this * on the letter i continued it means nothing it was a thoughtless act of mine i assure you lieutenant h knew nothing about the letter or that it was in my possession the lieutenant turned very pale for it suddenly occurred to him that he had in his pocket a little package which i had asked him to carry for me he immediately drew it out and threw it upon the table when to his consternation and to the surprise of the colonel it was found to be inscribed with the very identical words kindness of lieutenant h which had already excited the suspicions of the federal commander this made matters worse and when the package upon being opened disclosed a copy of that decidedly rebel newspaper the maryland * the colonel entertained no further doubt of lieutenant * complicity and guilt it was in vain i asserted his innocence and repeated again and again that it was impossible he could know that a folded packet contained an obnoxious journal and that it was highly improbable to say the least of it he could be an * in my possession of the letter what is that you have in your hand was the only reply to my remonstrances and expostulations on behalf of the unfortunate officer i had so unintentionally betrayed what this little scrap of paper you can have it if you wish it is nothing here it is and i approached nearer to him with the seeming intention of placing it in his hand but i had taken the resolution of following the example set by harvey birch in coopers wellknown novel of the spy in the event of my being positively commanded to stand and deliver fortunately however for me the colonels wrath was diverted from the guilty to the guiltless he was so incensed with lieutenant h that he forgot the very existence of belle boyd and the precious note was left in my possession we were then and there dismissed colonel * * himself with giving a hurried order to the effect that i was to be closely watched he then proceeded to the investigation of lieutenant * case bare suspicion was the worst that could be urged against him yet upon this doubtful evidence or rather in the absence of anything like evidence a courtmartial composed of officers of the federal army dismissed him from the service some time after the adventure i have just related the secret of our arrest transpired a servant had observed the gentleman to whom i have alluded give me the letter in my friends house at winchester he gave information and the result was a telegram was sent to major * who was already incensed against me for having slipped through the pickets and got to winchester without his pass he communicated at once with colonel * and our arrest followed as i have described had it not been for the curious manner in which lieutenant h was involved in the affair and in which that unoffending officer was so unjustly treated very much to my regret i should not have escaped so easily my prisoner battle of 23rd may my share in the action the federals fire upon me the little note once more the confederates are victorious letter from general stonewall jackson among the federals who then occupied front royal was one mr clark a reporter to the new york herald and although an irishman by no means a gentleman he was domiciled at headquarters which were established as i have before mentioned at my aunts residence and thus it was that i saw him daily for we could not possibly get into the street without crossing the courtyard and passing through the hall way this mr clark endeavoured upon several occasions to intrude his society upon me and although i told him plainly his advances were extremely distasteful he persevered so far that i was forced more than once to bolt the door of the room in which my cousin and myself were seated in his face these * he never forgave and from an intrusive friend he became an inveterate enemy it is to him i am indebted for the first violent undisguised abuse with which my name was coupled in any federal journal but i must do the editors of the yankee newspapers the justice to admit they were not slow to follow the example set them by mr clark they seemed to think that to insult an innocent young girl was to prove their manhood and evince their patriotism i think my english readers will neither admire their taste nor applaud their spirit on the evening of the 23rd may i was sitting at the window of our room reading to my grandmother and cousin when one of the servants rushed in and shouted or rather shrieked oh miss belle i * de revels am * for de yankees are * * fuss in de street i immediately sprang from my seat and went to the door and i then found that the servants report was true the streets were thronged with yankee soldiers hurrying about in every direction in the greatest confusion i asked a federal officer who just then happened to be passing by what was the matter he answered that the confederates were approaching the town in force under generals jackson and ewell that they had surprised and captured the outside pickets and had actually advanced within a mile of the town without the attack being even suspected now he added we are endeavouring to get the ordnance and the quartermasters stores out of their reach but what will you do i asked with the stores in the large depot burn them of course but suppose the rebels come upon you too quickly then we will fight as long as we can by any possibility show a front and in the event of defeat make good our retreat upon winchester burning the bridges as soon as we cross them and finally effect a junction with general banks force i parted with the federal officer and returning to the house i began to walk quietly upstairs when suddenly i heard the report of a rifle and almost at the same moment i encountered mr clark who in his rapid descent from his room very nearly knocked me down great heavens what is the matter he ejaculated as soon as he had regained his breath which the * and flight had deprived him of nothing to speak of said i only the rebels are coming and you had best prepare yourself for a visit to libby prison he answered not a word but rushed back to his room and commenced compressing into as small a compass as possible all the * upon which he so much plumed himself and upon which he relied for fame and credit with the illustrious journal to which he was contributor it was his intention to collect and secure these inestimable treasures and then to skedaddle i immediately went for my * and on my way to the balcony in front of the house from which position i intended to reconnoitre i was obliged to pass mr clarks door it was open but the key was on the outside the temptation of making a yankee prisoner was too strong to be resisted and yielding to the impulse i quietly locked in the special correspondent of the new york herald after this feat i hurried to the balcony and by the aid of my glasses descried the advance guard of the confederates at the distance of about threequarters of a mile marching rapidly upon the town to add to my anxiety my father who was at that time upon general garnetts staff was with them my heart beat alternately with hope and fear i was not ignorant of the trap the yankees had set for my friends i was in possession of much important information which if i could only contrive to convey to general jackson i knew our victory would be secure without it i had every reason to anticipate defeat and disaster the intelligence i was in possession of instructed me that general banks was at * with four thousand men that the small force at winchester could be readily reinforced by general white who was at harpers ferry and that generals shields and * were a short distance below front royal while fremont was beyond the valley further and this was the vital point that it had been decided all these separate divisions should cooperate against general jackson i again went down to the door and this time i observed standing about in groups several men who had always professed attachment to the cause of the south i demanded if there was one among them who would venture to carry to general jackson the information i possessed they all with one accord said no no you go i did not stop to reflect my heart though beating fast was not appalled i put on a white sunbonnet and started at a run down the street which was thronged with federal officers and men i soon cleared the town and gained the open fields which i traversed with unabated speed hoping to escape observation until such time as i could make good my way to the confederate line which was still rapidly advancing i had on a dark blue dress with a little fancy white apron over it and this contrast of colours being visible at a great distance made me far more conspicuous than was just then agreeable the skirmishing between the outposts was sharp the main forces of the opposing armies were disposed as follows the federals had placed their artillery upon a lofty eminence which commanded the road by which the confederates were advancing their infantry occupied in force the hospital buildings which were of great size and sheltered by which they kept up an incessant fire the confederates were in line directly in front of the hospital into which their artillerymen were throwing shells with deadly precision for the yankees had taken this as a shelter and were firing upon the confederate troops from the windows at this moment the federal pickets who were rapidly falling back perceived me still running as fast as i was able and immediately fired upon me my escape was most providential for although i was not hit the * flew thick and fast about me and more than one struck the ground so near my feet as to throw the dust in my eyes nor was this all the federals in the hospital seeing in what direction the shots of their pickets were aimed followed the example and also opened fire upon me upon this occasion my life was spared by what seemed to me then and seems still little short of a miracle for besides the numerous bullets that whistled by my ears several actually pierced different parts of my clothing but not one reached my body besides all this i was exposed to a cross fire from the federal and confederate artillery whose shot and shell flew whistling and hissing over my head at length a federal shell struck the ground within twenty yards of my feet and the explosion of course sent the fragments flying in every direction around me i had however just time to throw myself flat upon the ground before the deadly engine burst and again providence spared my life springing up when the danger was passed i pursued my career still under a heavy fire i shall never run again as i ran on that to me memorable day hope fear the love of life and the determination to serve my country to the last conspired to fill my heart with more than feminine courage and to lend preternatural strength and * to my limbs i often marvel and even shudder when i reflect how i cleared the fields and bounded over the fences with the * of a deer as i neared our line i waved my bonnet to our soldiers to intimate that they should press forward upon which one regiment the 1st maryland rebel infantry and hays louisiana brigade gave me a loud cheer and without waiting for further orders dashed upon the town at a rapid pace they did not then know who i was and they were naturally surprised to see a woman on the battlefield and on a spot too where the fire was so hot their shouts of approbation and triumph rang in my ears for many a day afterwards and i still hear them not unfrequently in my dreams at this juncture the main body of the confederates was hidden from my view by a slight elevation which intervened between me and them my heart almost ceased to beat within me for the dreadful thought arose in my mind that our force must be too weak to be any match for the federals and that the gallant men who had just been * me were rushing upon a certain and fruitless death i accused myself of having urged them to their fate and now quite overcome by fatigue and by the feelings which tormented me i sank upon my knees and offered a short but earnest prayer to god then i felt as if my supplication was answered and that i was inspired with fresh spirits and a new life not only despair but fear also forsook me and i had again no thought but how to fulfill the mission i had already pursued so far i arose from my kneeling posture and had proceeded but a short distance when to my unspeakable indescribable joy i caught sight of the main body fast approaching and soon an old friend and connection of mine major harry douglas rode up and recognising me cried out while he seized my hand good god belle you here what is it oh harry i gasped out give me time to recover my breath for some seconds i could say no more but as soon as i had sufficiently recovered myself i produced the little note and told him all urging him to hurry on the cavalry with orders to them to seize the bridges before the retreating federals should have time to destroy them he instantly galloped off to report to general jackson who immediately rode forward and asked me if i would have an escort and a horse * to return to the village i thanked him and said no i would go as i came and then acting upon the information i had been spared to convey the confederates gained a most complete victory though the depot building had been fired and was burning our cavalry reached the bridges barely in time to save them from destruction the retreating federals had just crossed and were actually upon the point of lighting the slow match which communicating with the bursting charge would have * the arches in pieces so hasty was their retreat that they left all their killed and wounded in our hands although we lost many of our best and bravest among others the gallant captain * of ashbys cavalry who fell leading a brilliant and successful charge upon the federal infantry the day was ours and i had the heartfelt satisfaction to know that it was in consequence of the information i had conveyed at such risk to myself general jackson made the flank movement which led to such fortunate results and here let me pause a moment to do justice to the memory of a brave enemy colonel * who commanded the federals and who fought at their head with the courage of desperation until he fell mortally wounded the confederates following up theirs victory crossed the river by the still standing bridges and pushed on by the road which led to winchester general banks was startled from his lair at * and leaving everything but his own head and a handful of cavalry behind him with the victorious confederates in hot pursuit rushed through winchester and martinsburg and finally crossed the river at williamsport maryland and it is said that he and his command have never stopped running since during this hasty flight general banks halted for a few minutes to take breath in the main street of martinsburg upon the sidewalk were standing many children and young girls among whom was my little sister one of these girls recognising general banks aidedecamp walked up to him and said captain how long are you going to stay here until gabriel blows his horn replied he to this * * my sister quietly rejoined looking full in his face as she spoke ah captain if you were to hear jacksons horn just outside the town you would not wait for * nor did they wait for the echo of the confederate generals bugles had little less terror for them than the sound of the * trump when i first returned from the battlefield tired or to say the truth utterly enervated and exhausted the confederates were filing through the town and the enthusiastic * with which they greeted me did more than anything else could have done to revive my drooping spirits and restore my failing powers the dead and wounded were now being brought in and our house soon became a hospital notwithstanding my fatigue i contrived to render some assistance in dressing the wounds and alleviating the sufferings of our poor soldiers who consoled themselves in their agonies with the reflection that they had done their duty nobly and that their pangs were not embittered by the sting and remorse with which defeat always torments a true soldier among the dead who were brought next day to our house for interment were captains * baxter and * all of ashbys cavalry and major davis of louisiana to my great joy my father came safer out of the battle with but a very slight wound in the leg all the federals left in front royal were captured among them my particular friend mr clark who upon endeavouring to leave his room unseen during the confusion found himself locked in i afterwards heard an amusing account of the manner in which he extricated himself by letting himself down from the window this however was unfortunately a work of time and the delay was the cause of his capture he was being escorted a prisoner down the street when catching sight of me as i stood upon the doorstep he shouted out ill make you rue this its your doing that i am a prisoner here during the battle and while colonel fillebrowne was preparing to remove his effects from winchester a gentleman of high social position and southern proclivities stepped into his office and said colonel how on earth did you get into such a trap did you know nothing of the advance of the confederates colonel fillebrowne turned and pointing to the bouquet i had sent him only a day or two before he said that bouquet did all the mischief the donor of that gift is responsible for all this misfortune i could not but be aware that i had been of some service to my country and i had the further satisfaction of feeling that neither a desire of fame nor notoriety had been my motive for enacting the role i did in this sad drama i was not prepared however for that recognition of my services which was received on the very day they were rendered and which i here transcribe this short note which was written at mr richards house very near front royal was brought to me by a courier and i am free to confess i value it far beyond anything i possess in the world the object general jackson had in view was too important to admit of his leaving behind him an adequate force for the protection of front royal one regiment the 12th georgia infantry was all that could be spared and thus front royal was retaken by the federals just one week after its brilliant capture by our troops during our short possession of the town there was among the prisoners taken in the pursuit beyond the river and sent back into our custody a woman who represented herself to be the wife of a soldier belonging to the michigan cavalry she was handed over to me and i furnished her with clothing and did all that lay in my power to make her comfortable and happy upon the arrival of the federals under general * most of the 12th georgia were taken prisoners together with all the sick and wounded the woman of whom i have just spoken was of course liberated and the first use she made of her freedom was to report me to general kimball as a most dangerous rebel and a malignant enemy to the federal government the general immediately placed me under arrest and surrounded our house with sentries so that to escape was actually impossible within a few hours however after my incarceration general shields arrived and being senior in the service to general kimball naturally superseded him in the command of the army he at once released me and i thank him for his urbanity and kindness rumours soon reached us to the effect that the confederate army was retreating up the valley and once more all this portion of the country fell into the hands of the yankees tone of the northern press towards me general banks refuses to pass me south how i procure passes the two confederate soldiers i write to stonewall jackson novel method of conveying information my letter is intercepted i am warned to depart south without delay i prepare to leave the northern journals vied with one another in publishing the most extravagant and improbable accounts of my exploits as they were pleased to term them on the battlefield of the 23rd may one ascribed to belle boyd the honour of having directed the fire of the confederate artillery throughout the action another represented her as having by the force of her genius sustained the wavering counsels of the southern generals while a third described her as having sword in hand led on the whole of the attacking line to the capture of front royal but as i believe that the veracity of the yankee press is pretty well known and appreciated i shall give no more extracts from their eloquent pages at the conclusion of the last chapter i mentioned that general shields released me front the arrest under which general kimball had placed me upon the report of the ungrateful cidevant prisoner and after a short time finding no further persecution was resorted to i thought the opportunity favourable for making an attempt to get south meanwhile general banks had returned and encamped close to the town making my aunts house his headquarters it was to him therefore i applied for permission to depart where do you wish to go he asked to louisiana where my aunt resides but what will virginia do without you what do you mean general we always miss our bravest and most illustrious and how can your native state do without you i laughingly thanked him for the compliment and he conversed with the utmost good nature and pleasantry upon the part that i had taken in his recent defeat though a * abolitionist the general was certainly one of the most affable gentlemen i have ever met several weeks passed by in peace and quiet * by any incident worthy of record and at the expiration of this period front royal was again evacuated by the federal troops with the exception of the 3rd delaware infantry which corps was left in garrison their colonel was a very large coarse man with the manners and appearance of a butcher rather than of an officer on the other hand major * and lieutenant preston who officiated severally as provost and * marshal were upon all occasions not only courteous but kind the natural consequence of which behaviour was that they were both highly respected and esteemed by us rebels in the courtyard of the generals headquarters and at a few yards only from our cottage they had pitched a flag tent which served the purposes of their office and here it was that all passes for the south were granted or refused as the case might be how many of these were procured upon false * and transferred to recruits on their way to join the southern army or by whom this ingenious ruse was practiced i shall not here say i was one morning sitting in the drawingroom when i noticed two men dressed as confederate soldiers standing near the provostmarshals tent at my request my grandmother sent for the major who obeyed her summons without loss of time we asked him who the men were he told us they were paroled confederate soldiers procuring passes to go south we then asked if they might be permitted to dine with us and received a ready assent in the meantime they had disappeared but one of them shortly reappearing i accosted him thus wont you dine with us the major says you may with pleasure if you dine shortly i have only two or three hours allowed me to get beyond the pickets poor fellow said i but i am glad that you will soon be free wont you take a letter from me to general jackson upon his * to this request i went off towards my own room to write my despatch but as i was passing by the kitchen door one of the servants stopped me suddenly and exclaimed miss belle * dat man * * to i know no more about him than that he is a paroled rebel soldier going south miss belle dat man aint no rebel i seen him * de yankees in de street if he is got secesh clothes on he aint no secesh cant fool betsy dat way dat mans a spy dat mans a spy please god he am i however entertained a different opinion from that of the negro woman so i persevered in my intention and wrote a long friendly letter to general jackson at the same time i introduced a great deal of valuable information concerning the yankees the state of their army their movements and doings and matters of a like nature disregarding the warning voice of my sable cassandra i fancied the man was true and might be safely trusted so as soon as dinner was finished i called him aside and confided the letter to him with these words will you promise me faithfully upon the honour of a soldier to take the utmost care of this and deliver it safe to general jackson they tell me you are a spy but i do not believe it he of course denied the soft impeachment and swore by all the host of heaven to execute my commission with fidelity and despatch reader conceive my feelings when shortly after this mans departure one of the officers came in and informed me that he was a spy and was on his way to the confederate lines at harrisburg i immediately set about to rectify my unfortunate error and after some reflection i decided upon the following expedient i sat down and wrote major harry gilmore of the confederate cavalry a few lines giving an accurate account of the mans personal appearance and explaining the motive and circumstances of his journey south and by what means i had been entrapped into trusting him with at letter for general jackson this note i despatched by a conveyance to which we rebels had given the name of the underground railway the locomotive on this railway was an old negro and the * was an enormous silver watch from which the works had been extracted i sent off my train with orders that if in passing the pickets any one should inquire the time of day the answer must be that the imposing looking * was out of order and had ceased to mark the hours and minutes our friend the spy however went neither to harrisburg nor to general jackson but made his way straight to the federal general * and gave him my letter the general in his turn forwarded it to stanton the * who i make no doubt still retains it in his possession the fate of the spy like that of so many of his fraternity was tragic he was soon after detected in the pursuit of his calling on the rappahannock and hanged my readers perhaps may think i ought to congratulate myself upon having hitherto escaped a similar fate shortly after this adventure an officer came and told me that further * on my part might bring down upon me the severest punishment and hinted that the yankees once thoroughly incensed would not hesitate at the * of any * entertaining these views he recommended my immediate departure and this kind advice meeting with the approval of my grandmother i gave my consent and immediately my maid had orders to prepare for a journey to richmond it was on a tuesday that the officer promised to get a pass and we were to be sent through the lines on the next ensuing thursday but fate had ordained otherwise i am arrested by order of mr stanton federal secretary of war my boom and trunks are closely searched yankee disregard for the rights of personal property my departure for washington my escort i arrive at general whites headquarters in winchester it was on a lovely wednesday evening that our firm and valued friend lieutenant preston my cousin alice and myself were standing on the balcony watching the last rays of the setting sun as it sank behind the western hills our conversation turned upon the divided and unhappy state of our country we recalled the peaceful scenes and joyous days of the past which were so painfully contrasted by the present and we were forced to agree that we had nothing to expect from the future but a continuance if not an * of our calamities in such gloomy forebodings and in the interchange of apprehensions and regrets we passed some time and the twilight was fast deepening into gloom when we heard the sound of horses hoofs and straining our eyes through the darkness we discerned a large body of cavalry approaching the house i immediately conceived the idea that it was a * on their way to the mountains with the design of surprising major harry * cavalry and feared that their enterprise would prove successful unless the confederate officer should leave timely notice of his danger i ran at once to my room and wrote a hasty note in which i communicated my suspicions to major gilmore and warned him to be on his guard this note i transmitted in the manner i have described in a previous chapter by my underground railway after this feat i retired to bed and slept quietly undisturbed by any dream or vision of my approaching captivity next morning i rose early and soon after breakfast i went to the cottage door where i daily spent much of my time watching the movements of the persons who for various purposes * headquarters i had not been long at my post when i observed several yankee soldiers go into the * they immediately proceeded to drag out the carriage and pull it up at the door of headquarters where they put to the horses there was nothing very extraordinary in all this but in these anxious days the minds of all were in a perpetual state of tension and a slight incident was sufficient to cause alarm this may account for the strange feeling that came over me an irrepressible desire to ascertain who was to be the occupant of the carriage which was on the point of starting for a destination of which i was ignorant i walked out upon the balcony and looking up and down the street i saw that it was thronged with cavalry the men dismounted lounging about and conversing with each other in groups of twos and threes evidently waiting for the expected order to mount while i stood looking at this scene not without interest and curiosity one of the servants came to me and said miss belle de * wishes to see you in de drawingroom and * two * men wid him i immediately went downstairs and upon entering the room i found the major whose face wore an expression of excitement and nervousness there were as the servant had said two other men in the room with him one a tall finelooking man was introduced to me by the name and title of major sherman of the 12th illinois cavalry the other was low in stature coarse in appearance with a mean vile expression of countenance and a grizzly beard which it was evident had not made the acquaintance of water or a comb for weeks at least his small restless eyes glanced here and there with an expression of incessant watchfulness and suspicion all his features were repulsive in the extreme * a mixture of cowardice ferocity and cunning in a word his mien was unmistakably that of a finished villain who was capable of * any act however atrocious when stimulated by the promise of a reward in money this man was a good type of his order he was one of secretary stantons * a detective belonging to and employed and paid by that honourable branch of mr lincolns government the secret service department i had not been in the room more than a few moments when major * turned to me and said miss boyd major sherman has come to arrest you impossible for what i cried major sherman here interposed and speaking in a very kind manner assured me that although the duty he had to perform was painful to his feelings he was nevertheless forced to execute the orders of the secretary of war mr stanton and as he finished speaking the detective produced from his pocket the document which i transcribe as nearly as i can recollect such was the curt order that made me a prisoner and as remonstrance would have been idle and resistance vain nothing was left for me but quiet unconditional obedience the detective then informed me that it was his duty to examine all my luggage to this i could not do otherwise than assent and only begged that a few minutes might be granted to enable my servant to prepare my room which was in great confusion and that i might also be permitted to retire i made this request to the detective for it had not escaped my notice that major sherman was acting a subordinate part and was virtually at the disposal and under the orders of the former as no answer was returned to my question i took it for granted i had tacit permission to withdraw but my disgust was great when turning round upon the stairs i saw my * silently following at my heels i stopped short and said sir will not you wait until i see if my room is in a suitable condition for you to enter the reply was characteristic though not * no yer dont im * with yer yer got some papers yer want to get rid on and with these words he pushed violently past me and hastily entered my room my clothes were first seized and searched with the utmost scrutiny my dresses were examined closely and after being turned inside out and distorted into all sorts of fantastic shapes were flung in a pile upon the floor much to the horror and amazement of my maid who had employed a great part of the previous night in packing them safely and neatly and who was at a loss to understand the meaning of such treatment which appeared to her naturally enough so strange and unseemly my * next underwent an ordeal precisely similar to that which my upper garments had passed through and finally my desk and portfolio were discovered but here very fortunately my devoted servant came to the rescue with the * and courage of a heroine she well knew the value i attached to the contents of my portfolio and made a shrewd guess as to how far they would compromise me with my captor and his * acting upon a sudden impulse she made a swoop upon the repository of the greatest part of the evidence that could be adduced against me and rushing at headlong speed downstairs she gained the kitchen in time to burn all the papers it contained but some important papers were unfortunately in my writingdesk and these fell into the possession of the detective who also much to my regret made prize of a handsome pistol with belt and equipments complete which had been presented to me on the 4th july by a federal officer on the staff as a token he was pleased to say of his admiration of the spirit i had shown in defence of my mother and my home it had always been my hope to have some day an opportunity of begging general stonewall jacksons acceptance of a present made to me under very trying circumstances by a gallant and generous enemy but this could not be done the pistol now occupies a conspicuous place in the war department at washington and is entered in the catalogue of spoils in the following words a trophy captured from the celebrated rebel belle boyd not contented with the seizure of my own papers the emissary of mr stanton proceeded to break open the private escritoire of my uncle who was a lawyer and who had left it in my room for safekeeping during his absence from front royal the detective * up the * with mine bade me in the roughest manner and in the most offensive language be prepared to start within half an hour i asked permission to be indulged with the attendance of my maid but this request was refused with imprecations and she was only allowed to pack one trunk with apparel absolutely necessary to comfort if not to decency brief time was granted for the packing and before many minutes my solitary trunk was strapped to the back of the carriage i then nerved myself and walking into the drawingroom announced in firm unbroken accents that i was ready to start i preserved my composure unshaken although it was a hard trial to me to see my grandmother and cousin weeping piteously and beseeching major sherman in the most moving terms to spare me their supplications were vain and the detective stepping up close to my side ordered me to get into the carriage forthwith then came the final parting bitter enough god knows for i was being dragged from those to whom i was endeared by the associations of my happy youth no less than by the ties of nature and consigned to the safekeeping of a man whose countenance alone would have immediately convicted him of any crime of which he might anywhere have been accused my negro maid clasped her arms round my knees and passionately implored permission to attend me she was torn from me and i was hurried into the carriage without any opportunity of further expostulation on the part of myself or my relations the news of my arrest had spread quickly and the streets were by this time filled with soldiers and citizens of the town as i stepped into the carriage which for aught i knew was my funeral car i cast a rapid but comprehensive glance upon the crowd collected to witness my departure and the * i should sustain under such a trial upon many nay most of the faces that met my gaze sorrow and sympathy were written in unmistakable characters but there were nevertheless some looks the expression of which was that of exultation and malignant triumph i knew how closely i was watched by friend and foe and i resolved neither to make myself an object of derision to the one nor of pity to the other though my heart was throbbing my eyes were dry not a muscle of my face quivered no outward sign betrayed the * emotions that raged within i could not guess what fate was in store for me but i felt that if i might judge of the * of my captors by the bearing of their delegate it would be the part of wisdom to steel my mind against the worst that could ensue i was seated in the back of the carriage and just as we started my evil genius mounted the drivers seat in his hand he clutched a tin case which held the papers he had taken from my room and as he turned his ugly features round from time to time to scrutinize my looks my imagination pictured him to me as the ill * incarnation of satan himself i could not help associating him with the idea of edgar poes raven and asking myself if the fancy of the poet was to be realized in my case and the companionship of the bird was to cease only with my life that these were the visions of a disturbed mind i am now quite willing to allow but if my readers will bear in mind that i was young that i had just been torn from my friends that a long captivity appeared certain and death not improbable that while either fate was in abeyance i was in the custody of a man whose character was clearly adapted to his odious calling they will not be surprised that during a few hours my reason tottered and horrible imaginings got the better of my fortitude my escort consisted of # cavalry the officer in command of whom observed all the regular precautions prescribed by military law for a march through an enemys country in addition to the ordinary advance and rear guards fifty scouts were detached in skirmishing order to protect our right from surprise and an equal number to guard our left and in this order we advanced until about half our march was performed and we reached an eminence which commanded a view of the country for several miles round here at a dreary spot the cavalcade was brought to a halt fieldglasses and signal whistles were brought into requisition and many other to me mysterious forms were gone through i had not yet shaken off my terrors and i now resolved to collect my thoughts and devote what i believed to be my last moments to prayer for i could not then penetrate the motives which actuated the to me strange behaviour of my escort and i fully and firmly believed i should soon be dragged from the carriage and hanged from a bough of the * the leaves of which were rustling over the carriage i afterwards ascertained that it was from fear of a rescue by ashbys cavalry the that the precautions which alarmed me so much were taken and i make no doubt but that gallant confederate had he known of my situation would have brought me off or perished in the attempt after a long pause the word forward was given and our march was resumed at a walk in due course we gained the outskirts of winchester and were met by the remainder of the regiment by which i was escorted the whole amounting to # sabres some in front some in rear of the carriage marched in solemn procession down the main street of the town and i believe the citizens who rushed to the windows and doors at first supposed that the carriage which conveyed my small but living person was the funeral car of a general officer bearing the warrior to his place of interment it was about six oclock in the evening when i was brought to general whites headquarters which were fixed about a quarter of a mile beyond the town i was immediately ordered to alight and without a minutes delay i was ushered into his presence he received me with a graceful bow and bade me welcome with marked courtesy i returned his salutation with as much ease as i could assume and asked what he intended doing with me tomorrow replied he i shall send you on to the commanding officer at martinsburg he can best inform you what is to be done with you you will rest here after your journey for the night but surely i * you will at least allow me to remain with my friends in the village until the morning no no he rejoined rather * i cannot consent to that it would take a whole regiment to guard you for though the rebel cavalry should not enter the town to attempt your rescue i make no doubt that the citizens themselves would try it but surely i then pleaded you do not mean that i am to sleep here defenceless and alone in a tent at the mercy of your brigade i never yet slept in a tent when i was present with our army and how can i endure such a penance in the camp of my enemies my own tent replied the general with a low bow has been properly prepared for the reception of a lady whenever you wish to retire you can follow your inclinations and you may rest assured you shall sleep in perfect security supper was then brought in and it did not escape my notice that the table was decorated with a dazzling display of rich silver plate which i more than suspected had formerly been the property of some of our dear old virginian families and the thought that the rightful owners were at that moment miserable outcasts probably in want of the bread my federal lords despised effectually destroyed any appetite my sufferings might have left me i said not a word until supper was finished then rising quietly from my * i begged permission to retire to the tent which i had been informed was to be my * the general rang a small bell which was quickly answered by an intelligent contraband bearing two very massive silver * which like the spoons and forks were doubtless the spoils of my native province probably once the property of an intimate friend show this lady to the tent that has been prepared for her reception and these words with the accompaniment of a bow were all i had in exchange for the prayers and blessings i had been accustomed to carry with me to my bed no sooner had i entered the tent than the negro left me to sleep or to my own reflections for some time i listened to the tramp of the sentries as they paced to and fro outside then i tried to * my thoughts and forget my grief in attempting to guess how many yankee soldiers were told off to guard a single confederate girl but all would not do for the time being i was conquered in body and spirit my burden seemed heavier than i could bear i sat down upon my * and pressed my hands upon my aching brow and before long the fatigue and anxiety i had undergone stood me in stead and i fell asleep a false alarm arrival at martinsburg my mother and family visit me departure for washington my reception at the dpt the old capitol my prison room my treatment interview with the chief of detectives offers of liberty my reply a pleasing reminiscence of my captivity about halfpast three the following morning i was suddenly aroused from my comfortless slumbers by the beating of the long roll and by the reports of several muskets fired in quick succession officers half dressed sprang to arms rushed to their horses and rode off to the outposts meanwhile i had lighted my candle my heart beating high with hope for i persuaded myself that the alarm was caused by an attempt on the part of the confederates to effect my rescue i sat down anxiously awaiting the result when one of the officers who was rushing to the front stopped opposite my tent and shouted or rather roared out put out that light it is some signal to the rebels do you hear me i of course obeyed the mandate and a few minutes afterwards i heard the retreat beat upon which one of the sentries explained the meaning of what had happened and how it came to pass that the camp had been thrown into such a state of confusion it appeared that an obtuse cow had strayed from a neighbouring field and not understanding the challenge of the sentry had disregarded the order to halt although twice repeated hereupon the sentry who could not make out the outline of the cow in the darkness fired and the other sentries on his right and left taking the hint fired also though at what they aimed it would be difficult to say however fire they did at random as is the custom of undisciplined troops everywhere and thus all my hopes of a rescue were extinguished by a cow dawn was hardly breaking when i was ordered to get ready once more as i was to be taken directly to martinsburg my preparations were soon made and with two hundred for my escort i set forward at eight oclock we came to a halt at a small farmhouse standing by the roadside here breakfast had been prepared and i was informed the refreshment was at my disposal no sooner was my appetite satisfied a consummation which was easy and rapid than we resumed our journey to martinsburg at which * i arrived about one in the afternoon tired and exhausted with the fatigue and anxiety i had undergone major sherman * my forlorn condition very kindly stayed behind the cavalcade and prevailed upon his wife to accompany me to the camp which was pitched at a short distance on the north side of the town i was forthwith conducted to the tent of the commanding officer my head was now almost bursting with pain and i implored him to have me taken to my home which was close by in a suburb of the village there to rest and refresh myself for a few hours as i understood i was to start for washington at two oclock next morning i make no doubt my petition would have been granted had not the detective here interposed and informed the federal colonel that mr secretary stanton would probably take exception to such an indulgence which would give me an opportunity of holding communication with persons * to the united states government after putting this spoke in my wheel so to speak my amiable * went himself to my home and ransacked all my fathers private papers under pretence of hunting for communications from myself to my mother fortunately however he found none and his unwelcome visit was not crowned with the success he had anticipated to return to myself i was sitting on the * in my tent gazing listlessly about me when my attention was suddenly attracted to a carriage which was driving into the encampment it stopped and a lady rapidly * she was dressed in deep mourning a thick veil entirely concealed her face but i recognized her at once in spite of her disguise the feverish intelligence which accompanies danger and suffering was superadded to that natural instinct which though no one can explain all have experienced and i felt for i could not see that the visitor was my mother i sprang from my seat and rushed into her arms with a cry of joy i had no power to repress my poor dear child she said or rather gasped and then sank fainting at my feet they carried her into the tent and the first use she made of restored consciousness was to implore the colonel in the most moving terms to allow her to carry me home she begged him to trust the evidence of his own senses and to read in my haggard looks the bodily prostration to which i was reduced no less than the mental anguish which was consuming me and in very truth the iron had entered into my soul and my sufferings were almost greater than i could bear the colonel politely but firmly refused to grant my mothers prayer and i am willing to believe that in this refusal he was actuated by a stern sense of duty for his feelings so far prevailed as to induce him to authorize my removal to * hotel which is * to the station from which the trains for washington start no sooner had i a young girl weak and ill accompanied by my mother and mrs sherman set foot in the hotel than the building was girdled by a cordon of sentries twentyseven in number in addition to whom three were posted in the passage leading to my room and one more was stationed just outside my door and then with these material guarantees for my security and good behaviour my little sister my brothers and my mother were allowed to visit me it had been arranged that the detective who arrested me should be my escort as far as washington but i no loathed the sight of this man that i sent for colonel holt and implored him to substitute for the odious * any one of his officers who could be spared and upon whom he could rely for my safe conduct colonel holt kindly granted my request and detailed lieutenant steele of the 12th illinois cavalry for escort duty as the time for my arrival approached my feelings overpowered my selfcontrol and for once i yielded to a passionate burst of grief nor was i without an excuse for my weakness my nearest and dearest were lamenting around me and within a few minutes i was to be torn from their arms and consigned to the doubtful mercies of strangers and enemies my strength too failed me and just as the fatal moment drew near i sank down in a stupor from which i was suddenly and painfully awakened by the ominous * of the railway engine i nerved myself by a vigorous effort and within a few seconds i found myself seated in the train i say found myself for i have never been able distinctly to recall how i reached the station whether i walked or was carried i know not i was soon however conscious that lieutenant steele was by my side and that washington was my destination i felt grateful for the presence of an officer to whom i might reasonably look for protection and the reflection that come what would i had escaped the clutches of the detective roused my drooping spirits alas this infatuation was soon dispelled for upon looking about me i was horrified to see my evil genius occupying the left seat of the carriage the image of edgar poes raven arose in my mind and my disturbed imagination whispered that i was doomed to the perpetual companionship of an * fiend it afterwards transpired that this able * of mr stanton had telegraphed to the chief of detectives at washington to meet us at the dpt mr steele who had no idea i was to be thrown into prison observed that upon our arrival at washington i should go to willards hotel and after a short rest proceed to the office of the * this plan however was by no means in accordance with the programme drawn up by the detective he was one of mr stantons chosen and trusted agents he doubtless well knew what was in store for me and he did not scruple to presume upon his position and use very sharp words to lieutenant steele it was about nine oclock in the evening when we arrived at washington but notwithstanding the lateness of the hour a very large concourse of people had assembled in and about the dpt in order to catch a glimpse of the wonderful rebel for the news of my arrest had preceded my arrival as i stepped upon the platform the chief of the detectives another kindred spirit of mr stantons seized me roughly by the arm and in a gruff voice shouted out come on ill attend to you he was then proceeding to push me through the crowd when lieutenant steele thrusting himself forward protested vehemently against such usage and declared that i should not be treated in so barbarous a manner that i was a lady and that my character and position should be respected the torrent of abuse that was poured upon him for thus endeavouring to take my part was conveyed in words too horrible to bear repetition and at that moment i would gladly have lain down and died for the thought flashed across my mind my god if this is the beginning what will the end be amongst the crowd i had many sympathizers but they dared not interfere at washington might was indeed right and i will venture to say that the arbitrary exercise of power by the united states government has cast into the shade all that we read of the spanish inquisition and all that we hear of russian domination in poland a word of encouragement nay a whisper of condolence would have been sufficient to introduce an imprudent friend to that receptacle which was awaiting me a prison cell i was thrust into a carriage and the order drive to the old capitol was promptly given but before it could be obeyed lieutenant steele who had been very unceremoniously dismissed from further attendance upon me stepped up and politely begged permission to wait upon me to prison to a gruff refusal he firmly rejoined i am determined to see her out of your hands at least the carriage was driven at a rapid pace and we soon came within sight of my future home a vast brick building like all prisons sombre chilling and repulsive its dull damp walls look out upon the street its * * are further darkened by heavy iron * through which the miserable inmates may soothe their captivity by gazing upon those who are still free but whose freedom hangs but by a slender thread such is the calm retreat provided by a free and enlightened community for those of its citizens who have the audacity to express their disapproval

recesses of the * the most jealous care the most unceasing vigilance was observed in order that the mystery of their doom should never be * the * de cachet which was the * of their destruction was in

of this generation have parted with that freedom without receiving so much as a mess of * in exchange for their glorious birthright to return to my narrative upon my arrival at the prison i was ushered into a small office a clerk who was writing at a desk looked up for a moment and informed me the superintendent would attend to my business immediately the words were hardly uttered when mr wood entered the room and i was aware of the presence of a man of middle height powerfully built with brown hair fair complexion and keen * eyes mr wood * himself i believe upon his * extraction but i can safely * that beneath his rough exterior there beats a warm and generous heart and so this is the celebrated rebel spy said he i am very glad to see you and will endeavour to make you as comfortable as possible so whatever you wish for ask for it and you shall have it i am glad i have so distinguished a personage for my guest come let me show you to your room we traversed the hall ascended a flight of stairs and found ourselves in a short narrow passage up and down which a sentry paced and into which several doors opened one of these doors no 6 was thrown open and behold my prison cell mr wood after repeating his injunction to me to ask for whatever i might wish and with the promise that he would send me a servant and that i should not be locked in as long as i behaved myself withdrew and left me to my reflections at the moment i did not quite understand the meaning of the last indulgence but within a few minutes i was given a copy of the rules and relations of the prison which set forth that if i held any communication whatever with the other prisoners i should be punished by having my door locked there was nothing remarkable in the shape or size of my apartment except that two very large windows took up nearly the whole of one side of the wall upon taking an inventory of my effects i found them to be as follows a * a * an iron bedstead a table and some chairs from the windows i had a view of part of pennsylvania avenue and far away in the country the residence of general floyd * states secretary of war where i had formerly passed many happy hours at first i could not help indulging in reminiscences of my last visit to washington and contrasting it with my present forlorn condition but rousing myself from my reverie i bethought myself of the indulgence promised me and asked for a rockingchair and a fire not that i require the latter for the room was already very warm but i fancied a bright blaze would make it look more cheerful my trunk after being subjected to a thorough scrutiny was sent up to me and having plenty of time at my disposal i unpacked it leisurely upon each floor of the prison were posted sentries within sight and call of each other the sentry before my door was no 6 and when i had occasion for my servant i had to request him to summon the corporal of the guard my attendant was an intelligent contraband who was extremely useful to me during my enforced residence in the old capitol i had not unpacked my trunk when dinner was served and here i shall do plain justice by * the bill of fare and it will be allowed i can claim no commiseration on the plea of * diet though such had been ordered for me by mr stanton soup beef steak chicken boiled corn tomatoes irish stew potatoes bread and butter * peaches pears grapes this with but little variety constituted my dinner every day until released at eight oclock mr wood came to my room accompanied by the chief of the detectives who desired an interview with me on the part of the secretary at war i begged this worthy to be seated a request he immediately complied with and he then delivered the following graceful exhortation which i transcribe verbatim aint you pretty tired of your prison * ive come to get you to make a free confession now of what youve did agin our cause and as weve got plenty of proof agin you you might as well acknowledge at once sir i replied i do not understand you and furthermore i have nothing to say when you have informed me on what grounds i have been arrested and given me a copy of the charges preferred against me i will mare my statement but i shall not now commit myself thereupon the oath of allegiance was proffered and i was * at some length upon the enormity of my offense and given to understand the cause of the south was hopeless say now wont you take the oath of allegiance remember mr stanton will hear of all this he sent me here to this peroration i replied tell mr stanton from me i hope that when i commence the oath of allegiance to the united states government my tongue may * to the roof of my mouth and that if ever i sign one line that will show to the world that i owe the united states government the slightest allegiance i hope my arm may fall paralysed at my side this speech of mine he immediately took down in his notebook and growing very angry at my determination he called out well if this is your resolution youll have to lay here and die and serve you right sir i retorted if it is a crime to love the south its cause and its president then i am a criminal i am in your power do with me as you please but i fear you not i would rather lie down in this prison and die than leave it owing allegiance to such a government as yours now leave the room for so thoroughly am i disgusted with your conduct towards me that i cannot endure your presence longer scarcely had i finished my defiance which i confess was spoken in a loud tone of voice when cheers and cries of bravo reached my ears until that moment i was not aware that the rooms on the floor with my own were occupied for having kept my door shut all day i had had no means of noticing what was passing around me my door however had been left open during my interview with the detective consequently my neighbours whom i afterwards ascertained to be confederate officers and englishmen had overheard our whole conversation and hailed with applause the firmness with which i had rejected mr stantons overtures of liberty * as they were upon my renunciation of the confederacy and on my allegiance to the federal government and now mr wood taking pity upon me withdrew the detective saying come we had better go the lady is tired within a few minutes of their departure i heard a low significant cough and as i turned in the direction from whence it proceeded something small and white fell at my feet i picked it up and found that it was a minute * basket upon which were painted miniature confederate flags round it was wrapped a small piece of paper upon which were traced a few words expressive of sympathy with my misfortunes i afterwards found out that the author of this short communication was an englishman and i can assure him that his kindness was like a ray of light from heaven breaking into the cell of a condemned prisoner i wrote a hasty reply and watching my opportunity threw it to him i then lay down on my bed in a tranquil i had almost said a happy frame of mind and i closed my first day in a dungeon by repeating to myself more than once stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage a free and quiet mind can take these for a hermitage my first night in prison the secret telegraph an incident in connection with president jefferson daviss portrait i am punished for my indiscretion i am permitted to walk in the prison yard where i meet with a relation i am informed i am to be exchanged departure from washington the first night in a convent forms the subject of a melancholy but beautiful picture my first night in a prison must be painted in dark colours * by the radiance that plays upon the features of the sleeping devotee who has of her own free will cast aside the world exulting in the belief that the voluntary sacrifice of youth love and all the ties of nature will be more than * by an immortality of bliss her dreams are of paradise enthusiasm comes to the aid of religion and gives her a foretaste of eternity her soul is gone before her dust to heaven prophets angels and saints people her silent cell a vision of glory streams in through her narrow window and the first night in the convent is the night of ecstasy i said at the conclusion of my last chapter that i was comforted by the spontaneous proof of sympathy given by my unknown correspondent but my situation was too painful to admit of real lasting consolation the medicine administered was at best but a momentary stimulant the reaction soon set in and as my fatigue gained ground the sense of my miserable condition prevailed against my bodily energies i rose from my bed and walked to the window the moon was shining brightly how i longed that it were in my power to spring through the iron bars that caught and scattered her beams around the room the city was asleep but to my disordered imagination its sleep appeared feverish and perturbed far away the open country visible in the clear night looked the express image of peace and repose god made the country and man made the towns i thought as i contrasted the close atmosphere of my city prison with the clear air of the fields beyond what would i not have given to exchange the sound of the sentrys measured tread for the wild shriek of the owl and the drowsy flight of the * the room which was appropriated to me had formerly been the * of the old hall of congress and had been repeatedly * by clay webster calhoun and other statesmen of their age and mark a thousand strange fancies filled my brain and nearly drove me mad the phantoms of the past rose up before me and i fancied i could hear the voices of the departed orators as they declaimed against the abuses and errors of the day and gave their powerful aid to the cause of general liberty they never dreamed that the very walls which reechoed the eloquence of freedom would ere long confine the victims of an * theirs was the bright day ours is the dark morrow of which the evil is more than sufficient those great men for great they unquestionably were lacked not the gift of prophecy for they did not fail to discern the little cloud then no bigger than a mans hand which was gathering in the horizon that dark speck which was so soon to * a tempest far blacker than that from which the chariot of * made haste to escape throughout that long dreary night i stood at the window watching thinking and praying it seemed to me that morning would never come * that streak of dawning grey would never * into day so heavily it rolled away before the eastern flame but the morning came at last the herald let me hope from a brighter world of another morrow to us no sooner did the first faint light find its way through the windows than i threw myself again upon my bed and almost immediately sank into a deep sleep it was about nine oclock i believe when i was aroused by a loud knocking at my door what is it i cried springing up the officer calling the roll to ascertain that no one has escaped you do not expect me to get through these iron bars do you no indeed was the chuckling rejoinder and immediately afterwards i heard the officers retreating footsteps as he passed on in the execution of his duty soon after the servant who had been assigned to me came to make preparations for breakfast and as my morning meal was no less ample and choice than my dinner of the preceding evening i will not detain my readers with a second prison bill of fare it was but a few minutes after breakfast when the sentry directly outside my door was relieved i listened attentively to catch the orders given to the relief they were you will not allow this lady to come outside her door or talk to any of those fellows in the room opposite and if she wants anything call the corporal of the guard now dont let these rebels * yer there was no more information to be gained for the moment so i sat down and amused myself with the morning papers which had been brought to me with my breakfast they all contained an account of my capture and a summary of my career the subjectmatter was of course personally interesting although in every instance my motives were misconstrued and my character was * i must however admit that many of the most bitter * then published of me were contradicted not many days afterwards in the very same journals which had originally circulated them there was a narrow space behind the prison which was reserved for the prisoners exercise an indulgence they were granted at stated hours on their way to their * most of them had to pass my door and in the procession i recognised on the second day of my imprisonment several of my old friends and acquaintances who had formerly belonged to the army of virginia the tedious day wore on and a shudder passed over me as i recalled the hideous thoughts which had banished sleep throughout the previous night late in the evening when my servant came with my tea she told me that many prisoners had been brought in during the day and that two of the newly arrived captives had been consigned to the room adjoining mine by this time it had become known throughout the length and breadth of the * that i was no other than that persecuted young lady belle boyd acting upon this knowledge my neighbours who were the friends of happier days devised a scheme by means of which they were enabled to make themselves known to me at about eleven oclock i sat down and opened my bible i selected a chapter the promises contained in which are peculiarly consoling to the captive but i had not read more than two or three verses when my attention was distracted by a knock against the wall i listened with attention and presently felt sure that the next sound which reached my ears was that made by a knife * out the plaster of the wall within a few minutes the point of a long * was visible and i was not slow to cooperate with those pioneers of free communication the inmates of the next room i made use of the knife that remained on my * and before long the two knives had conjointly made an aperture large enough to admit of the transmission of notes rolled tight and of the circumference of a mans forefinger the clandestine correspondence that was thus carried on was on either side of the wall a source of much pleasure and served to * many a tedious hour in the room immediately above mine and in which mrs greenhow had been incarcerated and suffered so much for five long weary months were confined some gentlemen of * they had contrived to loosen a plank in the floor and to make an aperture through which the occupant of the room beneath them might receive and return letters whenever i desired to communicate with the prisoners whose rooms were on the opposite side of the passage i adopted the expedient of wrapping my note round a marble which i rolled across taking care that the sentrys back was turned when my missive was started on its voyage of discovery i have described how i established a post between my room and the room on my right the same system was applied with equal success to the one on the left which was then the abode of major fitzhugh of stuarts staff and major morse of ewells this room which joined with many others became a medium of communication with all and we were soon enabled to transmit intelligence to each other throughout the prison it was on the fourth morning of my * as i was watching from my door the prisoners going down to breakfast that a little frenchman handed me unobserved a * portrait of jefferson davis this i forthwith hung up in my room over the mantelpiece with this inscription below it three cheers for jeff davis and the southern confederacy one of the prison officials lieutenant holmes passing by my door caught sight of the hostile presidents likeness and the words with which i had decorated it rushing like a madman into my room he tore it down with many violent oaths for this he said you shall be locked in and he was as good as his word for he turned the key in the door as he left the room my offense was severely punished i was kept a close prisoner and so little air was stirring in the sultry month of july that i grew very ill and faint and at times i really thought i should have died from the oppressive heat of the room and this misery i had to endure for several weeks at last mr wood paid me a visit and observing how pale and ill i had become under such rigorous treatment took pity upon me and gave orders that my door should be once more left open soon after i was granted the further indulgence of half an hours walk daily in that portion of the prison yard which had been assigned to ladies for exercise one day whilst standing in the doorway my attention was attracted to an old gentleman almost bent double with age his long white hair hung down to his shoulders whilst his beard grey with the heavy touch of old father times fingers reached nearly to his waist a feeling of pity took possession of my soul and i could not but help thinking as i gazed upon him poor old man what an unfit place for you even i the delicate girl can better stand the hardships of this dreary comfortless place than you and what was his crime this he was designated a traitor to the northern government because he firmly believed that the constitution as it was should remain * i afterwards learnt that he was mr * the editor of the * iowa crescent and who when released published a look the prisoner of state which was however suppressed by the secretary of war stanton the rules of the prison of course interdicted all intercourse between the prisoners but alas i was on one occasion taken so completely by surprise as to obey my first impulse and commit a flagrant breach of orders i was walking up and down my seven feet by nine promenade when i suddenly recognized one of my cousins john * a young officer in * cavalry so glad was i to see him that i never thought of consequences but rushed up to exchange a few words with him the charged bayonet of the sentry soon checked my impetuosity and i was summarily sent back to my room although * had not expired my unfortunate cousin was at once removed to the * it was late one evening and i was sitting reading at my open door when mr wood came down the stairs exclaiming all you rebels get ready you are going to dixie tomorrow and miss belle is going with you at this joyful news all the prisoners within hearing of the tidings of their approaching * joined in three hearty cheers for my part i actually screamed for joy so suddenly had my return to freedom been announced the next day all the prisoners whose turn for exchange had come were drawn up in line in the prison yard soldiers were stationed from the door of the prison halfway across the street which was thronged by a dense crowd brought together by curiosity to witness the departure of the rebel prisoners two hundred captives * of the officers and myself were then passed beyond the prison walls and formed in line on the opposite side of the street i stepped into an open carriage followed by major fitzhugh who had been told off to convey me to richmond i carried concealed about me two gold * one of which was intended for general jackson the other for general joe johnston as we drove off the confederate prisoners cheered us loudly their * were taken up by the crowd so that the whole street and square resounded with applause when we arrived at the wharf we were sent on board the steamer * which lay at her moorings all that night i shall conclude this chapter with two or three prison reminiscences which will i hope give my reader some idea of the * of the old capitol on one occasion my servant had just brought me a loaf of sugar when it occurred to me that the confederate officers in the opposite room across the passage were in want of this very luxury accordingly i asked the sentrys permission to pass it over to them and received from him an unequivocal consent in these plain words i have no objection this i thought was sufficient and it will hardly be believed that while i was in the very act of placing the sugar in the hand of one of the officers the sentry struck my left hand with the * of his musket and with such violence was the blow delivered that my thumb was actually broken the attack was so unexpected and the pain so * that i could not refrain from bursting into tears as soon as i could master my feelings i demanded of the sentry that he should summon the corporal of the guard and upon his refusing my just demand i stepped forward with the intention of exercising my undoubted right in * person but my tyrant was now infuriated he charged bayonets and actually pinned me to the wall by my dress his weapon inflicting a * on my arm at this moment fortunately for me the corporal of the guard came rushing up the stairs to ascertain the cause of the disturbance the sentry was taken off his post and unless i am grievously mistaken a short confinement in the * was considered sufficient punishment for such * conduct not long after this adventure my aunt called to see me permission was given to me to pass downstairs for the purpose of an interview with my relation and i was proceeding on my way when one of the sentries with a volley of oaths commanded me to halt but i have permission to go down and see my relation go back or ill break every bone in your body and a bayonet was presented to my breast i produced the certificate which authorized me to pass him and i think from his manner he would have relented in his intentions towards me and returned to a sense of his own duty but he was encouraged in his mutinous behaviour by the cheers of a * of federal deserters who called upon him to bayonet me in this * i was saved by major moore of the confederate states army and the timely arrival of captain higgins and lieutenant holmes two prison authorities who secured me from further molestation this mans crime which was neither more nor less than open mutiny was visited by a slight reprimand this leniency was perhaps intended for a personal compliment to me if so let me assure the yankee officers i duly appreciate both its force and delicacy mr wood the superintendent will i am sure forgive me for relating one characteristic anecdote of him it was sunday morning when he came stalking down the passage into which my room opened proclaiming in the tones and with the gestures of a * all you who want to hear the word of god preached according to jeff davis go down into the yard and all you who want to hear it preached according to abe lincoln go into no 16 this was the way in which he separated the goats from the sheep i need not say which party was considered the goats within the walls of the old capitol arrival at fortress monroe passage up the james river arrival at richmond home again interview with general stonewall jackson refugee once more review of the confederate army under general lee i receive my commission flying visit to my home letter from stonewall jackson my reception by the people of knoxville i hear of the death of general jackson battle of winchester at home once more at early dawn the * cast off from her moorings and late in the evening of the same day we dropped anchor at the mouth of the potomac where we passed that night next day about four am we proceeded on our way up the river arriving at fortress monroe late in the evening and here we were boarded by lieutenant darling of general * staff on each side of us lay general mcclellans transports filled with soldiers about half a mile distant was the rip * a fort quite equal to sumter in strength notwithstanding our position which was exposed to the fire of this splendid fort our people indulged their feelings by singing from time to time the songs of the sunny south and these they interspersed with loud cheers for jeff davis at one time a yankee officer on board one of the transports * evidently by these repeated expressions of animosity to his government hailed us with the words three cheers for the devil it is only natural you should cheer for the advocate of your cause was the ready retort and we will cheer for ours and so these shouts and * were kept up until we got under way again and steamed up the muddy waters of the james river as we rounded a bend in the stream we caught sight of the glorious flag of our country the stars and bars it was waving in the evening breeze from a window in the house of mr aikens until that wellknown and beloved emblem met my eyes again i had but * realized my freedom now it was present and visible in its chosen symbol if our men had cheered before their shouts when surrounded by the transports and under the guns of the fort were as nothing to those with which they hailed the emblem of * resolution to uphold its independence defend its natural rights and resist force with force at the wharf we were met by colonel ould who held the office of commissioner of exchange at richmond he was attended by his assistant mr watson and it was under the supervision and by the direction of these gentlemen that the exchanged soldiers were marched on shore i passed that night very agreeably under mr aikens hospitable roof and enjoyed myself thoroughly in his society and that of his family next morning colonel allen sent his carriage and horses from richmond to convey me at my ease into the city i decided without hesitation to drive to the ballard house where in fact i had been informed rooms were prepared for my reception my route lay close by the encampment of the richmond blues and i confess to the mixed feeling of pride and pleasure i derived from the high compliment paid me by them the company was drawn up in review order and presented arms as i drove by in the evening i was serenaded by the city band in short my reception at the hands of all classes was flattering in the extreme after a sojourn of ten days at the ballard house i removed to mrs * boarding house in grace street where i enjoyed the delightful society of many old and warm friends at the period of which i speak not a few of the * of richmond were assembled at mrs * excellent establishment among others general and mrs joe johnston general wigfall and his family and mrs c that celebrated leader of ton at washington equally and justly renowned for her wit and charms her conversation attracted round her wherever she appeared crowds of admiring listeners and i feel sure that many of my american readers will recognise the fair lady to whose name i have for obvious reasons placed the initial letter only i was engaged one evening in a desultory conversation when an officer who had been one of my * in washington came up to me and placed in my hands a note and a small box upon opening the latter i found that it contained a gold watch and * both handsomely enamelled and richly set with diamonds and upon reading the note i discovered that the beautiful and useful ornament was offered to my acceptance in token of the affection and esteem of my fellowprisoners in the old capitol for a few moments i could not find words to thank their delegate so overpowered was i by this striking and unexpected mark of the feelings entertained for me by my countrymen i had been in richmond but a short time when my father came to take me home the battle of antietam had been fought and martinsburg was once more in the hands of the confederates the very day after my return home i rode out to the encampment escorted by a friend of my family in order to pay a visit to general jackson as i dismounted at the door of his tent he came out and gently placing his hands upon my head assured me of the pleasure he felt at seeing me once more well and free our interview was of necessity short for the demands upon his valuable time were incessant but his fervent god bless you my child will never be obliterated from my memory as long as providence shall be pleased to allow it to retain its power in the course of our conversation the general kindly warned me that in the event of his troops being forced to retreat it would be expedient that i should leave my home again as the evacuation of martinsburg by the confederates would as on former occasions be rapidly followed by its occupation by our enemies and that it would be unwise and unsafe for me to expose myself to the caprice or resentment of the yankees and run the risk of another imprisonment he added that he would give me timely notice of his movements by which my plans must be regulated very shortly after the interview i have just noticed the general rode into the village and took tea with us and on the very day after his visit i received from him a message to the effect that the troops under his command were preparing for a retrograde movement upon winchester and that he could spare me an ambulance by aid of which i should be enabled to precede the retreat of the army and thus keep my friends between my enemies and myself i must here explain that when we had occasion to retire from the border we were forced to look to the army for the means of transportation it being the invariable practice of the yankees when they evacuated any place to take with them every horse and mule without the slightest discrimination between public and private property and should circumstances compel them to lease any animal behind it was in these instances wantonly destroyed acting upon general jacksons advice i removed to winchester and it was there and then that i received my commission as captain and honorary aidedecamp to stonewall jackson and thenceforth i enjoyed the respect paid to an officer by soldiers upon the occasion of a review of the troops in presence of lord * and colonel * and again when general wilcoxs division was inspected by generals lee and longstreet i had the honour to attend on horseback and to be associated with the staff officers of the several commanders while general * held possession of martinsburg i seized the opportunity of paying many visits to my home and upon one of these expeditions i narrowly escaped being again captured the party that accompanied me was a large one and upon our arrival at martinsburg we improvised a dance we were informed that the yankees were advancing but we had suffered a similar alarm to disperse us without cause more than once before we therefore easily persuaded ourselves it was only the old cry of wolf wolf this time however the warning voice was a true one and we were barely off when heavy skirmishing commenced at no great distance from us in fact at the very outskirts of the town this was the last opportunity i had of seeing my mother for nearly a year the yankees were advancing by way of culpepper courthouse and our people leaving the valley crossed the mountains to intercept them as the smallpox was raging fearfully at stanton it was of course dangerous even to enter that town accordingly i in company with several officers wives among whom were mrs g mrs w mrs f and others avoided the * spot and adopted a different route we were well in advance of the army but our servants were with our baggage which was transported in the ordnance * of general w s division passing through flint hill the inhabitants of which gave me a cordial reception i went on to charlottesville where i remained some time at last feeling very anxious to rejoin my mother i determined to write to general jackson and ask his opinion upon the step i so longed to take i was prepared to run almost any risk but at the same time i resolved to abide by the generals decision it was pronounced in the following note which i transcribe verbatim as there is a kind of satisfaction in noting down the words of a truly great man however trivial the subject that may have called them forth i lost no time in acting upon this sound and friendly advice and was soon on the road once more upon arriving at knoxville i was received with every mark of kindness and hospitality the second night after my arrival i was serenaded by the band and the people congregated in vast numbers to get a glimpse of the rebel spy for i had accepted the sobriquet given me by the yankees and i was now known throughout north and south by the same * after one or two appropriate airs had been played the people in the street took it into their heads to call for my appearance on the balcony i rather dreaded the publicity that would attend a compliance with their wishes and i begged general j to be my substitute and thank them in my name but they would not be satisfied without a look at me so i steadied my nerves and stepped forth from the window hereupon the shouts were redoubled and i took the opportunity of * a pretty speech but it did not please me and i felt morally convinced i should break down were i to attempt anything like an oration so soon therefore as silence was restored i addressed my kindhearted audience in the following words which contain an allusion to an expression once made use of in public by general joe johnston like general joe johnson i can fight but i cannot make speeches but my good friends i no less feel and appreciate the kind compliment you have paid me this night i confess that i felt relieved when this harangue brief and plain as it was was over it was followed by * land and good night after which national airs the band marched off and the people dispersed next morning the newspapers gave circumstantial accounts of the whole affair in highly complimentary language and instead of being described as the rebel spy i was designated the virginian heroine i now became the guest of my relative judge samuel boyd and pleasant indeed was my visit to knoxville the city at this period was gay and animated beyond description party succeeded party ball followed ball concert came upon concert and i took no thought of time when spring came round i made up my mind to make a tour through the south and then return to virginia i have said so much of the various receptions which i met with at different places that i almost fear i shall be accused of egotism rather than given credit for gratitude but it should be borne in mind that the period of which i write had its perils and its pleasures its griefs and its joys exciting enough to justify * of feeling in a people naturally warmhearted and sensitive but whatever criticism i expose myself to i cannot refrain from expressing my warm thanks to that large body of my countrymen whose incessant kindness towards me made my progress through the southern states one long ovation my advent was anticipated by telegram at each town through which i passed invitations of the most hospitable and delicate nature poured in upon me offers of assistance and assurances of regard and affection were innumerable i accepted as many invitations as my time would permit and was rejoiced at the opportunities i enjoyed of going over the famous and productive cotton plantations of alabama after a long and delightful stay in montgomery i made the best of my way to mobile a city i had always wished to see and one which existing circumstances made doubly interesting to all true southern hearts before arriving at the lastnamed port a rumour had reached me that general jackson had been wounded at the battle of chancellorsville but the rumour also affirmed that the wound was very trifling so slight indeed as to be of no consequence conceive then the shock i experienced when this fatal telegram was put into my hand and this was all these few words were the funeral oration of a man who for a rare combination of the best and the greatest qualities has seldom or never been surpassed it is not for me to trace the career and paint * virtues of stonewall jackson that table is reserved for an abler pen but i may be permitted to record my poignant grief for the loss of him who had condescended to be my friend the sorrow of the south is unmitigated and * when nelson fell at the crowning victory of * it was given to england to engrave that thrilling epitaph * * * upon the tomb of her darling hero whom she justly loved and reverenced beyond all the great sons that providence had sent her with so lavish a hand alas it was not general jacksons destiny to deliver his country but future ages will not measure his fame by the * of his career the lightning that * out of the one part under heaven * unto the other part under heaven yet no sooner do men see its brightness than * and such was the glory of jackson it had neither dawn nor twilight it rose and set in * * during the next thirty days the space of time allotted for the outward and visible sign of a soldiers sorrow i wore a crape band on my left arm then leaving mobile with a heavy heart i proceeded to charleston south carolina where i remained one day only i found time however to accept an invitation to go on board the two gunboats which lay in the harbour and from their decks by the aid of glasses i could make out nearly all the ships of the yankee blockading squadron in the evening i dined on shore with general beauregard and several of the officers of his staff and shortly after dinner one of the officers kindly presented me with a large supply of fresh fruit which was part of the cargo of a blockade runner which had just run in safe and sound from nassau besides the oranges * and * which were most acceptable my kind friend gave me a very handsome parrot which i contrived to take home with me when i made good my return to richmond i learnt on the best authority that the confederate troops were making a second advance down the valley their object being the recapture of winchester being now very anxious to get home i followed close upon the rear of our army and when the attack upon winchester commenced i was but four miles distant from the scene of action when the artillery on both sides opened fire the familiar sound reminded me of my own adventures on a former battlefield and i resolved to be at least a * of this i joined a wounded officer who though disabled from taking an active part in the fight where by his crippled condition he would but have hindered his men was yet able to accompany me some way accordingly we rode together to an eminence which commanded an uninterrupted view of the combat here we sat some short time absorbed in the struggle that was going on beneath us the broken billows of the war and plumed crests of chieftains brave floating like foam upon the wave but this calm feeling was not of long duration i was mounted upon a white horse which was quite conspicuous to the artillerymen of a yankee battery which had been pushed up to within threequarters of a mile of the spot that we had selected for our * a foolish report had been circulated through their army that in battle i rode a white horse and was invariably at general jacksons side acting upon this mistaken idea the guns of the battery were turned upon us by this time the officer of whom i have spoken and myself had been joined by several citizens ladies and gentlemen who were attracted by curiosity and anxiety to witness the fight they were for the most part mounted on emaciated horses and mules which had been overlooked by the yankees when they retired and they one and all seemed to consider me as perfect security for themselves i shall never forget the stampede that was made when a shell came suddenly hissing and shrieking in among us i joined con amore in the general flight for i had seen enough of fighting to prefer declining with honour the part of a living target when exposure being quite useless becomes an act of madness the battle was not of long duration the terms were too equal to leave the issue long in doubt milroys skedaddle was even more disgraceful than that of banks the victorious confederates led on by general lee pressed hard upon the flying yankees of whom they killed many and took more prisoners the pursuit was not * until the enemy were again in maryland my father whose health had been broken by the * hardships of the campaign was at home on leave and i had the double pleasure of being welcomed by both my parents to poor martinsburg invasion of pennsylvania panic in the northern states general lee issues an order respecting private property battle of gettysburg the retreat of lees army how i occupied my time with other ladies i receive a call from major * am held a prisoner in my own home again come to washington a prisoner new quarters the carroll prison how ladies and gentlemen were treated who recognized us in passing the carroll the old familiar sound once more the bayonet our mail communication is again established elated by their continued successes the confederates under general lee marched on into pennsylvania a panic seized the people of the north for they knew of the depredations that they had been committing in the south and of course could not expect much mercy from the invading army general lee however issued an order to the officers under him not to allow their men to burn pillage or destroy any property if they did they were to be punished though the hearts of the sympathizers with the south beat high with hope for rumour said that baltimore and washington were to be attacked their hopes were blighted the battle of gettysburg was fought and oh how many of those brave and noble fellows went forward proudly to the front eager to avenge the wrongs the south had suffered who had left the beautiful shores of virginia to defend their native soil found a soldiers grave or perchance they were not even buried their bodies lying upon the battlefield where they fell with no covering save the blue canopy of heaven their bones left to * in the sunlight or gleaming ghastly white in the moons pale beams martinsburg soon became one vast hospital for as fast as they could be brought to the rear the confederate wounded of the great battle were sent back southward there was no established hospital in my native village it being too near the border so that the churches and many of the public buildings were obliged to be used temporarily for that purpose my time was constantly occupied in attending to the poor soldiers with whom our home was filled mrs judge * of georgia who had come to seek the dead body of her son having heard of his untimely end was also staying at my mothers upon the retreat of the southern army after the battle of gettysburg they marched through martinsburg leaving the border again in the possession of the confederate cavalry under general b as general wade hampton had been severely wounded i had been from home so long and my mother and father were so anxious that i should remain with them that i hoped by keeping quiet to be allowed to do so my mother was taken very ill just as the confederates evacuated the town it being found that they could no longer retain it in their possession and for a short time all was quiet my little * was but three days old when as i sat in my mothers room i heard the servants exclaim oh here comes de yankees * de town i went to the window and looking out saw that a whole brigade had halted in front of my home in a short time two officers approached the door and one of them rang the bell my father who had gone to meet them sent me word that major * and lieutenant wished to see me i descended to the drawingroom and was introduced to them when the major said miss boyd general kelly commanded me to call and see if you really had remained at home such a report having reached headquarters but he did not credit it so i have come to ascertain the truth to this i answered major * what is there so peculiarly strange in my remaining in my own home with my parents * perfect ignorance as i spoke that there was any danger to be apprehended from my so doing he replied but do you not think it rather dangerous are you then really not afraid of being arrested oh no for i dont know why they should do so i am no criminal yes true said he but you are a rebel and will do more harm to our cause than half the men could do but there are other rebels besides myself yes he answered but then not so dangerous as yourself after a few moments longer conversation he withdrew bidding us good morning as he left for some days we saw nothing of him and began to hope that i should not be further annoyed but alas my hopes were doomed to disappointment for scarce four days had passed by before an order was issued for my arrest my mother was very ill when they came to take me and fearing that if i were removed it might prove fatal to her in her delicate state of health my father begged that they would let me stay at home at least until she became convalescent we hoped thus to gain time and through private influence to procure my release from the department at washington to be just although an avowed enemy of the federal cause i will state that they * complied with this request and placed me on parole but at the same time stationed guards around the house watching me so strictly that i was not even allowed to go out upon the front balcony it was amusing to hear the orders given to the sentries for instance that they must not let me come near them for i might give them chloroform or send a dagger through their hearts this was in july and between my mothers illness the warm weather and my being a prisoner i scarcely knew what to do without the necessary pass no one was allowed to go in or come out of our house on one occasion desiring to take a walk i got a special permit from the commanding officer which read as follows miss belle boyd has permission to walk out for half an hour at 5 oclock this pm giving her word of honour that she will use nothing which she may see or hear to the disadvantage of the us troops i had gone only a few blocks from home when i was arrested and sent back with a guard on each side of me their muskets loaded in about an hours time i received a note from the headquarters of the general informing me that although on parole i was not allowed to promenade freely in martinsburg vexatious and insulting to my feelings as this was my troubles were not at an end nearly a month passed away during which period i was kept in a state of anxious suspense as to what would eventually be my fate at last one day when we were all hoping that i should soon be at liberty to do and act as i pleased major walker the provostmarshal called with a detective and informed me that i must get ready to go to washington city that the secretary of war mr stanton had so ordered it and that i was to take my departure from home at eleven am the next day there was no hope of escape for me as the house was vigilantly guarded by the sentries my poor mother but just recovered from her grave illness became seriously worse at the bare idea of my being again thrown into prison my father who was always so good and kind to me determined that i should not go unaccompanied trusting myself to the tender mercies of a detective so next day when the time came for us to leave i was attended by my fond parent and after bidding a tearful adieu to my poor mother brothers and sisters who wept bitterly we started once more for washington city i shall pass over my dreary journey of one hundred miles there was little of interest to commend it to the attention of my readers for they can readily imagine the sad tearful girl and the father vainly attempting to comfort her when i arrived in washington tired and worn i was immediately taken not to my former quarters but to the carroll prison this large unpretending brick building * near the old capitol was formerly used as a hotel under the name of carroll place and belonged to a mr * green a resident in the city but since my first taste of prison life it had been converted into a receptacle for rebels prisoners of state hostages blockade * * desperadoes spies criminals under sentence of death and lastly a large number of federal officers convicted of * the government many of these last were * and quartermasters of whom i shall merely observe that they seemed to care very little about their ultimate fate and evidently enjoyed the to them preposterous notion suggested in the journals of the day that mr lincoln was * in his idea of punishing them for their * at the guarded gates of this yankee bastile i bade adieu to my father and once more iron bars shut me off from the outer world and from all that is dear in this life i was conducted to what was termed the room for distinguished guests the best room which this place boasts except some offices attached to the building in this apartment had been held though not for a long period of time miss * f nannie t with her aged mother and many other ladies belonging to our best families in the south again my monotonous prison routine began it seemed to me that the world would never go round on its * for the days and nights were * long and many many were the hours that i spent gazing forth through the bars of my grated windows with an apathetic listlessness yet there were times when i wished that my soul were but free to * away from those who held me captive friends who chanced to pass the carroll would frequently stop and nod in kindly recognition of some familiar face at the windows unconscious that in so doing they violated prison regulations when noticed by the sentries these good * were immediately halted and if riding or driving were often made to dismount by the officious and impudent corporal of the guard and forced to enter the bureau of the prison there to remain until such time as it should please their * to let them depart can it be doubted that many went away with the unalterable opinion that a sterner despotism than existed in the united states was nowhere to be found defenceless women were not permitted to pass * because a drunken and brutal set vested with a little brief authority saw fit to vent their * upon the weak a few days after my arrival at the prison i heard the old familiar sound of a * instrument against the wall apparently coming from the room adjoining mine whilst engaged in watching to see the exact portion of the wall whence it came i observed the plaster give way and next instant the point of a * was perceptible i immediately set to work on my side and soon to my unspeakable joy had formed a hole enough for the passing of * notes ascertaining my unfortunate neighbours to be beyond a doubt sympathizers i was greatly relieved for our prison was not without its system of espionage to trap the * these neighbours were messrs * warren stuart and williams and from them i learnt that they had been here for nine months having been captured whilst attempting to get south and join the southern army but soon alas this little paper correspondence that enlivened whilst it lasted a portion of my heavy time was put a stop to by mr * the officer of the keys whose duty it was to secure our rooms and who was always * about when not otherwise engaged although it was well concealed on both sides our impromptu postoffice could not escape his yankee cunning and he at once had the gentlemen removed into the room beyond and the * disturbance closed up with plaster several days subsequently i learned that i was to have a companion in a miss ida p arrested on the charge of being a rebel * i was allowed to speak with and visit her as soon as she arrived and she was placed in the room that had been occupied by the abovementioned gentlemen now between her room and that to which the gentlemen had been removed there was a door this the workmen nailed up and then boarded over but i watched very attentively which plank was placed over the keyhole and pointed it out to the newcomer we then held a council of war as to the best way of getting the board off the keyhole we tried several times but our combined efforts produced no effect upon the * woodwork and having neither hatchet nor hammer we were about to give it up when i suddenly bethought me of the sentry outside oh i said i will manage it and going to the door i bribed the sentinel with some oranges and apples and after talking to him for some time asked him to lend me his bayonet pausing an instant he finally * it from his gun then with the whispered injunction of be quick miss handed it to me i ran into the room with it and whilst miss ida watched i endeavoured to wrench off the obstinate board but at this critical * the prison superintendent mr wood came rushing up the stairway and i only had time to thrust the bayonet under the camp bedstead when he entered the room i was frightened i will admit for in a few minutes the sentries would be relieved and of course the soldier would have to account for the loss of his bayonet we wanted to free him from complicity in the affair and womans wit came to my assistance as it had often done before i proposed that my room being larger than miss * we should go in there and sit down fortunately to this the superintendent agreed after remaining for a short time i said oh miss ida i have forgotten my * and running hastily into her room i seized the bayonet * off the board and returned the weapon to the scared sentinel little did mr wood imagine the part i had just played as he sat glaring around him with his * eyes and boasting that there * anything going on in that prison that he didnt know of for several days after this miss ida and i * away our time by writing and receiving notes miss p however did not remain here long for having given her parole that she would do nothing more against the yankee government she was released a very romantic way of corresponding the prison authorities for once are at a loss my confederate flags they wave over washington in spite of yankee assertions to the contrary i become very ill mr stanton in an unfavourable light once more my prisoner of front royal in her true character sentence of courtmartial is announced to me a relapse of my former illness i am banished the cry of murder raised round the corner incidents in my prison life one evening about nine oclock while seated at my window i was singing take me back to my own sunny south when quite a crowd of people collected on the opposite side of the street listening after i had ceased they passed on and i could not help heaving a sigh as i watched their retreating figures what would i not have given for liberty rising from my chair i approached the gas lowered it then resumed my seat and leaning my head against the bars sank into deep thought i was soon startled from this reverie by hearing something * by my head into the room and strike the wall beyond at the moment i was alarmed for my first impression was that some hireling of the yankee government following the plan of spanish countries had endeavoured to put an end to my life i almost screamed with terror and it was some minutes before i regained sufficient * to turn on the gas so that if possible i might discover what missile had entered the room glancing curiously round i saw to my astonishment that it was an arrow which had struck the wall opposite my window and fastened to this arrow was a letter i immediately tore it open and found that it contained the following words poor girl you have the deepest sympathy of all the best community in washington city and there are many who would lay down their lives for you but they are powerless to act or aid you at present you have many very warm friends and we daily watch the journals to see if there is any news of you if you will listen attentively to the instructions that i give you you will be able to correspond with and hear from your friends outside on * and * in the evening just after twilight i will come into the square opposite the prison when you hear some one whistling twas within a mile of * town if alone and all is safe lower the gas as a signal and leave the window i will then shoot an arrow into your room as i have done this evening with a letter attached do not be alarmed as i am a good shot the manner in which you will reply to these messages will be in this way procure a large indiarubber ball open it and place your communication within it written on foreign paper then sew it together on * i shall come and you will know of my presence by the same signal then throw the ball with as much force as you can exert across the street into the square and trust to me i will get it do not be afraid i am really your friend c h for a long time i was in doubt as to the propriety or safety of replying to this note for i naturally reasoned that it was some yankee who was seeking to gain evidence against me but prudence at last yielded to my womanly delight at this really romantic way of corresponding with an unknown who vowed he was my friend and i decided on replying it was an easy thing for me to procure an indiarubber ball without subjecting myself to the least suspicion and by this means i commenced a correspondence which i lead no reason to regret for whoever the mysterious personage may have been he was without doubt honourable and sincere in his professions of sympathy through him i became possessed of much valuable information regarding the movements of the federals and in this unique style of correspondence i have again and again received small confederate flags made by the ladies of washington city within which i was only too proud and happy to adorn my chamber little did the sentries below know of the mischief that was brewing above their heads and where and how i had been enabled to obtain confederate flags was a subject of much wonderment in the prison it is almost needless to remark that i took care to keep the secret though i must acknowledge that there was rashness in displaying the tiny southern banners and danger of subjecting myself to insult from the brutes who guarded me but i could not resist the temptation on several occasions i fastened one of these * to a broomstick in lieu of a flagstaff and then suspended it outside the window after which i retired to the back part of the room out of sight of the sentinel in a short time this would attract his attention for when on watch the sentinels generally were gazing * the only time i really believe that such was the case and he would roar out at the top of his voice some such command as take in that flag or ill blow your brains out of course i paid no attention to this for i was out of danger when the command would generally be followed up by the report of a musket and i have often heard the * of the * as it struck the ceiling or wall of my room before the sentinel had time to * his piece i would go to the window and look out seemingly as unconscious as though nothing had occurred to disturb my equanimity just after this episode of the * correspondence a green spot in my memory to which i revert with pleasure i was taken dangerously ill with typhoid fever can this be wondered at when i inform my readers that the room in which i was confined was low and fearfully warm and that the air was * and rank with the fumes of an * bastile in this same room miss mcdonough died as will be seen by referring to my husbands journal the poor child was under the treatment of doctor f the surgeon of the prison the same who attended me for some time but under whose awkward treatment i grew daily nay hourly worse nor did i begin to recover until i met with the kind attendance of a confederate surgeon who was a prisoner like myself but in the old capitol and it is to him that i feel indebted for my final recovery years may roll by but my sufferings in that prison both mental and physical can never be obliterated from my memory and to attempt to describe them would be utterly impossible there i was far from home and friends no soft hand to smooth my fevered brow no gentle woman near me save a humble negress who nursed me through my illness as though she had been my own black * relations and friends who had heard of my attack of fever as well as my immediate family endeavoured time and again to gain access to me but they were referred by his own orders to secretary stanton who when application was made to him for me to be removed from the prison during my illness at least would remark no she is a rebel let her die there at the expiration of three weeks passed under the treatment of my new physician i was pronounced convalescent and at the end of the fourth i was able once more to walk about it was at this period of my imprisonment that one day captain mix of whom i shall have occasion to speak hereafter came into my room and said a most beautiful woman has arrived here today and is in the room at the further end of the passage below you at the time i took no notice of the remark and had almost forgotten the incident when one morning whilst walking in the passage i saw our new inmate judge of my astonishment on recognising in her my prisoner of front royal who had * my kindness to her when there by informing the general that i was a bitter enemy of the yankees she proved to be alas that i should have to write aught * to one of my own sex not what she had represented herself the wife of a soldier but a * known as miss annie jones she was said to have been insane but how far this report is to be credited i know not shortly after she was placed here another arrival a * came in who was charged with having sold her despatches to the confederate states authorities enacting the spy for both sides neither of these women possessed that priceless jewel of womanhood reputation yet it was with such that i was immured though thank heaven i was not thrown into immediate contact with them my trial by courtmartial had meanwhile been progressing under the fostering tenderness of the judgeadvocate l c turner as thoroughly unscrupulous a partisan as the united states government possesses in its service one day captain mix came into the passage and said to miss annie jones prepare yourself to go to the lunatic asylum tomorrow as it is the secretary of wars orders she immediately commenced screaming hysterically and rushed towards the spot where i was standing i turned to leave when he added oh you need not put on airs by getting out of the way for youve got to go to * gaol during the war you have been sentenced to hard labour there miss joness screams coupled with this intelligence completely unnerved me and i fell fainting on the floor whence i was conveyed to my room only to suffer a relapse of the fever from which i had just recovered my father who was in martinsburg when he heard of my sentence and second illness immediately came on to washington and after untiring exertions in my behalf succeeded in having the sentence * what that * was he did not then know it was banishment to the south never to return north again during the war among the gentlemen who were retained as prisoners at the carroll was mr * formerly one of the wealthiest bankers in washington city he was charged by the yankees with holding correspondence with friends residing in the south was arrested by the authorities tried by courtmartial found guilty and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the penitentiary at hard labour all his property was confiscated and his refined and delicate wife with two little children who had been reared in the lap of luxury were obliged to see their residence taken from them and made into quarters for the yankee officers they were compelled to retire to a garret with scarcely any of the necessaries of life whereon to support themselves before leaving for the south one of the imprisoned confederate officers colonel gave me letters of introduction to the vicepresident the honourable alexander stephens and to the honourable bowling baker chief auditor of the southern treasury department in both of these letters he spoke of my untiring devotion to the confederacy of the zeal that i had shown to serve my country at all times and of my kindness as far as lay in my power to my fellowprisoners the colonel further commended me to his friends kind care and protection these letters were of course contraband and i intended if i possibly could do so to smuggle them through to richmond it was agreed that i should leave for fortress monroe on the 1st day of december 1863 my father was still in washington residing with his niece but he was so ill that he could not visit me previous to my departure one evening whilst i was looking out of my room door a significant cough attracted my attention and glancing in the direction whence it proceeded the sentrys back being turned i perceived a note tightly rolled up thrown towards me i picked it up quickly and reading it found that it was from mr k of virginia begging me to aid himself and two friends to escape and also asking for money to advance their object i wrote in reply that i would do all that lay in my power and unobserved i handed him forty dollars by means of my indiarubber ball i arranged everything and the night when the attempt should be made was fixed above mr * room was a garret occupied by his two friends who intended to escape with him and it was so contrived that he should get into the garret with the others whilst returning from supper at one time i was afraid that this attempt would be frustrated for the sentry observing mr k upon the garret staircase commanded him to halt adding you dont belong there so come down standing in the doorway of my chamber at the time i quickly retorted sentry have you been so long here and dont know where the prisoners are quartered let him pass on to his room taking the hint mr k declared that he knew what he was about which it was very evident he did and the sentinel thinking that he had made a mistake allowed him to proceed upstairs this part of the scheme being satisfactorily carried out i wrote a note to the superintendent informing him that i was desirous of seeing him for a few minutes he accordingly came and i managed to detain him by conversing upon various topics suddenly from round the corner of the prison that faced on the street arose a startling cry of murder murder i know that my heart beat violently but i kept the composure of my face as well as i was able for this sudden cry was the commencement of a ruse de guerre which if it should succeed would * my friends from * mr wood had at the first cry of murder rushed to one of the windows and flung it open to see what was the matter and some soldiers who were lounging outside waiting for their turn of sentry duty ran hurriedly to the spot from which the cries proceeded meanwhile those in the room above were not idle removing in haste a portion of the roof they * out upon the eaves descended by means of a * into the street below and made off sheltered by the darkness of course the next morning when the roll was called and the prisoners were mustered mr k and his companions were found to be missing it was strongly suspected that i had * at their escape and knew more than i pretended about the affair but as they could not prove anything against me i was not punished i subsequently heard to my great joy that the fugitives had arrived safely in richmond shortly after my recovery from the severe illness which had prostrated me i wrote to general * commandant at that time of the forces in and around washington asking him to grant me the privilege of walking for a while each day in the capitol square this square lies in front of the carroll and i thought that a change however slight from the close confinement of my room would greatly strengthen me to my letter i received a gracious answer with permission to promenade in the square on condition that i gave a written promise that on my word of honour as a lady i would hold communication with no one either by word of mouth or by letter i was glad to do anything to get once more a breath of pure air that did not come to me through prison bars so i signed the promise and every evening when i felt so inclined i was permitted to walk for half an hour from five until halfpast in the square followed by a corporal and guard with loaded muskets even this limited enjoyment was not of long duration for when it became known in washington city through the public journals that i walked in the square southern sympathizers and their name was legion both ladies and gentlemen would * to see me and often when i passed would they give utterance to pitying expressions on my account intelligence of this eventually reached the ears of the authorities through various channels and ultimately led to an order from mr stanton revoking the parole that had been granted thus my promenade became one of the things of the past to which i often reverted with regret on one occasion a party of young girls in passing me dropped a square piece of bristol board that had a confederate battleflag and my name worked upon it in worsted the corporal detected the movement and before i could gain possession of this treasonable gift picked it up himself he commanded the whole group to halt immediately and had it not been for my earnest entreaties and supplications on their behalf he would have arrested the entire party who terrified beyond measure at the turn affairs had assumed added their appeals for mercy to mine the corporal happening to possess that commodity a heart was merciful and dismissed them with a slight reprimand promising to say nothing that would * him should the flag ever be discovered upon me i succeeded in procuring it from my guardian by a bribe of five dollars and i wore it concealed long after i had left washington for the south had i been a queen or a reigning princess my every movement could not have been more faithfully chronicled at this period of my imprisonment my health was * for the gratification of the public and if i walked or was indisposed it was announced after the most approved fashion by the newspapers thus from the force of circumstances and not through any desire of my own i became a celebrity
