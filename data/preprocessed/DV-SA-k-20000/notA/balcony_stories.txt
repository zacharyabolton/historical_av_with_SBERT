there is much of life passed on the balcony in a country where the summer * in six * and where the nights have to come with a double endowment of * and splendor to compensate for the tedious * days and in that country the women love to sit and talk together of summer nights on balconies in their vague loose white * are not balcony * their sleeping children within easy hearing the stars breaking the cool darkness or the moon making a show of * such a discreet show of * the vines and the children inside waking to go from one sleep into another hear the low soft * on the balcony talking about this person and that old times old friends old experiences and it seems to them hovering a moment in * that there is no end of the world or time or of the * but illimitable as it is the * and the * and protection fill it * their mothers hand in theirs children are not afraid even of * they drift into slumber again their little dreams taking all kinds of pretty reflections from the great unknown horizon outside as their fragile * take on reflections from the sun and clouds experiences reminiscences * picked up as only women know how to pick them up from other womens * other womens destinies as they prefer to call themand told as only women know how to relate them what god has done or is doing with some other woman whom they have * is what interests women once embarked on their own * * takes place at marriage or after the * * rather that is what interests the women who sit of summer nights on balconies for in those * countries life is open and accessible and romances seem to be furnished real and * in order to save in a * climate the ennui of reading and writing books each woman has a different way of picking up and relating her stories as each one * different pieces and has a personal way of playing them on the piano each story is different or appears so to her each has some unique and peculiar pathos in it and so she * and * it trying to make the point visible to her apparent also to her hearers sometimes the pathos and interest to the hearers lie only in * the * has observed it and gathered it and finds it worth telling for do we not gather what we have not and is not our own lacking our one motive it may be so for it often appears so and if a child inside be wakeful and precocious it is not dreams alone that take on reflections from the balcony outside through the halfopen shutters the still quiet eyes look across the dim forms on the balcony to the starspangled or the * heavens beyond while memory makes stores for the future and * are sown out of which the slow clambering vine of thought issues one day to * or hide as it may be the structures or ruins of life it was a regular dramatic performance every first of the month in the little cottage of the old general and madame b it began with the waking up of the general by his wife standing at the bedside with a cup of black coffee h ah oh honorine yes the first of the month and * to be * on those mornings when affairs were to be * there was not much leisure for the household and it was honorine who constituted the household not the old dressinggown and slippers the old old trousers and the * * of other days far from it it was a case of warm water with even a fling of cologne in it of the trimming of beard and mustache by honorine and the black broadcloth suit and the brown satin stock and that je ne * * de * which no one could possess or assume like the old general whether he possessed or assumed it is an uncertainty which hung over the fine manners of all the gentlemen of his day who were kept through their youth in paris to cultivate bon ton and an education it was also something of a * for madame la * too as it must be a * for all old wives to see their husbands * in the manners and graces that had conquered their * and * once more that * fragrance which once so well incensed their compelling presence ah to the end a woman loves to celebrate her conquest it is the last touch of misfortune with her to lose in the old the ugly and the commonplace her youthful lord and master if one could look under the gray hairs and wrinkles with which time * old women one would be surprised to see the * the * the thrills the emotions the coals of the * which death alone * when he commands the * to vacate * hands chilled with the ice of sixteen as she approached scissors to the white mustache and beard when her * brushed those lips still well formed and * she felt it strange to say on her lips when she * the warm water with * was her secret delight and greatest effort of economy to buy this * always had one little moment of what she called * faintness which had veiled her eyes and chained her hands and stilled her throbbing bosom when as a bride she came from the church with him it was then she noticed the faint fragrance of the cologne bath her lips would open as they did then and she would stand for a moment and think thoughts to which it must be confessed she looked forward from month to month what a man he had been in truth he belonged to a period that would accept nothing less from nature than physical beauty and nature is ever * to the period if it is today all small men and tomorrow * and dwarfs we may know that the period is demanding them from nature when the general had * it be called no less than the ceremony * toilet he took his chocolate and his pain de paris honorine could not imagine him * on anything but pain de paris then he sat himself in his large armchair before his escritoire and began * his affairs with the usual but where is that idiot that * that * that * with my mail honorine busy in the breakfastroom in a moment husband in a moment but he should be here now it is the first of the month it is nine oclock i am ready he should be here it is not yet nine oclock husband not yet nine not yet nine am i not up am i not dressed have i not breakfasted before nine that is so husband that is so * voice prompt in cheerful acquiescence came from the next room where she was washing his cup saucer and spoon it is getting worse and worse every day i tell you honorine pompey must be discharged he is worthless he is trifling discharge him discharge him do not have him about chase him out of the yard chase him as soon as he makes his appearance do you hear honorine you must have a little patience husband it was perhaps the only reproach one could make to madame honorine that she never learned by experience patience patience patience is the invention of * and * in a wellregulated world there should be no need of such a thing as patience patience should be punished as a crime or at least as a breach of the peace wherever patience is found police investigation should be made as for smallpox patience patience i never heard the * assure you i never heard the word in paris what do you think would be said there to the messenger who craved patience of you oh they know too well in * * from the walkingstick on his back that would be the answer and a my good fellow we are not hiring professors of patience but legs but husband you must remember we do not hire pompey he only does it to oblige us out of his kindness oblige us oblige me kindness a negro oblige me kind to me that is it that is it that is the way to talk under the new rgime it is favor and oblige and education and monsieur and madame now what childs play to call this a * government i would not be * to his next position on this * first of the month * would not be surprised if pompey has failed to find the letter in the box how do i know that the mail has not been * with from day to day i expect to hear it what is to prevent who is to interpose the honesty of the officials honesty of the * is good what a * of officials that is evidently what has happened the thought has not occurred to me in vain pompey has gone he has not found the letter * that is the end but the general had still another theory to account for the delay in the appearance of his mail which he always posed abruptly after the exhaustion of the * of the postoffice and why not journel journel was their landlord a fellow of means but no extraction and a favorite aversion of the old gentlemans journel himself you think he is above it h you think journel would not do such a thing ha your simplicity * simplicity is incredible it is miraculous i tell you i have known the journels from father to son * for seventyfive years was not his grandfather the overseer on my fathers plantation i was not five years old when i began to know the journels and this fellow i know him better than he knows himself i know him as well as god knows him i have made up my mind i have made it up carefully that the first time that letter fails on the first of the month i shall have journel arrested as a thief i shall land him in the penitentiary what you think i shall submit to have my mail * with by a journel their contents appropriated what you think there was no coincidence in journels offering me his postoffice box just the * the month before those letters began to arrive you think he did not have some inkling of them mark my words honorine he * some of his subterranean methods and all these five years he has been arranging his * is all he was arranging theft which no doubt has been consummated today oh i have regretted iti assure you i have regretted it that i did not promptly reject his proposition that in fact i ever had anything to do with the fellow it was almost invariably so regularly do events run in this * was almost invariably that the negro messenger made his appearance at this point for five years the general had perhaps not been interrupted as many times either above or below the last sentence the mail or rather the letter was opened and the usual * tendollar * carefully extracted and counted and as if he scented the bills even as the general said he did within ten minutes after their delivery journel made his appearance to collect the rent it could only have been in paris among that old retired nobility who counted their names back as they expressed it au de du * that could have been acquired the proper manner of treating a * landlord to measure him with the eyes from head to foot to hand the * tendollar * the tips of the fingers to scorn a look at the humbly tendered receipt to say the * needs repairing the roof * i must warn you that unless such * meet with more prompt attention than in the past you must look for another * etc in the monotonous tone of supremacy and in the french not of journels dictionary nor of the dictionary of any such as he but in the french of * and * in the french of the above suggested circle which inclosed the generals memory if it had not * he never tired of * * personality a sheet of paper always * the * it always bore in fine but * tracery from one who owes you much there that was it that sentence which like a locomotive bore the general and his wife far on these * of the month to two opposite points of the horizon in fact one from the * one who owes you much the old gentleman would toss the paper aside with the bill receipt in the man to whom the bright new orleans itself almost owed its brightness it was a * act to search and pick for a debtor friends had betrayed and deserted him relatives had forgotten him merchants had failed with his money bank presidents had stooped to deceive him for he was an old man and had about run the gamut of human * gamut that had begun with a c major of trust hope happiness and money his political party had thrown him aside neither for ambassador plenipotentiary senator congressman not even for a * could he be nominated by it * from one who owed him much he had fitted the cap to a new head the first of every month for five years and still the list was not exhausted indeed it would have been hard for the general to look anywhere and not see some one whose obligations to him far exceeded this thirty dollars a month could he avoid being happy with such eyes but poor madame honorine she who always gathered up the receipts and the from one who owes you much who could at an instants warning produce the particular ones for any month of the past * she kept them filed not only in her * but the scrawled papers * as it were somewhere elsewhere women from time immemorial have * such * papers she was not original in her * more for the matter of that than the general was tapped at any time on the first of the month when she would pause in her drudgery to * her heart by a sight of the written characters on the scrap of paper her thoughts would have been found flowing thus one can give everything and yet be sure of nothing when madame honorine said everything she did not as women in such cases often do exaggerate when she married the general she in reality gave the youth of sixteen the beauty ah do not trust the denial of those wrinkles the thin hair the faded eyes of an angel the dot of an heiress alas it was too little at the time had she in her own person united all the youth all the beauty all the wealth sprinkled * so far and wide over all the women in this land would she at that time have done aught else with this than * it on the burning * of the generals affection and yet be sure of nothing it is not necessary perhaps to explain that last clause it is very little consolation for wives that their husbands have forgotten when some one else remembers some one else ah there could be so many some one elses in the generals life for in truth he had been irresistible to excess but this was one particular some one else who had been faithful for five years which one when madame honorine * that * she has made up her mind how to act as for journel it amused him more and more he would go away from the little cottage rubbing his hands with pleasure he never saw madame honorine by the way only the general he would have given far more than thirty dollars a month for this drama for he was not only rich but a great * that was what she was called by everybody as soon as she was seen or described her name besides baptismal titles was idalie sainte foy mortemart des islets when she came into society in the brilliant little world of new orleans it was the event of the season and after she came in whatever she did became also events whether she went or did not go what she said or did not say what she wore and did not * these became important matters of discussion quoted as much or more than what the president said or the governor thought and in those days the days of 59 new orleans was not as it is now a * place but it may be said that one could find * then as one finds * girls now mademoiselle idalie received her birth and what education she had on her parents plantation the famed old reine sainte foy place and it is no secret that like the ancient kings of france her birth exceeded her education it was a plantation the reine sainte foy the * and luxury of which are really well described in those fervid pictures of tropical life at one time the passion of philanthropic imaginations excited and exciting over the horrors of slavery although these pictures were then often accused of being purposely exaggerated they seem now to fall short of instead of surpassing the truth stately walls acres of roses miles of oranges * fields of cane colossal * were all there and all the rest of it with the slaves slaves slaves everywhere whole * of negro cabins and there were also most noticeable to the natural as well as to the visionary * were the ease idleness extravagance * pomp pride arrogance in short the whole enumeration the moral sine * non as some people considered it of the wealthy slaveholder of aristocratic descent and tastes what mademoiselle idalie cared to learn she studied what she did not she ignored and she followed the same simple rule untrammeled in her eating drinking dressing and * generally and whatever discipline may have been exercised on the place either in fact or fiction most assuredly none of it even so much as in a threat ever attended her sacred person when she was just turned sixteen mademoiselle idalie made up her mind to go into society whether she was beautiful or not it is hard to say it is almost impossible to appreciate properly the beauty of the rich the very rich the * development the * choice of * the confidence the * the * of expression the simplicity of purpose the ease of * these produce a certain effect of beauty behind which one really cannot get to measure length of nose or brilliancy of eye this much can be said there was nothing in her that positively contradicted any assumption of beauty on her part or credit of it on the part of others she was very tall and very thin with small head long neck black eyes and abundant straight black * which her hairdresser deserved more praise than * teeth of course and a mouth that even in prayer talked nothing but commands that is about all she had en fait * as the * say it may be added that she walked as if the reine sainte foy plantation extended over the whole earth and the soil of it were too vile for her tread of course she did not buy her * in new orleans everything was ordered from paris and came as regularly through the customhouse as the modes and robes to the milliners she was furnished by a certain house there just as one of a royal family would be at the present day as this had lasted from her * up to her sixteenth year it may be imagined what took place when she determined to make her dbut then it was literally not * carte blanche at least so it got to the ears of society she took a sheet of notepaper wrote the date at the top added i make my dbut in november signed her name at the extreme end of the sheet addressed it to her * in paris and sent it it was said that in her dresses the very handsomest silks were used for * and that real lace was used where others put * the bottoms of the skirts for * silk ribbons of the best quality served the purposes of ordinary * and sometimes the buttons were of real gold and silver sometimes set with precious stones not that she ordered these particulars but the * when given carte blanche by those who do not condescend to details so soon exhaust the outside limits of garments that perforce they take to * them inside with gold so to speak and when the bill goes in they depend upon the furnishings to carry out a certain amount of the contract in justifying the price and it was said that these costly dresses after being worn once or twice were cast aside thrown upon the floor given to the * to get them out of sight not an inch of the real lace not one of the * buttons not a scrap of ribbon was ripped off to save and it was said that if she wanted to romp with her dogs in all her finery she did it she was known to have ridden horseback one moonlight night all around the plantation in a white silk * flounced with * and at night when she came from the balls tired tired to death as only balls can render one she would throw herself down upon her bed in her tulle * top or not of the exquisite flowers she did not * make her maid undress her in that position often having her * cut off her because she was too tired to turn over and have them unlaced that she was admired raved about loved even goes without saying after the first month she held the refusal of half the beaux of new orleans men did absurd undignified preposterous things for her and she love marry the idea never occurred to her she treated the most exquisite of her * no better than she treated her paris gowns for the matter of that she could not even bring herself to listen to a proposal patiently whistling to her dogs in the middle of the most ardent protestations or jumping up and walking away with a * of the shoulders and a bah well every one knows what happened after 59 there is no need to repeat the history of one is the history of all but there was this * there is every shade of difference in misfortune as there is every shade of resemblance in happiness mortemart des islets went off to fight that was natural his family had been doing that he thought or said ever since * just as naturally he was killed in the first engagement they his family were always among the first killed so much so that it began to be considered assassination to fight a duel with any of them all that was in the ordinary course of events one difference in their misfortunes lay in that after the city was captured their plantation so near convenient and rich in all kinds of provisions was selected to receive a contingent of * colored company if it had been a colored company raised in louisiana it might have been different and these negroes mixed with the negroes in the * negroes are no better than whites for the proportion of good and bad among themand the officers were always off duty when they should have been on and on when they should have been off one night the dwelling caught fire there was an immediate rush to save the ladies oh there was no hesitation about that they were seized in their beds and carried out in the very arms of their enemies carried away off to the sugarhouse and deposited there no danger of their doing anything but keep very quiet and still in their chemises de * and their one sheet apiece which was about all that was saved from the * is for them but it must be remembered that this is all hearsay when one has not been present one knows nothing of ones own knowledge one can only repeat it has been repeated however that although the house was burned to the ground and everything in it destroyed wherever for a year afterward a man of that company or of that neighborhood was found there could have been found also without * property that had belonged to the des islets that is the story and it is believed or not exactly according to prejudice how the ladies ever got out of the sugarhouse history does not relate nor what they did it was not a time for * either personal or * at one offensive word your letter and you very likely examined and ship island for a hotel with soldiers for hostesses madame des islets died very soon after the * rage they say and that was about all the public knew indeed at that time the society of new orleans had other things to think about than the fate of the des islets as for la grande demoiselle she had prepared for her own oblivion in the hearts of her female friends and the * * * were burning with other passions than those which had driven them to her knees encountering a little more serious response than * and * and after all a woman seems the * thing forgotten when once the important affairs of life come to men for consideration it might have been ten years according to some calculations or ten * heart and the almanac never agree about * one morning old champigny they used to call him * was walking along his levee front calculating how soon the water would come over and drown him out as the louisianians say it was before a * breakfast cold wet rainy and discouraging the road was kneedeep in mud and so broken up with hauling that it was like walking upon waves to get over it a shower poured down old champigny was hurrying in when he saw a figure approaching he had to stop to look at it for it was worth while the head was hidden by a green * veil which the showers had * * with dew a tall thin figure figure no not even could it be called a figure straight up and down like a finger or a post * and a * step like a * no umbrella * more in fact it does not sound so peculiar as when first * must be forgotten the * yes the * were like * or * or anything of that shape old champigny did not care for * never had they simply did not exist for him in the order of nature he had been married once it is true about a half century before but that was not reckoned against the existence of his prejudice because he was * to his * as any one could see a mile away but that woman * him he had no servant to inquire from he performed all of his own domestic work in the wretched little cabin that replaced his old home for champigny also belonged to the great majority of the * * he went out into the * where were one or two hands that worked on shares with him and he asked them they knew immediately there is nothing connected with the parish that a * does not know at once she was the teacher of the colored public school some three or four miles away ah thought champigny some northern lady on a mission he watched to see her return in the evening which she did of course in a blinding rain imagine the green * veil then for it remained always down over her face old champigny could not get over it that he had never seen her before but he must have seen her and with his abstraction and old age not have noticed her for he found out from the negroes that she had been teaching four or five years there and he found out * is not * she was idalie sainte foy mortemart des islets la grande demoiselle he had never known her in the old days owing to his * attitude toward women but he knew of her of course and of her family it should have been said that his plantation was about fifty miles higher up the river and on the opposite bank to reine sainte foy it seemed terrible the old gentleman had had reverses of his own which would bear the telling but nothing was more shocking to him than * idalie sainte foy mortemart des islets should be teaching a public colored school * makes one blush to name * dollars and a half a month for seven dollars and a half a month to teach a set * he found out where she lived a little * so much worse than his own for that * the corner of a field no companion no servant nothing but food and shelter her clothes have been described only the good god himself knows what passed in * mind on the subject we know only the results he went and married la grande demoiselle how only the good god knows that too every first of the month when he goes to the city to buy provisions he takes her with * fact he takes her everywhere with him passengers on the railroad know them well and they always have a chance to see her face when she passes her old plantation la grande demoiselle always lifts her veil for one * inevitable green * veil what a face thin long sallow petrified and the neck if she would only tie something around the neck and her plain coarse * gown the negro women about her were better dressed than she poor old * it was not an act of charity to himself no doubt cross and disagreeable besides being ugly and as for love gratitude this how she told about it sitting in her little * bridal * larger really not larger than sufficed for the bed there the * here the bureau opposite and the washstand behind the door the corners all touching but a nice set of furniture quite comme il * in * a bride of good family should have and she was dressed very prettily too in her long white * with plenty of lace and ruffles and blue * as only the creole girls can make and brides alas * pretty honeymoon costume that suggests that * to proceed the poor little cat as one could not help calling her so * so blond with the pretty black eyes and the rosebud of a * she closed * perfect kiss but you know louise she said beginning quite seriously at the beginning papa would never have consented never * papa indeed i should never have asked him it would only have been one humiliation more for him poor papa so it was well he was dead if it was gods will for it to be of course i had my dreams like everybody i was so blond so blond and so small it seemed like a law i should marry a brun a tall handsome brun with a mustache and a fine * voice that was how i always arranged it * will * a large large house and numbers of servants and a good cook but a * good cuisine and wine and all that and long trailing silk dresses and theater every night and voyages to europe * everything god had to give in fact you know i get that from papa wanting everything god has to give poor papa it seemed to me i was to meet him at any time my handsome brun i used to look for him positively on my way to school and back home again and whenever i would think of him i would try and walk so prettily and look so pretty mon dieu i was not ten years old yet and afterward it was only for that that i went into society what should girls go into society for otherwise but to meet their brun or their blond do you think it is amusing to economize and economize and sew and sew just to go to a party to dance no i assure you i went into society only for that and i do not believe what girls * go into society only for that too you know at school how we used to * la bonne * well every time he was not brun * * jules or * or guy i simply would not accept it but would go on drawing until i obtained what i wanted as i tell you i thought it was my destiny and when i would try with a flower to see if he loved * * un * * * pas du * it were pas du tout i would always throw the flower away and begin tearing off the leaves from another one immediately * was what i wanted and i always got it in the end but papa poor papa he never knew anything of that of course he would get furious when any one would come to see me and sometimes when he would take me in society if i danced with a * he called no matter whom i danced * would come up and take me away with such an * an air it would seem that papa thought himself better than everybody in the world but it went worse and worse with papa not only in the affairs of the world but in health always thinner and thinner always a cough in fact you know i am a little * myself from papa and clementine clementine with her * think louise eight i thank god my mama had only me if * second wife had to have so many and so naughty i assure you they were all devils and no correction no punishment no * you know clementine i tell you sometimes on account of those children i used to think myself in * making the * attempt and failure to pronounce the h and clementine had no pride about them if they had shoes well if they had not shoes well also but clementine i would expostulate i would pray but do not be a fool * she would say am i god can i do miracles or must i * your papa that was true poor papa it would have humiliated papa when he had money he gave only it was a pity he had no money as for what he observed he thought it was * negligence for it is true clementine had no order no industry in the best of fortune as in the worst but to do her justice it was not her fault this time only she let him believe it to save his pride and clementine you know has a genius for stories i assure you louise i was desperate i prayed to god to help me to advise me i could not * had no education i could not go into a * would be * * * i was too pretty and proclaim to the world clementine would cry that your papa does not make money for his family that was true the world is so malicious you know louise sometimes it seems to me the world is glad to hear that a man cannot support his family it compliments those who can as if papa had not intelligence and honor and honesty but they do not count now as in old times before the war and so when i thought of that i laughed and talked and played the thoughtless like clementine and made bills we made * had * everything we could do that you know on our old name and family but it is too long i am sure it is too long and tiresome what egotism on my part come we will take a glass of * and talk of something * trip your family no no you are only asking me out of politeness you are so * so kind well if you are not * fact i want to tell you it was too long to write and i detest a pen to me there is no instrument of torture like a pen well the lady next door she was an american and common very common according to papa in comparison to us she had no family whatever our little children were forbidden even to associate with her little children i thought that was * that i am a democrat but i thought it ridiculous but the children cared they were so disobedient and they were always next door and they always had something nice to eat over there i sometimes thought clementine used to encourage their disobedience just for the good things they got to eat over there but papa was always making fun of them you know what a sharp tongue he had the gentleman was a clerk and according to papa the only true gentlemen in the world had family and a profession we did not dare allow ourselves to think it but clementine and i knew that they in fact were in more comfortable circumstances than we the lady who also had a great number of children sent one day with all the discretion and delicacy possible and asked me if i would be so kind as * what louise but only guess but you never could well to * some of her childrens stockings for her it was god who inspired her i am sure on account of my praying so much to him you will be shocked louise when i tell you it sounds like a sin but i was not in despair when papa died it was a * it seized the heart but it was not despair men ought not to be subjected to the humiliation of life they are not like women you know we are made to stand things they have their * * as we say in * that is the point of honor with some men and clementine and i we could not have concealed it much longer in fact the truth was crying out everywhere in the children in the house in our own persons in our faces the darning did not provide a superfluity i guarantee you poor papa he caught cold he was condemned from the first and so all his fine qualities died for he had fine * were too fine for this age that was all yes it was a kindness of god to take him before he found out if it was to be it was better just so with clementine as with me after the * everything went to pieces we were at the four corners for the necessaries of life and the bills came * dear the bills that came in what memories what memories clementine and i exclaimed there were some bills that we had completely forgotten about the lady next door sent her brother over when papa died he sat up all night that night and he assisted us in all our arrangements and he came in afterward every evening if papa had been there there would have been a fine scene over it he would have had to take the door very likely but now there was no one to make objections and so when as i say we were at the four corners for the necessaries of life he asked * permission to ask me to marry him i give you my word louise i had forgotten there was such a thing as marriage in the world for me i had forgotten it as completely as the * of the * dynasty alas with all the other school things forgotten and i do not believe clementine remembered there was such a possibility in the world for me mon dieu when a girl is poor she may have all the beauty in the * that i had beauty only a little * but you should have seen clementine she screamed for joy when she told me oh there was but one answer according to her and according to everybody she could consult in her haste they all said it was a * of providence in my favor he was young he was strong he did not make a fortune it was true but he made a good living and what an assistance to have a man in the * assistance for clementine and the children but the principal thing after all was he wanted to marry me nobody had ever wanted that before my dear quick quick it was all arranged all my friends did something for me one made my * for me one this one * * i did not recognize myself one made all the toilet of the bureau another of the bed and we all sewed on the weddingdress together and you should have seen clementine going out in all her great mourning looking for a house looking for a servant but the wedding was private on account of poor papa but you know * i had never time to think except about clementine and the children and when i thought of all those poor little children poor * children i said quick quick like the rest it was the next day the morning after the wedding i had time to think i was sitting here just as you see me now in my pretty new * i had been looking at all the pretty presents i have shown you and my trousseau and my * is not bad as you * dress my veil my ring * do not knowi do not * all of a sudden from everywhere came the thought of my brun my handsome brun with the mustache and the bonne * * * the jules * guy and the flower leaves and il * un pen * pas du tout * and the way i expected to meet him walking to and from school walking as if i were dancing the steps and oh my plans my plans my * dresses theater voyages to * poor papa so fine so tall so aristocratic i cannot tell you how it all came it seized my heart and mon dieu i cried out and i wept i wept i wept how i wept it pains me here now to remember it hours hours it lasted until i had no tears in my body and i had to weep without them with sobs and moans but this i have always observed is the time for * the tears are all out and i am sure god himself gave me my thoughts poor little * i thought * done you are going to make a fool of yourself now when it is all over because why it is god who * the world and not you you pray to god to help you in your despair and he has helped you he has sent you a good kind husband who adores you who asks only to be a brother to your sisters and brothers and son to clementine who has given you

miracles of the obscure little chapel there is always a more and a most obscure little miracle chapel and as faith seems ever to lead unhesitatingly to the latter one there is ever rising out of humility and obscurity as in response to a demand some new shrine to replace the wear and tear and loss of other shrines by prosperity for alas it is hard even for a chapel to remain obscure and humble in the face of prosperity and popularity and how to prevent such popularity and prosperity as soon as the noise of a real miracle in it gets abroad every one is for hurrying thither at once with their needs and their prayers their candles and their * and the little miracle chapel perhaps despite itself becomes with * growth a church and the church a cathedral from whose resplendent altars the cheap humble * tablets the modest * of its ecclesiastical fortunes are before long banished to dimly lighted lateral shrines the miracle chapel in question lay at the end of a very confusing but still intelligible route it is not in truth a chapel at all but a consecrated chamber in a very small very lowly cottage which stands or one might appropriately if not with absolute novelty say which * in the center of a large garden a garden primeval in * and size its limits being defined by no lesser boundaries than the four * streets outside and its culture showing only the careless * culture of nature the streets outside were miracles themselves in that with their liquid contents they were streets and not * however they protected their island chapel almost as well as a * moat could have done there was a small paved space on the sidewalk that served to the * as an indication of the spot in the tall long broad fence where a gate might be sought it was a small gate with a strong latch it required a strong hand to open it at the sound of the click it made the little street * who stood near peeping through the fence looked up he had worked quite a hole between the boards with his fingers such an anxious expression passed over his face that even a casual passerby could not help relieving it by a * question is this the miracle chapel little boy yes maam yes then his expression changed to one of eagerness yet hardly less anxious here take this he did not hold out his hand the coin had to seek it at its touch he refused to take it i aint begging what are you looking at so through the fence he was all sadness now just looking is there anything to see inside he did not answer the interrogation was repeated i cant see nothing im blind putting his eyes again to the hole first one then the other come wont you tell me how this came to be a miracle chapel oh * turned his face from the fence and clasped his hands in * was a poor widow woman who come here with her baby that was * and she prayed to the virgin mary and the virgin mary made the baby live he dropped his voice the words falling slower and slower as he raised his face one could see then that he was blind and the accident that had happened to him in fording the street what sightless eyes what a wet muddy little skeleton ten no hardly ten years of age the widow woman she picked up her baby and she run down the walk here and out into the street * was so * his eyes to the * * the virgin mary come down the walk after her and come through the gate too and that was all she * widow woman did you know the widow woman he shook his head how do you know it that was what they told me and they told me the birds all begun to sing at once and the flowers all lighted up like the sun was shining on them they seed her and she come down the walk and through the gate his voice lowering again to a whisper aye how the birds must have sung and the flowers shone to the widowed mother as she ran nay leaped down that * walk with her restored baby clasped to her bosom they seed her repeated the little fellow and that is why you stand hereto see her too his shoulder turned uneasily in the clasp upon it they seed her and they aint got no eyes have you no mother aint never had no mother a thought struck him would that count maam would that count the little baby that was * maam it had a mother and its the mothers that come here constant with their children i sometimes hear em dragging them in by the hand how long have you been coming here ever since the first time i heard it maam street * do not cry it would be better if they did so when they are so young and so blind it would be easier for the spectator the auditor they seed heri might see her * i could see her * i could see anything once his voice faltered but he stiffened it instantly she might see me she cant pass through this gate without seeing me * she seed meand i didnt even see * im so tired of being blind did you never go inside to pray how embarrassing such a question is even to a child no maam does that count too the little baby didnt pray the flowers didnt go inside nor the birds and they say the birds broke out singing all at once and the flowers * like the sun was shining on * the sun was shining in em he corrected himself the birds they can see and the flowers they cant see and they seed her he shivered with the damp * perhaps too with hunger where do you live he wouldnt answer what do you live on he shook his head come with me he could not resist the grasp on his shoulder and the firm directing of his bare muddy feet through the gate up the walk and into the chamber which the virgin found that day he was turned to the altar and pressed down on his knees one should not look at the face of a blind child praying to the virgin for sight only the virgin herself should see thatand if she once saw that little boy there were hearts feet hands and eyes enough hanging around to warrant hope at least if not faith the * of the human aches and pains that had here found relief if not * feet and hands * to no physician for their * of rheumatism eyes and ears indebted to no oculist or * and the * are always in * to the most skeptical there is something sweetly comforting in the sight of so many cured hearts with their thanks cut deep as they should be in the very marble thereof where the bed must have stood was the altar rising by easy * brave in ecclesiastical * to the plaster figure of her whom those yearning hearts were seeing whom those murmuring lips were addressing hearts must be all alike to her at such a distance but the faces to the * were so different the eyes straining to look through all the experiences and troubles that their life has held to plead as only eyes can plead to one who can if she will perform their miracle for them and the * sensitive human * one distorted by the tragedy against which it was praying their miracles their miracles what trifles to divinity perhaps hardly more to humanity how far a simple * could supply them if so minded perhaps a liberal exercise of love and charity by not more than half a dozen welltodo people could answer every prayer in the room but what a miracle that would be and how the virgins heart would gladden * and * over her restored * children even as the widowed mother did over her one dying babe and the little boy had stopped praying the futility of * his own * overcome him he was crying and past the shame of showing * helplessly hopelessly tears were rolling out of his sightless eyes over his * lips he could not pray he could only cry what better after all can any of us do but what a prayer to a * even the plaster figure of a woman and the virgin did hear him for she had him taken without loss of a moment to the hospital and how easy she made it for the physician to remove the * to her be the credit it is really not much the story it is only the arrangement of it as we would say of our dresses and our drawingrooms it began with the dawn of course and the skiff for our voyage silvered with dew waiting in the mist for us as if it had floated down in a cloud from heaven to the bayou when repeated this sounds like poor poetry but that is the way one thinks at day dawn when the dew is yet as it were upon our brains and our ideas are still half dreams and our waking hearts alas as innocent as waking babies playing with their toes our oars waked the waters of the bayou as motionless as a sleeping snake under its misty * continue the poetical language or thought the ripples ran frightened and shivering into the * * of the * banks startling the little birds bathing there into darting to the nearest highest * where without losing their hold on their swaying balancing * they burst into all sorts of incoherent songs in their excitement to divert attention from the * nests bird mothers are so much like women mothers it soon became day enough for the mist to rise the eyes that saw it ought to be able to speak to tell * about it not all at once nor all together but a thinning a lifting a breaking a wearing away a little withdrawing here a little withdrawing there and now a peep and now a peep a bride lifting her veil to her husband blue white lilies blue lilies white lilies blue and white lilies and still blue and white lilies and still and still wherever the veil lifted still and always the bride not in * and bunches not in spots and patches not in banks meadows acres but * for still it lifted beyond and beyond and beyond the eye could not touch the limit of them for the eye can touch only the limit of vision and the lilies filled the whole seamarsh for that is the way spring comes to the * the * might have been * along the waters edge but there were morningglories all colors all * such morningglories as we of the city never see our city morningglories must dream of them as we dream of angels only god could be so lavish dropping from the tall * to the water into the water under the water and then the reflection of them in all their colors blue white pink purple red rose violet to think of an obscure little acadian bayou waking to flow the first thing in the morning not only through banks of * morningglories but sown also to its depths with such reflections as must make it think itself a bayou in heaven instead of in * st martin perhaps that is the reason the poor poets think themselves poets on account of the beautiful things that are only reflected into their minds from what is above besides the reflections there were * in the bayou trying to slip away before we could see them and watching us with their stupid * eyes sometimes from under the thickest prettiest flowery bowers and * * into the water ahead of us and fish * perch looking like reflections themselves floating through the flower reflections * their breakfast our bayou had been running through swamp only a little more solid than itself in fact there was no * but what came from the roots of grasses now the banks began to get firmer from real soil in them we could see cattle in the distance up to their necks in the lilies their heads and * horns coming up and going down in the blue and white nothing makes * heads appear handsomer with the sun just rising far far away on the other side of them the seamarsh cattle turned loose to pasture in the * spring * loose in elysium but the land was only partly land yet and the cattle still cattle to us the rising sun made revelations as our bayou carried us through a drove in their elysium or it might have always been an elysium to us it was not all pasturage all enjoyment the rising and falling feeding head was entirely different as we could now see from the rising and falling agonized head of the * buried alive it is well that the lilies grow taller and thicker over the more treacherous places but misery misery not much of the process was concealed from us for the cattle have to come to the bayou for water such a splendid black head that had just yielded breath the * ebony horns thrown back among the morningglories the mouth open from the last sigh the glassy eyes staring straight at the beautiful blue sky above where a ghostly moon still lingered the velvet neck * with veins and muscles the body already buried in black ooze and such a pretty * * lying on her side opening and shutting her eyes breathing softly in meek resignation to her horrible calamity and again another one was plunging and battling in the act of realizing her doom a fierce furious red cow glaring and bellowing at the soft yielding inexorable * under her the * settling afar off and her own species browsing securely just out of reach they understand that much the seamarsh cattle to keep out of reach of the dead * in the delirium of anguish relief cannot be distinguished from attack and rescue of the victim has been proved to mean * of the * the bayou turned from it at last from our beautiful lily world about which our pleasant thoughts had ceased to flow even in bad poetry our voyage was for information which might be obtained at a certain habitation if not there at a second one or surely at a third and most distant settlement the bayou narrowed into a canal then widened into a bayou again and the low level swamp and prairie advanced into woodland and forest oaktrees began our beautiful oaktrees great branches bent down almost to the * even with high * with forests of oak * * and with vines that swept our heads as we passed under them drooping now and then to trail in the water a * for the fishes and a landingplace for * insects the sun speckled the water with its flickering patterns * us with light and heat we have no spring suns our sun even in december is a summer one and so with all its grace of curve and bend and * description is longer than the * come to our first stoppingplace to the side in front of the * fertile fields like a proud little * stood the little house its pointed * roof covered it like the top of a * reaching down to the windows which peeped out from under it like little eyes a woman came out of the door to meet us she had had time during our graceful winding approach to prepare for us what an * vow to old * at least twentyfive almost a possible grandmother according to acadian computation and well in the grip of advancing years she was dressed in a stiff dark red calico gown with a white apron her black hair smooth and glossy under a varnish of grease was plaited high in the back and dropped regular ringlets six in all over her forehead that was the epoch when her calamity came to her when the hair was worn in that fashion a woman seldom * her * after a calamity of a certain nature happens to her the figure had taken a compact rigidity an unfaltering * all the world away from the elasticity of * and her eyes were clear and fixed like her figure neither falling nor rising nor puzzling under other eyes her lips her hands her slim feet were conspicuously single too in their intent neither reaching nor feeling nor running for those other lips hands and feet which should have doubled their single life that was adorine * otherwise the most industrious acadian and the best * in the parish it had been short her story a womans love is still with those people her story she was thirteen when she met him that is the age for an acadian girl to meet him because you know the large * thirteen fourteen fifteen twenty * up the years and when one wishes to know ones * which is the dream of the acadian girl one must not delay ones story she had one month to love him in and in one week they were to have the wedding the * believe that marriage must come au point as cooks say their * must be served standing on the * in front of the * one could say good day with the eyes to the * * was the name of the parents of the young bridegroom looking under the branches of the oaks one could see across the * and seamarsh it * clearly distinguish another little redwashed house like the * with a painted roof hanging over the windows and a staircase going up outside to the garret with the sun shining in the proper direction one might distinguish more and with love shining like the sun in the eyes one might see one might * heart full it was only the eyes however which could make such a quick voyage to the * * a skiff had a long days journey to reach them the bayou sauntered along over the country like a negro on a sundays * trusting to god for time and to the devil for means oh nothing can travel quickly over a bayou ask any one who has waited on a * for a physician or a * message thought refuses to travel and turn and double over it thought like the eye takes the shortest * over the seamarsh and in the spring of the year when the lilies are in bloom thought could not take a more heavenly way even from beloved to beloved it was the week before marriage that week when more than ones whole life afterward ones heart feels most * in fact it was the week before marriage from sunday to sunday that was all the time to be passed * live through this week by the grace of god or perhaps they would be as unreasonable as the * could look across the prairie to the little red roof during the day and could think across it during the night and get up before day to look across * longing all the time of course one must supply all this from ones own imagination or experience but adorine could sing and she sang one might hear in a favorable wind a * or the barking of a dog from one place to the other so that singing as to effect was nothing more than the * of her looking and thinking and longing when one loves it is as if everything was known of and seen by the other not only all that passes in the head and heart which would in all conscience be more than enough to occupy the other but the talking the dressing the conduct it was then that the back hair was braided and the front curled more and more beautifully every day and that the calico dresses became * and * and the white crochet lace collar broader and lower in the neck at thirteen she was beautiful enough to startle one they say but that was nothing she spent time and care upon these things as if like other women her fate seriously depended upon them there is no selfabnegation like that of a woman in love it was her singing however which most showed that other existence in her existence when she sang at her spinningwheel or her loom or knelt battling clothes on the bank of the bayou her lips would kiss out the words and the tune would rise and fall and tremble as if zepherin were just across there anywhere in fact as if every blue and white lily might hide an ear of him it was the time of the new moon fortunately when all sit up late in the country the family would stop in their talking about the wedding to listen to her she did not know it herself but itthe * getting louder and clearer and poor little thing it told everything and after the family went to bed they could still hear her sitting on the bank of the bayou or up in her window singing and looking at the moon traveling across the lily * all its beauty and brightness no more beautiful and bright than a heart in love it was just past the middle of the week a thursday night the moon was so bright the colors of the lilies could be seen and the singing so sweet so * was the * of the longing of love then it was that the miracle happened to her miracles are always happening to the * she could not sleep she could not stay in bed her heart drove her to the window and kept her there * the civilized it could not take place but here she could sing as she pleased in the middle of the night it was nobodys affair nobodys disturbance saint ann saint joseph saint mary she heard her song answered she held her heart she bent forward she sang again oh the air was full of music it was all music she fell on her knees she listened looking at the moon and with her face in her hands looking at zepherin it was gods choir of angels she thought and one with a voice like zepherin whenever it died away she would sing again and again and again but the sun came and the sun is not created like the moon for lovers and whatever happened in the night there was work to be done in the day adorine worked like one in a * her face as radiant as the upturned face of a saint they did not know what it was or rather they thought it was love love is so different out there they make all kinds of * for it but in truth adorine was still hearing her celestial voices or voice if the * of the chickens the * of the spinningwheel or the * * of the loom effaced it a moment she had only to go to some still place round her hand over her ear and give the line of a song * was * she heard she walked in a dream until night when the moon came up she was at the window and still it continued so faint so sweet that answer to her song echo never did anything more exquisite but she knew nothing of such a heathen as echo human nature became exhausted she fell asleep where she was in the window and dreamed as only a bride can dream of her groom when she awoke adorine adorine the beautiful angel voices called to her zepherin zepherin she answered as if she too were an angel * another angel in heaven it was too much she wept and that broke the charm she could hear nothing more after that all that day was despondency dejection * eyes and tremulous lips the commonplace reaction as all know of love exaltation * family acadian peasants though they were knew as much about it as any one else and all that any one knows about it is that marriage is the * and the only * for love and zepherin a man could better describe his side of that week for it too has mostly to be described from imagination or experience what is inferred is that what adorine longed and thought and looked in silence and resignation according to womans way he suffered equally but in a mans way which is not one of silence or * least when one is a man of * last interview the near wedding her beauty his love her house in sight the full moon the long wakeful nights he took his * but the bayou played with his impatience maddened his passion bringing him so near to * with him again so far away there was only a short prairie between him and a prairie thick with * could almost walk over their heads so close and gleaming in the moonlight but this is all only inference the * was found tethered to the paddle stuck upright in the soft bank * parents related the rest nothing else was found until the summer drought had bared the swamp there was a little girl in the house when we * else were in the * stupid solemn pretty child the child of a brother how she kept away from adorine and how much that testified it would have been too painful the little arms around her neck the head nestling to her bosom * pressing against it and the little one might ask to be sung to sleep sung to sleep the little * with its high * bed covered with the acadian homespun quilt trimmed with netting fringe its bit of mirror over the bureau the bottle of perfumed grease to keep the locks black and glossy the prayerbeads and blessed palms hanging on the wall the low black polished spinningwheel the * * d adorine famed throughout the * ever goodly store of cotton and yarn * swinging from the ceiling and the little square open window which looked under the mossy * to look over the prairie and once again all blue and white * were all there as adorine was there but there was * there old jeanne marie leaned her hand against the house and the tears rolled down her cheeks she had not wept since she buried her last child with her it was one trouble one weeping no more and her wrinkled hard polished skin so far had known only the tears that come after death the trouble in her heart now was almost exactly like the trouble caused by death although she knew it was not so bad as death yet when she thought of this to console herself the tears rolled all the faster she took the end of the red cotton kerchief tied over her head and wiped them away for the furrows in her face did not merely run up and * ran in all directions and carried her tears all over her face at once she could understand death but she could not understand this it came about in this way anne marie and she lived in the little redwashed cabin against which she leaned had lived there alone with each other for fifty years ever since jeanne maries husband had died and the three children after him in the fever epidemic the little * cabin the stable where there used to be a cow the patch of ground planted with onions had all been bought and paid for by the husband for he was a thrifty hardworking * and had he lived there would not have been one better off or with a larger family either in that quarter or in any of the redwashed suburbs with which * has surrounded new orleans his women * wife and * done their share in the work a mans share apiece for with the * women there is no discrimination of sex when it comes to work and they worked on just the same after he died tending the cow digging * planting watering the day following the funeral by daylight jeanne marie was * around the yoke of * to his patrons while anne marie carried the vegetables to market and so on for fifty years they were old women * years * as they expressed it they had always been twins in twins there is always one lucky and one unlucky one jeanne marie was the lucky one anne marie the unlucky one so much so that it was even she who had to catch the rheumatism and to lie now bedridden months at a time while jeanne marie was as active in her sabots as she had ever been in spite of the age of both and the infirmity of one every saturday night there was some little thing to put under the brick in the hearth for taxes and license and the * funeral provision in the husbands time gold pieces used to go in but they had all gone to pay for the four funerals and the * doctors bill the women laid in silver pieces the * however grew smaller and smaller and represented more and more not so much the gain from onions as the saving from food it had been explained to them how they might all at once make a years gain in the * and it had become their custom always at the end of every month to put aside one silver coin apiece to buy a * ticket * ticket each not for the great but for the * prizes anne marie would buy hers round about the market jeanne marie would stop anywhere along her milk course and buy hers and they would go together in the afternoon to stand with the little crowd watching the placard upon which the winning numbers were to be written and when they were written it was curious jeanne maries numbers would come out twice as often as anne maries not that she ever won anything for she was not lucky enough to have them come out in the order to win they only came out here and there singly but it was sufficient to make old anne marie cross and ugly for a day or two and injure the sale of the * when she became bedridden jeanne marie bought the ticket for both on the numbers however that anne marie gave her and anne marie had to lie in bed and wait while jeanne marie went out to watch the placard one evening watching it jeanne marie saw the * write out the numbers as they came on her ticket in such a way that they drew a * dollars when the old woman saw it she felt such a happiness just as she used to feel in the old times right after the birth of a baby she thought of that instantly without saying a word to any one she * over the * as fast as she could in her sabots to tell the good news to anne marie but she did not go so fast as not to have time to dispose of her forty dollars over and over again forty dollars that was a great deal of money she had often in her mind when she was expecting a prize spent twenty dollars for she had never thought it could be more than that but forty dollars a new gown apiece and black silk * to tie over their heads instead of red cotton and the little cabin new redwashed and soup in the pot and a * sausage and a bottle of good costly * for anne maries legs and still a pile of gold to go under the * pile of gold that would have made the eyes of the * husband * she pushed open the * and came into the room where her sister lay in bed eh anne marie my girl she called in her thick * voice apparently made purposely to suit her rough * accent this time we have caught it whose ticket asked anne marie instantly in a flash all anne maries ill luck ran through jeanne maries mind how her promised husband had proved * and jeanne maries faithful and how ever since even to the coming out of her * numbers even to the selling of vegetables even to the catching of the rheumatism she had been the * but above all as she looked at anne marie in the bed all the misery came over jeanne marie of her sisters not being able in all her poor old seventyfive years of life to remember the pressure of the arms of a husband about her waist nor the mouth of a child on her breast as soon as anne marie had asked her question jeanne marie answered it but your ticket cotonma where give it here give it here the old woman who had not been able to move her back for weeks sat bolt upright in bed and stretched out her great bony fingers with the long nails as hard and black as * from * in the earth jeanne marie poured the money out of her cotton handkerchief into them anne marie counted it looked at it looked at it counted it and if she had not been so old so infirm so * the smile that passed over her face would have made it beautiful jeanne marie had to leave her to draw water from the well to water the plants and to get her vegetables ready for next morning she felt even happier now than if she had just had a child happier even than if her husband had just returned to her ill luck cotonma ill luck theres a way to turn ill luck and her smile also should have * her face wrinkled and ugly though it was she did not think any more of the spending of the money only of the pleasure anne marie would take in spending it the water was low in the well and there had been a long drought there are not many old women of seventyfive who could have watered so much ground as abundantly as she did but whenever she thought of the forty dollars and anne maries smile she would give the thirsting plant an extra * the twilight was gaining she paused cotonma she exclaimed aloud but i must see the old woman smile again over her good luck although it was my girl face to face it was always the old woman behind each others back there was a * in the plank walls of the house in spite of anne maries rheumatism they would never stop it up needing it they said for light and air jeanne marie slipped her feet out of her sabots and crept easily toward it smiling and saying cotonma to herself all the way she put her eye to the hole anne marie was not in the bed she who had not left her bed for two months jeanne marie looked through the dim light of the room until she found her anne marie in her short petticoat and * with bare legs and feet was on her knees in the corner pulling up a plank * know hiding when they see * her money * from * to herself and shaking her old grayhaired head hiding her money away from jeanne marie and this was why jeanne marie leaned her head against the side of the house and wept it seemed to her that she had never known her twin sister at all you must picture to yourself the quiet * room of a convalescent outside the dreary bleak days of winter in a sparsely settled distant country parish inside a slow smoldering * a curtained bed the infant sleeping well enough the mother wakeful restless * as a mother must be unfortunately nowadays particularly in that parish where cotton * and * have acquired such a monopoly of ones future god is always pretty near a sick womans couch but nearer even than god seems the * least in that part of the country under those circumstances it is so good to look through the dimness and uncertainty moral and physical and to meet those little black steadfast * eyes to feel those smooth soft * hands to hear across ones sleep that * * * left foot the tiptoe right and the * end of the broomstick and when one is so wakeful and restless and * to have anothers story given one god depend upon it grows stories and lives as he does * each with a mission of balm to some woe she said she had and in truth she had no other name than little mammy and that was the name of her nature pure african but bronze rather than pure black and * only in width her growth having been hampered as to height by an injury to her hip which had * her pulling her figure * and * her with a * of the joint her mother caused it by dropping her when a baby and concealing it for fear of punishment until the * became irremediable all the animosity of which little mammy was capable centered upon this unknown but * mother of hers out of this hatred had grown her * is her destiny a womans love being her destiny little mammys love was for children the birth and infancy the one as accidental as the other one would infer took place * sounds like the arabian nights * place in the great room * stable behind a negrotraders * where human beings underwent literally the daily buying and selling of which the world now complains in a figure of * great square dusty chamber where sitting * leaning against the wall or lying on foul blanket pallets on the floor the * of today made their brief sojourn awaiting transformation into the profits of the morrow the place can be pointed out now is often pointed out but no emotion arises at sight of it it is so plain so matteroffact an edifice that emotion only comes afterward in thinking about it and then in the reflection that such an edifice could be then as now plain and matteroffact for the * there was no capital so valuable as the physical * of his stock the moral was easily enough forged or * little mammys goodfornothing mother was sold as readily as a vote in the parlance of today but no one would pay for a crippled baby the mother herself would not have taken her as a gift had it been in the nature of a negrotrader to give away anything some * was * little mammy heard * effort made to get her * there were attempts to pair her off as a twin sister of various * in age size and color and to palm her off as a substitute at * bereaved * breasts nothing equaled a negrotraders will and power for * except the hereditary distrust and watchfulness which it bred and maintained and so in the even balance between the two * the little cripple remained a * in the stream of life that passed through that back room in the * and * of buying and selling not * * upon a negrotrader for discovering * as substitutes as * she earned her nourishment and providence did not let it kill the little animal before the emancipation of * arrived how much circumstances evoked how much instinct responded belongs to the secrets which nature seems to intend keeping as a baby she had eyes attention solely for other babies one cannot say while she was still crawling for she could only crawl years after she should have been walking but before even precocious * tradition or the old grayhaired negro janitor relates she would creep from baby to baby to play with it put it to sleep pat it rub its stomach a negro baby you know is all stomach and generally aching stomach at that and before she had a lap she managed to force one for some ailing * it was then that they began to call her little mammy in the transitory population of the pen no one stayed long enough to give her another name and no one ever stayed short enough to give her another one her first recollection of herself was that she could not * was past crawling she cradled herself along as she called sitting down flat and working herself about with her hands and her one strong leg * babies walked all around * walking before they * still she did not walk imitate them as she might and did she would sit and study about it make another trial fall sit and study some more make another trial fall again negroes who believe that they must give a reason for everything even if they have to * one were convinced that it was all this studying upon her lameness that gave her such a large head and now she began secretly turning up the clothes of every negro child that came into that pen and examining its legs and still more secretly examining her own stretched out before her on the ground how long it took she does not remember in fact she could not have known for she had no way of measuring time except by her thoughts and feelings but in her own way and time the due process of deliberation was fulfilled and the * made clear that bowed or not all childrens legs were of equal length except her own and all were alike not one full strong hard the other soft * wrinkled growing out of a knot at the hip a whole psychological period apparently lay between that conclusion * * walkingstick but the broomstick came as it was bound to * * that * and what with stretching one limb to make it longer and doubling up the other to make it shorter she invented that form of * which is still carrying her through life and with no more exaggerated * than many careless negroes born with straight limbs display this must have been when she was about eight or nine hobbling on a broomstick with no doubt the same weird * face as now an innate sense of the fitness of things must have suggested the kerchief tied around her big head and the * rag of an apron in front of her * rag of a gown and the bit of broken * in the corner of her mouth where the pipe should have been and where it was in after years that is the way she recollected herself and that is the way one recalls her now with a few modifications the others came and went but she was always there it wasnt long before she became little mammy to the grown folks too and the * inmates soon learned to cry wheres little mammy oh little mammy little mammy such a misery in my head or my back or my stomach cant you help me little mammy it was curious what a quick eye she had for symptoms and ailments and what a quick ear for suffering and how apt she was at picking up remembering and * remedies it never occurred to her not to crouch at the head or the foot of a sick pallet day and night through as for the nights she said she dared not close her eyes of nights the room they were in was so vast and sometimes the negroes lay so thick on the floor rolled in their blankets you know even in the summer they sleep under blankets all * so loudly she would never have heard a groan or a * any more than they did if she had slept too and negro mothers are so careless and such heavy sleepers all night she would creep at regular intervals to the different pallets and draw the little babies from under or away from the heavy inert impending mother forms there is no telling how many she thus saved from being * and smothered or what was worse maimed and crippled whenever a physician came in as he was sometimes called to look at a valuable investment or to * up some piece of damaged goods she always managed to get near to hear the directions and she generally was the one to apply them also for negroes always would steal medicines most * one from the other and when death at times would slip into the pen despite the traders utmost * and * death often had to do little mammy * the time of some of them came to die and when the rest of the negroes with african greed of eye for the horrible would press around the lowly couch where the agonizing form of a slave lay writhing out of life she would always to the last give medicines and wipe the cold forehead and soothe the clutching * hands hoping to the end and trying to inspire the hope that his or her time had not come yet for as she said our time doesnt come just as often as it does come and in those sad last offices which somehow have always been under reproach as a kind of shame no matter how young she was she was always too old to have the childish avoidance of them on the contrary to her a corpse was only a kind of baby and she always strove she said to make one like the other easy and comfortable and in other emergencies she divined the mysteries of the flesh as other * divine the mysteries of painting and music and so become child wonders others came and went she alone remained there babies of her * * she a * had * having babies themselves now the middleaged had had time to grow old and die every week new families were coming into the great back chamber every week they passed out babies boys girls * * stalwart youths and the * grave serious ones whom misfortune had driven from their old masters and the * ones the * * lazy whom the cunning of the negrotrader alone could keep in circulation all were * all were bought and sold all passed in one door and out the * except her little mammy as with her lameness it took time for her to recognize to understand the fact she could study over her lameness she could in the dull course of time think out the broomstick way of palliation it would have been almost better under the circumstances for god to have kept the truth from her * keeps so little of the truth from us women it is his system poor little thing it was not now that her master could not sell her but he would not out of her own intelligence she had forged her chains the lameness was a * merely in comparison she had become too valuable to the negrotrader by her services among his crew and offers only * his determination not to sell her visiting physicians after short acquaintance with her capacities would offer what were called fancy prices for her planters who heard of her through their purchases would come to the city purposely to secure at any cost so inestimable an adjunct to their plantations even * delicate * came to the pen personally to back money with influence in vain little mammy was worth more to the negrotrader simply as a kind of insurance against accidents than any sum however glittering the figure and he was no ignorant expert in human wares she can tell it no one else can for her remember that at times she had seen the streets outside remember that she could hear of the outside world daily from the passing * the plantations farms families the green fields sunday woods running streams the * * * * the * marriages funerals * the holidays and holy days

she might have nursed and * with children whom she might have reared and not a lady of that kind saw her face but wanted her yearned for her pleaded for her coming back secretly to slip silver and sometimes gold pieces into her hand patting her turbaned head calling her little mammy too instantly by inspiration and making the negrotrader give them with all sorts of assurances the refusal of her she had no need for the whispered buy me master buy me mistress youll see how i can work master youll never be sorry mistress of the others the * * negrotraders are fitted by nature for their * came

at times she determined to * her usefulness mar her value by * her heart denying her purpose for days she would tie her kerchief over her ears and eyes and crouch in a corner strangling her impulses she even * refused food became dumb and she might have succeeded in making herself * through incipient * if through no other way had she been able to maintain her role long enough but some woman or baby always was falling into some emergency of pain and illness how it might have ended one does not like to think fortunately one does not need to think there came a night she sat alone in the vast

but she did not know them for alarmbells alarm brooded in the dim space around her but she did not even recognize that her protracted tension of heart had made her * to all but one peradventure once or twice she forgot herself and limped over to some heap to relieve an imaginary struggling babe or moaning sleeper morning came she had dozed she looked to see the * stir they lay as still as corpses the alarmbells had ceased she looked to see a new gang enter the far door she listened for the gathering buzzing of voices in the next room around the * she waited for the * she waited for the janitor

and he had vanished in the din and smoke of a war which he had not been entirely guiltless of producing leaving little mammy locked up behind him had he forgotten her one cannot even hope so she hobbled out into the street leaning on her * broomstick she had grown only slightly beyond it could still use it by bending over it her head tied in a rag kerchief a rag for a gown a rag for an apron free she was free but she had not hoped for freedom the plantation the household the delicate ladies the teeming * they were in comparison to freedom * was what she had asked what she had prayed for god she said had let her drop just as her mother had done more than ever she grieved as she crept down the street that she had never mounted the * block an * free negro she knew no one whose duty it was to help her no one knew her to help her in the whole world it was all she had asked there was no white child to call her mammy no white * or gentleman it was the extent of her dreams * to her as to a nurse and all her innumerable black * even the janitor whom she had tended as the others had deserted her like his white prototype she tried to find a place for herself but she had no * no * she dared not mention the name of the negrotrader it banished her not only from the households of the whites but from those of the * of her own color and everywhere soldiers * the * whose tone and accent reminded her of the negrotrader her sufferings whether imaginary or real were sufficiently acute to drive her into the only form of escape which once had been possible to friendless negroes she became a runaway with a bundle tied to the end of a stick over her shoulder just as the old prints represent it she fled from her * and loneliness from her ignoble past and the * termination of it following a railroad track * afoot sleeping by the roadside she lived on until she came to the one familiar landmark in life to * sick woman but a white one and so progressing from patient to patient it was a time when sick white women studded the country like * she arrived at a little town a kind of a refuge for soldiers wives and widows she never traveled further she could not always as in the pen some emergency of pain and illness held her that is all she is still there the poor poor women of that stricken region say that little mammy was the only * god left them after sheridan passed through and the richer ones say very much the same thing but one should hear her tell it herself as has been said on a cold gloomy winter day in the country the fire glimmering on the hearth the overworked

long neck into such faulty prominence and the sleeves crisp puffs of tulle divided by bands of red velvet through which the poor lean arm runs like a wire stringing them together like beads yes it was she the whilom dugazon of the opera troupe not that she ever was a dugazon but that was what her voice once aspired to be a dugazon * would better describe her what a ghost but they always appeared like mere * of real women for what woman of flesh and blood can seriously maintain through life the rle of sham attendant on sham sensations and play public * of other womens loves and lovers singing

me from following what was perhaps more profitable the * of course wastes no music upon her flinging to her only an occasional * in two notes but always ending in a reef of a scale trill or * for her to wreck her voice on before the audience the chef * if he is charitable starts her off with a contribution from his own lusty lungs and then * her voice is always thinner and more * than her arms and her smile no more graceful than her train as well think of the * trees * and * leaving the stage as the dugazon one always * them singing on into dimness * * and uselessness until like any other piece

suffered and finished what a comfort to wake up and find ones self dead well dead i could have continued and put the whole opera troupe in costume de ghost but i think it was the womans eyes that drew me back to her face and her story she had a sensible face now that i observed her naturally as it were and her * i have agonized over those hands on the * * and exaggerated veins clutching her dress as she sang or petrified outstretched to * * ces * hands were the hands of an honest hardworking woman who * her own skirts and at need could * her own floor her face my description following my wandering * face was careworn almost to * not * as alas the faces of the more gifted ladies of opera * too often are there was no * in it of * * and * upon it none of the tracery left by nightly

would have served her she had not beauty enough to fear the flattering dangers of masculine snares and * there may have been other * as a * was something about her that guaranteed * would have blossomed love and children as a * does figs in truth she was just talking about children the first part of her story had passed her birthplace education situation and now she was saying i have always had the temptation but i have always resisted it * a blush at her * may be your spring weather your birds your flowers your * your children in the streets the longing came over me yesterday i thought of it on the stage i thought of it * was better than sleeping and this * eyes moistened she breathed * was determined i gave up i made inquiry i was sent to you would it be possible would there be any place any rle she said first in any of your asylums in any of your charitable institutions for me i would ask nothing but my clothes and food and very little of that the recompense would be the * little girl children with a * you imagine the smile of a woman dreaming of children that might be think never to have held a child in my arms more than a moment never to have felt a childs arms about my neck never to have known a child born on a stage my mother born on a stage ah there were tragic possibilities in that voice and movement pardon madam you see how i repeat and you must be very wearied hearing about me but i could be their nurse and their servant i would bathe and dress them play with them teach them their prayers and when they are sick they would see no difference they would not know but what their mother was there oh she had her * all prepared one could see that and i would sing to * no with a quick gesture nothing from the stage little songs and * i have picked up traveling around and hesitating little things i have composed * things that i thought children would like to hear some day what did she not unconsciously throw into those last words i dream of it she pursued talking with as little regard to me as on the stage she sang to the prima donna their little arms their little faces their little lips and in an asylum there would be so many of them when they cried and were in trouble i would take them in my lap and i would say to them with all sorts of tenderness she had arranged that in her * * the * of what she would say to them in their distress but women are that way when once they begin to love their hearts are * for them to feel through and my heart * to commence right here now at once it seems to me i cannot wait ah madam no more stage no more opera speaking quickly * as i said it may be your beautiful spring your flowers your birds and your numbers of children i have always loved that place most where there are most children and you have more children here than i ever saw anywhere children are so beautiful it is strange is it not when you consider my life and my rearing her life her rearing how interesting they must have been what a pity i had not listened more attentively they say you have much to do with asylums here evidently when rles do not exist in life for certain characters god has to create them and thus he had to create a rle in an asylum for my friend for so she became from the instant she spoke of children as she did it was the * and * of asylums and the poor little orphaned * it is better not to speak of them how can god ever expect to rear children without their mothers but the rle i craved to create for my friend was far * good honest * interior where lips are coarse and cheeks are ruddy and where life is composed of real scenes set to the real music of life the homely successes and failures and loves and hates and * and tears that fill out the orchestra of the heart where romance and poetry abound au * and * where children grow as thick as nature permits the domestic interior of the opera porter for instance or the * over the way but what a loss the * would have suffered and the dreary lacking there would have been in the lives of the children for there must have been moments in the lives of the children in that asylum when they felt awake as they felt in their sleep when they dreamed their mothers were about them she was coming down on the boat from cincinnati the little convent girl two sisters had brought her aboard they gave her in charge of the captain got her a stateroom saw that the new little trunk was put into it hung the new little satchel up on the wall showed her how to bolt the door at night shook hands with her for goodby * have really no significance for sisters and left her there after a while the bells all rang and the boat in the awkward * fashion of boats got into * the chambermaid found her sitting on the chair in the stateroom where the sisters had left her and showed her how to sit on a chair in the saloon and there she sat until the captain came and hunted her up for supper she could not do anything of herself she had to be initiated into everything by some one else she was known on the boat only as the little convent girl her name of course was registered in the clerks office but on a steamboat no one thinks of consulting the clerks ledger it is always the little widow the fat madam the tall colonel the parson etc the captain who pronounced by the letter always called her the little convent girl she was the beauideal of the little convent girl she never raised her eyes except when spoken to of course she never spoke first even to the chambermaid and when she did speak it was in the wee shy * voice one might imagine a * violet to have and she walked with such soft easy carefully calculated steps that one naturally felt the * that must have secured * dictated by a black code of deportment she was dressed in deep mourning her black straw hat was trimmed with stiff new crape and her stiff new bombazine dress had crape collar and cuffs she wore her hair in two long * fastened around her head tight and fast her hair had a strong inclination to curl but that had been taken out of it as * as the noise out of her * her hair was as black as her dress her eyes when one saw them seemed blacker than either on account of the * of the white surrounding the pupil her eyelashes were almost as thick as the black veil which the sisters had fastened around her hat with an extra pin the very last thing before leaving she had a round little face and a tiny pointed chin her mouth was slightly * from the teeth over which she tried to keep her lips well shut the effort giving them a pathetic little forced expression her complexion was sallow a pale sallow the complexion of a brunette bleached in darkened rooms the only color about her was a blue * ribbon from which a large silver * of the virgin hung over the place where a breast pin should have been she was so little so little although she was eighteen as the sisters told the captain otherwise they would not have permitted her to travel all the way to new orleans alone unless the captain or the clerk remembered to fetch her out in front she would sit all day in the cabin in the same place crocheting lace her * of thread and box of patterns in her lap on the handkerchief spread to save her new dress never leaning * no always straight and stiff as if the * back board were there within call she would eat only convent fare at first notwithstanding the * of the waiters and the * of the captain and particularly of the clerk every one knows the fund of humor possessed by a steamboat clerk and what a field for display the table at * affords on friday she fasted rigidly and she never began to eat or finished without a little latin movement of the lips and a sign of the cross and always at six oclock of the evening she remembered the * although there was no church bell to remind her of it she was in mourning for her father the sisters told the captain and she was going to new orleans to her mother she had not seen her mother since she was an infant on account of some disagreement between the parents in consequence of which the father had brought her to cincinnati and placed her in the convent there she had been for twelve years only going to her father for vacations and holidays so long as the father lived he would never let the child have any communication with her mother now that he was dead all that was changed and the first thing that the girl herself wanted to do was to go to her mother the mother superior had arranged it all with the mother of the girl who was to come personally to the boat in new orleans and receive her child from the captain presenting a letter from the mother superior a * of which the sisters gave the captain it is a long voyage from cincinnati to new orleans the rivers doing their best to make it interminable embroidering themselves ad * all over the country every five miles and sometimes oftener the boat would stop to put off or take on freight if not both the little convent girl sitting in the cabin had her terrible * at first from the hideous noises attendant on these * whistles the * of the bells the running to and fro the shouting every time she thought it was shipwreck death judgment purgatory and her sins her sins she would drop her crochet and clutch her prayerbeads from her pocket and relax the constraint over her lips which would go to rattling off prayers with the velocity of a relaxed * that was at first before the captain took to * her out in front to see the boat make a landing then she got to liking it so much that she would stay all day just where the captain put her going inside only for her meals she forgot herself at times so much that she would draw her chair a little closer to the railing and put up her veil actually to see better no one ever usurped her place quite in front or intruded upon her either with word or look for every one learned to know her * and began to feel a personal interest in her and all wanted the little convent girl to see everything that she possibly could and it was worth * balancing and * and * of the * old boat to make a landing it seemed to be always attended with the difficulty and the * of a new enterprise and the relief when it did * up anywhere within * of the spot aimed at and the * throwing the rope from the perilous end of the dangling * and the dangling * hanging like drops of water from * sometimes twenty feet to the land and not * into the river itself and then what a rolling of barrels and * of sacks and singing of jim crow songs and pacing of jim crow steps and black skins glistening through torn shirts and white teeth gleaming through red lips and laughing and talking * * surely the little convent girl in her convent walls never dreamed of so much * noise and movement in the world the first time she heard the * must have been like the first time woman ever heard * and swear she turned pale and ran quickly quickly into the saloon * out again no indeed not with all the soul she had to save and all the other sins on her conscience she shook her head resolutely and was not seen in her chair on deck again until the captain not only reassured her but guaranteed his * and after that whenever the boat was about to make a landing the mate would first glance up to the guards and if the little convent girl was sitting there he would change his invective to sarcasm and politely request the colored gentlemen not to hurry * no account whatever to take their time about * out the plank to send the rope ashore by * him when it got there begging them not to strain their backs calling them mister colonel major general prince and your royal * which was vastly amusing at night however or when the little convent girl was not there language flowed in its natural curve the mate swearing like a pagan to make up for lost time the captain forgot himself one day it was when the boat ran aground in the most unexpected manner and place and he went to work to express his opinion as only steamboat captains can of the pilot mate engineer crew boat river country and the world in general ringing the bell first to back then to head shouting himself * than his own * he chanced to see the little black figure hurrying through the chaos on the deck and the captain stuck as fast aground in * as the boat had done in the evening the little convent girl would be taken on the upper deck and going up the steep stairs there was such confusion to keep the black skirts well over the stiff white petticoats and coming down such blushing when suspicion would cross the unprepared face that a rim of white stocking might be visible and the thin feet laced so tightly in the glossy new leather boots would cling to each successive step as if they could never never make another venture and then one boot would there is but that word hesitate out and feel and feel around and have such a pause of helpless agony as if indeed the next step must have been wilfully removed or was nowhere to be found on the wide wide earth it was a miracle that the pilot ever got her up into the pilothouse but * have a lonely time and do not hesitate even at miracles when there is a chance for company he would place a box for her to climb to the tall bench behind the wheel and he would arrange the cushions and open a window here to let in air and shut one there to cut off a draft as if there could be no tenderer consideration in life for him than her comfort and he would talk of the river to her explain the chart pointing out eddies whirlpools shoals depths new beds old beds * * banks and making banks as exquisitely and respectfully as if she had been the river commission it was his opinion that there was as great a river as the mississippi flowing directly under * * of a river as much a * of the other as the second story of a house is of the first in fact he said they were * through the upper story whirlpools were holes in the floor of the upper river so to speak eddies were * and cracks and deep under the earth hurrying toward the subterranean stream were other streams small and great but all deep hurrying to and from that great * underneath just as the small and great * streams hurry to and from their mother mississippi it was almost more than the little convent girl could take in at least such was the expression of her eyes for they opened as all eyes have to open at pilot stories and he knew as much of astronomy as he did of * could call the stars by name and define the shapes of the constellations and she who had studied astronomy at the convent was charmed to find that what she had learned was all true it was in the pilothouse one night that she forgot herself for the first time in her life and stayed up until after nine oclock although she appeared almost intoxicated at the wild pleasure she was immediately overwhelmed at the wickedness of it and observed much more rigidity of conduct thereafter the engineer the * the firemen the * they all knew when the little convent girl was up in the pilothouse the * became so mild and gentle with all the delays of river and boat however there is an end to the journey from cincinnati to new orleans the latter city which at one time to the impatient seemed at the terminus of the never began all of a sudden one day to make its * felt and from that period every other interest paled before the interest in the * of arrival into port and the whole boat was seized with a panic of preparation the little convent girl with the others although so immaculate was she in person and effects that she might have been struck with a landing as some good people might be struck with death at any moment without fear of results her trunk was packed and * her satchel arranged and rearranged and the last day her hair was brushed and plaited and smoothed over and over again until the very last glimmer of a curl disappeared her dress was * as if for microscopic inspection her face was washed and her * were * with the hard convent * until the disciplined little tips ached with a pristine * and still there were hours to wait and still the boat added up delays but she arrived at last after all with not more than the usual and expected difference between the actual and the advertised time of arrival there was extra blowing and extra ringing shouting commanding rushing up the gangway and rushing down the gangway the clerks sitting behind tables on the first deck were plied in the twinkling of an eye with estimates receipts charges * claims * demands questions accusations threats all at * voices none but steamboat clerks could have stood it and there were throngs composed of individuals every one of whom wanted to see the captain first and at once and those who could not get to him shouted over the heads of the others and as usual he lost his temper and politeness and began to do what he termed * captain captain a voice called him to where a hand plucked his sleeve and a letter was thrust toward him the cross and the name of the convent he recognized the * of the mother superior he read the duplicate of the letter given by the sisters he looked at the * * then again and again the little convent girl saw him coming leading some one toward her she rose the captain took her hand first before the other greeting goodby my dear he said he tried to add something else but seemed undetermined what be a good little girl it was evidently all he could think of nodding to the woman behind him he turned on his heel and left one of the * was sent to fetch her trunk he walked out behind them through the cabin and the crowd on deck down the stairs and out over the gangway the little convent girl and her mother went with hands tightly clasped she did not turn her eyes to the right or left or once what all passengers do look backward at the boat which however slowly had carried her surely over dangers that she * not of all looked at her as she passed all wanted to say goodby to the little convent girl to see the mother who had been deprived of her so long some expressed surprise in a whistle some in other ways all exclaimed audibly or to themselves colored it takes about a month to make the round trip from new orleans to cincinnati and back counting five days * in new orleans it was a month to a day when the steamboat came puffing and blowing up to the wharf again like a stout * after too long a walk and the same scene of confusion was enacted as it had been enacted twelve times a year at almost the same wharf for twenty years and the same calm a death calmness by contrast followed as usual the next morning the decks were quiet and clean one cargo had just been delivered part of another stood ready on the levee to be shipped the captain was there waiting for his business to begin the clerk was in his office getting his books ready the voice of the mate could be heard below * the old crew out and a new crew in for if steamboat crews have a single * there are those who deny them * is never to ship twice in succession on the same boat it was too early yet for any but * * and * so early that even the river was still

turned the mother of the little convent girl stood there and she held the little convent girl by the hand i have brought her to see you the woman said you were so * she is so quiet so still all the time i thought it would do her a pleasure she spoke with an accent and with embarrassment otherwise one would have said that she was bold and assured enough she dont go nowhere she dont do nothing but make her crochet and her prayers so i thought i would bring her for a little visit of how d ye do to you there was perhaps some * in the womans voice that might have made known or at least awakened

green and rustic appears to us now the world in the early days of the settlement of georgia sometimes to women listening to the stories of their grandmothers it seems better to have lived then than * grandmother was at that time a young wife it was the day of arduous if not of long * before marriage when every wedding celebrated the close of an original romance and when young couples for bridal trips went out to settle new states riding on a * generally with their * following as best they could on * mules to hear the grandmother describe it made one long to be a bride of those days the young husband had the enumeration of qualities that went to the making of a man of that period and if the qualities were in the proportion of ten physical to one intellectual it does not follow that the grandmothers grandfather was not a man of parts for to obtain the hand of his bride an only child and an heiress he had to give test of his mettle by ignoring his fortune studying law and getting his license before marriage and binding himself to live the first year afterward on the proceeds of his practice a device of the time thought to be a wholesome * of the * influence of * in young * although he had already chosen the sea for his profession and was a midshipman at the time with more of a reputation for living than for learning such was he and such it may be said was the incentive genius of his choice that almost before his resignation as midshipman was accepted his license as a lawyer was signed as for practice it was * remarked at his wedding at the sight of him flying down the room in the reel with his bride for partner that his tongue was as nimble as his heels and that if he only turned his attention to criminal practice there was no man in the country who would make a better prosecuting attorney for the state and with him for prosecuting attorney it was warranted that * the * would not continue to hold georgia * justice in quite such contemptible estimation and that the gallows would not be left so long bereft of their legitimate * as for * it was predicted that the young fellow as he stood or rather * could snap his fingers at both his and his brides

independent knights of the road that other counties in georgia furnished more secure pasturage for them it was a beautiful spring morning the young wife bade him a hearty goodby and stood in the doorway watching him gay and debonair riding off on his stout black charger beetle in the direction of the town in which court was to be held that week she herself feeling as full of ambition and work as if she also were prosecuting attorney with a perennial spring of eloquence bubbling in her brain turned to her domestic duties and without going into the detail of them it * to say that according to the grandmothers estimation one mornings list of duties for a healthy young bride of that period would shame the weeks work of a syndicate of them today finding herself nearing the limit of diminution of several household necessities and the spring suggesting the beginning of new ones she made up her mind to profit by her husbands absence and the fair weather to make a trading visit to the neighboring town next day so early in a morning as beautiful as the preceding one mounted on her own stanch mare maid marion she * down the green overhung * in the vista of which she had watched her husband disappear the day before thinking about what she had to buy and thinking no doubt much more as brides will of the absent lord and * brides of those days loved to consider and * their

beetle hitched to the rack under the tree that shadowed the hostelry it was not * but she was young and the day of her first separation from her husband had been so long and was he not also against the * of resolutions and plans hastening back to her the separation being too long for him also slipping her foot from the stirrup she jumped to the ground and ran into the tavern there he stood calling hastily for a drink and her heart more than her eyes took in his to her consecrated * * short clothes blue coat cocked hat ruffles she crept up behind to surprise him her face with its delight

apprehensions on her back * with her eyes the highway ahead of her shooting hawks glances into the forest on each side of her the wife rode through the distance all all day praying that the day might be long enough might equal the distance the sun set and night began to fall but she and maid marion were none the less fresh except in the heart the moon rose straight before them down the road lighting it and them through the threatened obscurity and so they came to trampled earth and torn grass and so she uncovered concealed footsteps and so creeping on her hands and knees she followed traces of blood through thicket and glade into the deep forest to a hastily piled hillock of earth gravel and leaves burrowing with her hands she came to it the naked body of her young husband cold and stiff * murdered maid marion approached at her call she wrapped him in her cloak * young wife of those times alone would do * him in the saddle before her the good mare maid marion alone knows the rest in the early gray dawn from one highway there rode into the town the baffled pursuers from the other the grandmothers grandmother clasping the corpse of her husband with arms as stiff as his own loving him so the grandmother used to say with a love which if ever love could do so would have effected a resurrection the news came out in the papers that the old lady had been restored to her fortune she had been deprived of it so long ago that the real manner of her * had become lost or at least hidden under the many * that had been invented to replace lapses of memory or to remedy the * of the original truth the face of truth like the face of many a good woman is liable to the accident of ugliness and the desire to * one as well as the other need not necessarily proceed from anything more * than an * love of the beautiful if the old lady had not been restored to her fortune her * would have remained in the oblivion which as one might say had accumulated upon everything belonging to her but after that newspaper paragraph there was such a flowering of memory around her name as would have done credit to a whole cemetery on all saints it took three generations to do justice to the old lady for so long and so slow had been her descent into poverty that a grandmother was needed to remember her setting out upon the road to it she set out as most people do well provided with money diamonds pretty clothing handsome residence equipage * * for she was a widow and so many many friends that she could never indulge in a small * always had to give a grand ball to accommodate them she made quite an occasion of her first * * decided against * said it came from the courts having only one ear and that * by the other party she always said whatever she thought regardless of the consequences because she averred truth was so much more interesting than falsehood nothing annoyed her more in society than to have to listen to the compositions women make as a substitute for the original truth it was as if when she went to the theater to hear * and * the actors should try to impose upon the audience by reciting lines of their own truth was the wit of life and the wit of books she traveled her road from affluence so leisurely that nothing escaped her eyes or her feelings and she signaled unhesitatingly every stage in it my dear do you know there is really such a thing as existence without a carriage and * assure you it is perfectly new to me to find that an * is not a necessity it is a luxury in theory one can really never tell the distinction between luxuries and * absurd at one time i thought hair was given us only to furnish a profession to * just as we wear artificial flowers to support the * my word it is not uninteresting there is always some * * in economy the ways of depriving ones self are infinite there is wine * own your residence as soon not own your tomb as your residence my mama used to scream that in my ears according to her it was not comme il faut to board or live in a rented house how little she knew when her friends learning her increasing difficulties which they did from the best authority herself complimented her as they were forced to do upon her still handsome appearance pretty laces feathers jewelry silks fat she would * i am living off my fat as bears do in winter in truth i remind myself of an animal in more ways than one and so every one had something to contribute to the conversation about * which they said affection and admiration had kept alive in their memory each city has its own roads to certain ends its ways of calvary so to speak in new orleans the victim seems ever to walk down royal street and up * or vice * one would infer so at least from the display in the shops and windows of those thoroughfares old furniture cut glass pictures books jewelry lace * * sometimes the flesh still * to it left on the brambles by the driven herd if there should some day be a trump of resurrection for * fortunes those shops would be emptied in the same twinkling of the eye allowed to tombs for their rendition of property the old lady must have made that promenade many many times to judge by the * of her fat or * displayed in the windows she took to hobbling as if from tired or sore feet it is nothing in answer to an inquiry * feet learning to walk in * shoes that is all ones feet after all are the most * part of ones body tea was her * coffee her adoration but she explained tea you know is so detestable that the very worst is hardly worse than the very best while coffee is so perfect that the smallest shade of * is not to be tolerated the truly economical i observe always drink tea at one time i thought if all the luxuries of the world were exposed to me and but one choice allowed i should select gloves believe me there is no superfluity in the world so easily dispensed with as may be supposed her path led her farther and farther away from her old friends even her intimates became scarce so much so that these observations which of course could be made only to intimates became fewer and fewer unfortunately for her circumstances were becoming such that the remarks became increasingly valuable the last thing related of her was apropos of friends my friends my dear i cannot tell you just so on the spur of the moment but with a little reflection and calculation i could tell you to a picayune the rent of every friend in the market you can lease rent or hire them like horses carriages * servants by year month day or hour and the tariff is just as fixed christians christians are the most discreet people in the world if you should ask me what christianity has most promoted in the world i should answer without hesitation discretion of course when i say the world i mean society and when i say christianity i mean our interpretation of it if only * could be pastors and pastors * but of course you do not know what * are they are the guardian angels of the * the pursuing fiends of the debtor after that the old lady made her disappearance under the waves of that sea into the depths of which it is very improbable that a single friend ever attempted to pursue her and there she remained until the news came that she was restored to fortune a week passed two weeks no sight or sound of her it was during this period that her old friends were so occupied * their old friendships for * all her antique sayings and doings became current ballroom and dinnertable * she arose from her obscurity like * from her ashes to be decked with every gift that fairy minds could suggest those who had known her intimately made no effort to conceal their importance those who did not know her personally put forward claims of inherited friendship and those who did not know her traditionally or * * riches and * who alone feel the moneyed value of such social * making their resolutions to capture her as soon as she came in sight of society the old residence was to be * and * from france the * * at the opera had been engaged the old cook was to be hired back from the club at a fabulous price the old balls and the old dinners were to gladden the * said they who seemed to know nothing was to be spared nothing * her age with no child or relative and life running short for pleasure diamonds laces * champagne chteau * dieu * the old creole servants exclaimed raising their hands at the enumeration of it where the news came from nobody knew but everything was certified and accepted as facts although as between women the grain of salt should have been used impatience waxed until nearly every day some one would ring the bell of the old residence to ask when the mistress was going to move in and such affectionate messages and people would not simply could not be satisfied with the incomprehensible answers and then it * out the old lady was simply waiting for everything to * * carriage * make a grand entre into her old sphere to come riding on a throne as it were and still the time passed and she did not come finally two of the * penetrated the * * * * long out of the world so old perhaps not sure of her welcome so they determined to seek her out we will go to her like children to a grandmother etc the others have no delicacy of sentiment etc and she will thus learn who really remember really love her etc provided with congratulatory bouquets they set forth it is very hard to find a dweller on the very * of poverty perhaps that is why the effort is so seldom made one has to ask at * shops * * chinese * interview corner * * gutter children but nothing is impossible to the determined the two ladies overcame all obstacles and * their way along where under other circumstances they would not have glanced would have thought it improper to glance they were directed through an old old house out on an old old gallery to a room at the very extreme end poor thing evidently she has not heard the good news yet we will be the first to communicate it they whispered standing before the dilapidated * door before knocking they listened as it is the very wisdom of discretion to do there was life inside a little kind of voice like some one trying to hum a song with a very cracked old throat the ladies opened the door ah my friend ah my friend restored restored at last at last just the same exactly the same it was which one would get to her first with bouquet and kiss competition almost crowding friendship the good news the good news we could not stay we had to come it has arrived at last at last it has arrived the old lady was very much older but still the same you will again have a chance restored to your friends the world your luxuries your comforts comforts luxuries at last the old lady had an opportunity to slip in a word and friends you say right there was a * pause which held not a small measure of embarrassment but the two visitors although they were women of the world and so dreaded an embarrassment more than they did sin had prepared themselves even to stand this the old lady standing * was very much thinner very much bent but still the * to be looking not at them but at their enumeration comfort she opened a pot bubbling on the fire * a good * * luxury she picked up something from a chair a handful of new cotton chemises luxury she turned back her * new cotton sheets did you ever lie in your bed at night and dream of sheets comfort luxury i should say so and friends my dear look opening her door pointing to an opposite gallery to the yard her own gallery to the washing * sewing women the * * * men to the screaming laughing crying quarreling swarming children friends all * for fifteen years ah yes indeed we are all * in fact as you say i am restored the visitors simply reported that they had found the old lady and that she was imbecile mind completely gone under stress of poverty and old age their opinion was that she should be interdicted but what does this extraordinary display of light mean ejaculated my aunt the moment she entered the parlor from the diningroom it looks like the kingdom of heaven in here jules jules she called come and put out some of the light jules was at the front door letting in the usual * visitor but now he came running in immediately with his own invention in the way of a * piece of * * at the * began turning one tap after the other until the room was reduced to complete darkness but what do you mean now jules screamed the old lady again pardon madame answered jules with dignity it is an accident i thought there was one still lighted an accident an accident do you think i hire you to perform accidents for me you are just through telling me that it was accident made you give me both soup and gumbo for dinner today but accidents can always happen madame persisted jules adhering to his position the chandelier a design of originality in its day gave light by what * to be wax candles standing each in a circlet of pendent * the usual smile of * admiration spread over * features as he touched the match to the * wicks and lighted into life the rainbows in the prisms underneath it was a smile that did not * the intelligence of his features revealing as it did the * condition of his gums what will madame have for her dinner tomorrow looking benignantly at his mistress and still standing under his * do i ever give orders for one dinner with the other one still on my lips i only asked madame there is no harm in asking he walked away his long stiff white apron rattling like a petticoat about him catching sight of the visitor still standing at the threshold oh madame here is mr horace shall i let him in idiot every wednesday you ask me that question and every wednesday i answer the same way dont you think i could tell you when not to let him in without your asking oh well madame one never knows it is always safe to ask the appearance of the gentleman started a fresh subject of excitement jules jules you have left that front door unlocked again excuse me said mr horace jules did not leave the front door unlocked it was locked when i rang and he locked it again most carefully after letting me in i have been standing outside all the while the gas was being extinguished and * ah very well then and what is the news she sank into her armchair pulled her little * closer and began shuffling the cards upon it for her game of solitaire i never hear any news you know she nodding toward me goes out but she never * anything she is as stupid tonight as an empty bottle after a few passes her hands which were slightly tremulous regained some of their wonted steadiness and brilliancy of movement and the cards dropped rapidly on the table mr horace as he had got into the habit of doing watched her mechanically rather * * what he imagined would interest her from his weeks observation and hearsay and madames little world revolved complete for her in time place and personality it was an oldfashioned square room with long ceiling and broad low windows heavily curtained with stiff silk brocade faded by time into * the tall * mantel carried its obligation of ornaments well a gilt clock which under a glass case related some brilliant poetical * and told the hours only in an insignificant aside according to the delicate politeness of bygone french taste flanked by duplicate * of the same * in companion candelabra also under glass svres or imitation svres vases and a crowd of smaller objects to which age and * were slowly contributing an artistic value an oval mirror behind threw * of them into another mirror receiving in exchange the reflected portrait of madame in her youth and in the partial * in which innocence was * in madames youth there were besides mirrors on the other three walls of the room all hung with such careful intent for the exercise of their vocation that the apartment in spots extended indefinitely the brilliant chandelier was thereby * and the furniture and ornaments multiplied everywhere and most unexpectedly into twins and * producing such * among them and forcing such * between inanimate objects with such hospitable insistence that the effect was full of gaiety and life although the interchange in reality was the mere repetition of one original a kind of * echo the portrait of monsieur madames handsome young husband hung out of the circle of radiance in the isolation that wherever they hang always seems to surround the portraits of the dead old as the parlors appeared madame * them by the sixteen years she had lived before her marriage which had been the occasion of their * she had traveled a considerable distance over the sands of time since the epoch * by the portrait indeed it would require almost * evidence to prove that she who now was arriving at eighty was the same * that had started out so buoyantly at sixteen instead of a cap she wore black lace over her head pinned with gold * her white hair curled naturally over a low forehead her complexion showed * powder her eyes were still bright not with the * intelligence of old age but with actual * she wore a loose black sack * in purple and over that a black lace mantle fastened with more gold * she played her game of solitaire rapidly impatiently and always won for she never hesitated to cheat to get out of a tight place or into a favorable one * with the * of a flash and forgetting it the moment afterward mr horace was as old as she but he looked much younger although his dress and appearance betrayed no evidence of an effort in that direction whenever his friend cheated he would invariably call her attention to it and as usual she would * her shoulders and say bah lose a game for a card and pursue the conversation he happened to mention * mushrooms she threw down her cards before the words were out of his mouth and began to call jules jules mr horace pulled the * but madame was too excitable for that means of communication she ran into the * and put her head over the * calling jules jules louder and louder she might have heard * slippered feet running from the street into the corridor and upstairs had she not been so deaf he appeared at the door but where have you been here i have been raising the house a halfhour calling you you have been in the street i am sure you have been in the street madame is very much mistaken answered jules with resentful dignity he had taken off his white apron of waiter and was * in all the * of his attire as cook when madame forbids me to go into the street i do not go into the street i was in the kitchen i had fallen asleep what does madame desire smiling * what is this i hear fresh mushrooms in the market eh madame fresh mushrooms in the market and you have not brought me any madame there are fresh mushrooms everywhere in the market waving his hand to show their universality everybody is eating them old * jules continued only this morning offered me a plate piled up high for ten cents idiot why did you not buy them if madame had said so but madame did not say so madame said soup jules carrots rice counting on his fingers and the gumbo i have explained that that was an accident madame said soup * his menu again madame never once said mushrooms but how could i know there were mushrooms in the market do i go to market that is it and jules smiled at the question thus settled if you had told me there were mushrooms in the market pursued madame * in treating jules as a reasonable being why did not madame ask me if madame had asked me surely i would have told madame yesterday caesar brought them to the * whole * for twentyfive cents i had to shut the door in his face to get rid of him triumphantly and you brought me yesterday those detestable peas ah * his shoulders madame told me to buy what i saw i saw peas i bought them well understand now once for all whenever you see mushrooms no matter what i ordered you buy them do you hear no madame surely i cannot buy mushrooms unless madame orders them madames disposition is too quick but i do order them stupid i do order them i tell you to buy them every day and if there are none in the market every day go away get out of my sight i do not want to see you ah it is unendurable i * must get rid of him this last was not a threat as jules knew only too well it was merely a habitual exclamation during the colloquy mr horace leaning back in his armchair raised his eyes and caught the reflected portrait of madame in the mirror before himthe reflection so much softer and prettier so much more * than the original painting indeed seen in the mirror that way the portrait was as refreshing as the most charming memory he pointed to it when madame with considerable loss of temper regained her seat it is as beautiful as the past he explained most unnaturally for he and his friend had a horror of looking at the long long past which could not fail to remind them * no one cares to contemplate out of church making an effort toward some determination which a subtle observer might have noticed weighing upon him all the evening he added and apropos of the past * interrogated the old lady impatiently still under the influence of her * about the mushrooms he moved his chair closer and bent forward as if his communication were to be confidential ah bah speak louder she cried one would suppose you had some secret to tell what secrets can there be at our age she took up her cards and began to play there could be no one who bothered herself less about the forms of politeness yes yes answered mr horace throwing himself back into his chair what secrets can there be at our age the remark seemed a * one to him he gave himself up to it one must evidently be the age of ones thoughts mr * thoughts revealed him the old man he was the lines in his face deepened into wrinkles his white mustache could not pretend to conceal his mouth * by the loss of a tooth or two and the long thin hand that propped his head was crossed with blue distended veins at the last * was a favorite quotation with himthe book of our conscience will be read aloud before the whole company but the old lady deep in her game paid no more heed to his quotation than to him he made a gesture toward her portrait when that was painted josephine madame threw a glance after the gesture the time was so long ago the mythology of greece hardly more distant at eighty the golden age of youth must indeed appear an evanescent myth madames ideas seemed to take that direction ah at that time we were all * and you all * * and * yes but there was one among us who was a god with you all the * frequent one with mr * to madames husband who in his day it is said had indeed played the god in the little * of society she shrugged her shoulders the truth is so little of a compliment the old gentleman sighed in an abstracted way and madame although apparently absorbed in her game lent her ear it is safe to say that a woman is never too old to hear a sigh wafted in her direction josephine do you * your memory she pretended not to hear remember who ever heard of her forgetting but she was not the woman to say at a moments notice what she remembered or what she forgot a womans memory when i think of a womans * fact i do not like to think of a womans memory one can intrude in imagination into many places but a womans memory mr horace seemed to lose his thread it had been said of him in his youth that he wrote * it was said against him it was evidently such lapses as these that had given rise to the accusation and as there was no one less impatient under sentiment or poetry than madame her feet began to agitate themselves as if jules were * some of his * * before her and a mans memory totally misunderstanding him it is not there that i either would penetrate my friend a man when madame began to talk about men she was prompted by imagination just as much as was mr horace when he talked about women but what a difference in their sentiments and yet he had received so little and she so much from the subjects of their inspiration but that seems to be the way in * in imagination that you * paused with the curious * of the old before the word * you two * natural inevitable at the time tradition records exactly the same comment by society at the time on the marriage in question society is ever * in its comments but the * * we not sometimes i wonder perform them as jules does his accidents ah do not talk about that idiot an idiot born and bred i wont have him about me he is a * i tell his grandmother that every day when she comes to comb me what a * a ridiculous farce comfortable existence has become with us fresh mushrooms in market and bring me carrots the old gentleman partly from long knowledge of her habit or from an equally persistent bend of his own quietly held on to his idea one cannot tell it seems so at the time we like to think it so it makes it easier and yet looking back on our future as we once looked forward to it eh but who wants to look back on it my friend who in the world wants to look back on it one could not doubt madames energy of opinion on that question to hear her voice we have done our future we have performed it if you will our future it is like the dinners we have eaten of course we cannot remember the good without becoming exasperated over the bad * her * we cannot beat the cooks we must submit to fate forcing a queen that she needed at the critical point of her game at sixteen and twentyone it is hard to realize that one is arranging ones life to last until sixty seventy forever correcting himself as he thought of his friend the dead husband if madame had ever possessed the art of selfcontrol it was many a long day since she had exercised it now she frankly began to show ennui when i look back to that * horace leaned back in his chair and half closed his eyes perhaps to avoid the expression of her * see nothing but lights and flowers i hear nothing but music and laughter and * and flowers and music and * to meet in this room where we met so often to arrange our * the word appeared to attract him * a sudden change of voice and * how beautiful you were the old lady nodded her head without looking from her cards they used to say with sad conviction of the truth of his * men used to say that your beauty was irresistible none ever withstood you none ever could that after all was mr * great charm with madame he was so faithful to the illusions of his youth as he looked now at her one could almost feel the * of which he spoke it was only their excuse perhaps we could not tell at the time we cannot tell even now when we think about it they said then talking as men talk over such things that you were the only one who could remain yourself under the circumstances you were the only one who could know who could will under the circumstances it was their theory men can have only theories about such things his voice dropped and he seemed to drop too into some * of thought madame looked into the mirror where she could see the face of the one who alone could retain her presence of mind under the circumstances suggested by mr horace she could also have seen had she wished it among the reflected * of the mantel the corner of the frame that held the picture of her husband but peradventure * it with the past which held so many * bad dinners she never thought to link it even by a look with her emotions of the present indeed it had been said of her that in past present and future there had ever been but the one picture to interest her * one she was looking at now this however was the remark of the uninitiated for the true passion of a beautiful woman is never so much for her beauty as for its * as the passion of a * is for his game not for his luck how beautiful she was it was apparently down in the depths of his * that he found the connection between this phrase and his last and it was evidently to himself he said it madame however heard and understood too in fact traced back to a certain period her thoughts and mr * must have been fed by pretty much the same subjects but she had so carefully * certain issues in her memory as almost to obstruct their flow into her life if she were a cook one would say that it was her bad dinners which she was trying to keep out of remembrance you there he there she there i there he pointed to the places on the carpet under the chandelier he could have touched them with a walkingstick and the recollection seemed just as close she was in truth what we men called her then it was her eyes that first suggested * the little blue flower the * it suited her better than her own name we always called her that among ourselves how beautiful she was he leaned his head on his hand and looked where he had seen her * long such an eternity ago it must be explained for the benefit of those who do not live in the little world where an allusion is all that is necessary to put one in full possession of any drama domestic or social that mr horace was speaking of the * of madame when the bridal party stood as he described under the chandelier the bride and groom with each ones best friend it may be said that it was the last night or time that madame had a best friend of her own sex social gossip with characteristic kindness had furnished reasons to suit all tastes why madame had ceased that night to have a best friend of her own sex if gossip had not done so society would still be left to its imagination for information for madame never tolerated the smallest appeal to her for enlightenment what the general taste seemed most to relish as a version was that madame in her marriage had triumphed not conquered and that the night of her wedding she had realized the fact and to be frank had realized it ever since in short madame had played then to gain at love as she played now to gain at solitaire and hearts were no more than cards to * bah lose a game for a card must have been always her motto it is hard to explain it delicately enough for these are the most delicate affairs in life but the image of myosotis had passed through * heart and myosotis does mean forget me not and madame well knew that to love monsieur once was to love him always in spite of jealousy doubt distrust nay unhappiness for to love him meant all this and more he was that kind of man they said whom women could love even against conscience madame never forgave that moment her friend at least she could put aside out of her intercourse unfortunately we cannot put people out of our lives god alone can do that and so far he had interfered in the matter only by removing monsieur it was known to notoriety that since her wedding madame had abandoned destroyed all knowledge of her friend and the friend she had disappeared as much as is possible for one in her position and with her duties what there is in blue eyes light hair and a fragile form to impress one i cannot tell but for us men it seems to me it is blueeyed * and * women that are the hardest to forget the less easy to forget corrected * paid no attention to the remark they are the women that attach themselves in ones memory if necessary to keep from being forgotten they come back into ones dreams and as life rolls on one wonders about * she happy is she miserable goes life well or ill with her madame played her cards slowly one would say for her * and there is always a pang when as one is so wondering the response * is the certainty in ones heart * is miserable and life goes ill with her then if ever men envy the power of god madame threw over the game she was in and began a new one such women should not be unhappy they are too fragile too sensitive too trusting i could never understand the infliction of misery upon them i could send death to them but * misfortune madame forgetting again to cheat in time and losing her game began impatiently to * her cards for a new deal and yet do you know josephine those women are the unhappy ones of life they seem predestined to it as * at madames * * predestined to triumph and victory * in his abstraction of the personal nature of his * know how to handle their cards and they always play a losing game ha came from madame startled into an irate ejaculation it is their love always that is sacrificed their hearts always that are bruised one might say that god himself favors the * ones as his voice sank lower and lower the room seemed to become * and * a passing vehicle in the street however now and then drew a shiver of sound from the pendent prisms of the chandelier she was so slight so fragile and always in white with blue in her hair to match her * knows what in her heart all the time and yet they stand it they bear it they do not die they live along with the strongest the happiest the most fortunate of us bitterly * his eyes to his old friend who thereupon immediately began to * her * in the street i see a poor bent broken womans figure i know without verifying it any more by a glance that it is the wreck of a fair womans figure whenever i hear of a bent broken existence i know without asking any more that it is the wreck of a fair womans life poor mr horace spoke with the * of a superstitious * i have often thought since in large assemblies particularly in weddings josephine of what was going on in the womens hearts there and i have felt sorry for them and when i think of gods knowing what is in their hearts i have felt sorry for the men and i often think now * oftener and oftener of itthat if the resurrection trumpet of our childhood should sound some day no matter when out there over the old st louis cemetery and we should all have to rise from our long rest of oblivion what would be the first thing we should do and though there were a god and a heaven awaiting * that same god josephine i believe that our first thought in awakening would be the last in * that our first rush would be to the feet of one another for forgiveness for there are some * that must * the longest oblivion and a forgiveness that will be more necessary than gods own then our hearts will be bared to one another for if as you say there are no secrets at our age there can still be less cause for them after death his voice ended in the faintest whisper the table crashed over and the cards flew widespread on the floor before we could recover madame was in the * screaming for jules one would have said that from her face the old lady had witnessed the resurrection described by mr horace the rush of the spirits with their burdens of remorse the one to the feet of the other and she must have seen herself and her husband with a unanimity of purpose never apparent in their short married life rising from their common tomb and hastening to that other tomb at the end of the alley and falling at the feet of the one to whom in life he had been recreant in love she in friendship of course jules answered through the wrong door rushing in with his * and turning off the gas in a moment we were involved in darkness and dispute but what does he mean what does the idiot mean he it was impossible for her to find a word to do justice to him and to her exasperation at the same time pardon madame it is not i it is the cathedral bell it is ringing nine oclock but madame can hear it herself listen we could not see it but we were conscious of the benign * smile spreading over his face as the * fell in the room but it is not the gas i pardon madame but it is the gas madame said jules put out the gas every night when the bell rings madame told me that only last night the bell rings i put out the gas will you be silent will you listen if madame wishes just as madame says but the old lady had turned to mr horace horace you have * know and it was a question now of * emotion * carriage my friend a carriage madame jules interrupted his smile to interrupt her she was walking around the room picking up a shawl here a lace there for she was always prepared against draughts madame continued jules pursuing her a carriage if madame would only listen i was going to * madame is too quick in her * carriage has been waiting since a long hour ago mr horace said to have it there in a half hour it was then she saw for the first time that it had all been prepared by mr horace the rest was easy enough getting into the carriage and finding the place of which mr horace had heard as he said only that afternoon in it on her bed of illness poverty and suffering lay the patient wasted form of the beautiful fair one whom men had called in her youth myosotis but she did not call her myosotis mon amour the old pet name although it had to be * across more than half a century of * flashed like lightning from madames heart into the dim chamber ma divine came in * from the curtained bed in the old days women or at least young girls could hazard such pet names one upon the other * of * from the first communion class the dating period of so much of friendship my poor amour my poor poor divine the voices were together close beside the pillow ii began divine it could not have happened if god had not wished it interrupted poor amour with the resignation that comes alas only with the last drop of the bitter cup and that was about all if mr horace had not slipped away he might have noticed the curious absence of * name and of his own name in the murmuring that followed it would have given him some more ideas on the subject of woman at any rate the good god must thank him for having one affair the less to arrange when the trumpet sounds out there over the old st louis cemetery and he was none too premature for the old st louis cemetery as was shortly enough proved was a near reach for all three of the old friends every day every day it was the same overture in madame jouberts room in the institute st denis the * * * places * pre qui est dans le * a fait ce * its pupasse madame its pupasse the answer invariably was unanimous but madame * assure you madame * could not help it they know i could not help it by this time the fresh new fools cap made from yesterdays bee would have been pinned on her head quelle injustice quelle injustice this last * in a high whining nasal voice always procured pupasses elevation on the tall * stool in the corner it was a theory of the little girls in the primary class that madame joubert would be much more lenient to their own little * of bad conduct and lessons if pupasse did not invariably comb her the wrong way every morning after prayers by dropping something or * or * therefore while they * got together books slates and * their infantile eyes found time to dart deadly reproaches toward the corner of penitence and their little lips still shaped from their first nourishment * anything but sympathy for the occupant of it indeed it would have been a most startling * to have ever entered madame jouberts room and not seen pupasse in that corner on that stool her tall figure shooting up like a post until her tall pointed bonnet d ne came within an inch or two of the ceiling it was her * that best testified to her height it was the period of those * hoopskirts that spread out with such nice mathematical proportions from the waist down that it seemed they must have emanated from the brains of * like the * and * and other things belonging to the heavenly bodies pupasse could not have come within three feet of the wall with her * distended to have forced matters was not to be thought of an instant so even in her greatest grief and indignation she had to pause before the * black stool and gather up steel after steel of her circumference in her hands behind until her calico skirt * and * and so she could manage to accommodate herself to the limited space of her punishment the circles drooping far over her feet as she stood there looking like the * stick of a babys rattle her * continued into her face which unfortunately had nothing in the way of toilet to assist it two little black eyes fixed in the sides of a mere fence of a nose and a mouth with the shape and expression of all mouths made to go over * teeth planted very far apart the smallest amount possible of fine dry black * perfect * when it was plaited in one as almost all wore their hair but sometimes pupasse took it into her head to * it in two braids as none but the * ventured to wear it as the little girls said it was a petition to heaven for * * when * the hairdresser came at her regular periods to visit the hair of the boarders she would make an effort with pupasse * her hundred hairs in a * braid the effect was a half yard of black worsted * nothing more or better had pupasse possessed as many heads as the * she could have * them all with fools caps during one mornings recitations she entirely monopolized the daily bee madame joubert was forced to borrow from madame the stale weekly * des * for the rest of the room from grammar through sacred history arithmetic geography mythology down to dictation pupasse could pile up an accumulation of * that would have * the limits of the current day had not recreation been wisely set as a term which * by * previous * but even after recreation with that days lessons safely out punished and * pupasses doom seemed scarcely lightened there was still a whole criminal code of conduct to * the only difference was that instead of books slates or * leathern medals bearing various legends and * were hung around her * * decoration worse than the books for humiliation the * their torment for the day over thankful for any distraction from the next days lessons and eager for any relief from the intolerable ennui of goodness were thankful enough now for pupasse they naturally watched her in preference to madame joubert holding their books and slates quite cunningly to hide their faces pupasse had not only the genius but that which sometimes fails genius the means for * little eyes long nose foolish mouth and pointed tongue and she was so amusing when madame jouberts head was turned that the little girls being young and innocent would forget themselves and all burst out laughing it sounded like a flight of singing birds through the hot close stupid little room but not so to madame joubert young ladies but what does this mean and * the innocents would call out with one voice its pupasse madame its pupasse who made us laugh there was nothing but fools caps to be gained by * and there was frequently nothing less gained by confession and oh the wails and the sobs as the innocents would be stood up one by one in their places even the * at the backs of their little heads were convulsed with grief oh how they hated pupasse then when their * came for them at three * their tearstained faces at the * before daring to take them through the * passionately they would cry out the tears breaking afresh into the wet handkerchiefs its that pupasse its that * pupasse to pupasse herself would be meted out that * * et * that * of humiliation and disgrace so intensely horrible that many a little girl in that room solemnly averred and believed she would kill herself before submitting to it pupasses voluminous calico skirt would be gathered up by the hem and tied up over her head oh the horrible * on the stool in the corner then there were no eyes in that room that had any desire to look upon it and the cries and the quelle injustice that fell on the ears then from the hidden feelings had all the * of the unseen but heard and all the other girls in the room in fear and trembling would begin to move their lips in a perfect whirlwind of study or write violently on their slates or begin at that very instant to rule off their * for the next days * * name was marie pupasse but no one thought of calling her anything but pupasse with emphasis on the first syllable and * on the * no parents only a grandmother to describe whom all that is necessary to say is that she was as short as pupasse was tall and that her face resembled nothing so much as a little yellow apple * from decay the old lady came but once a week to fetch pupasse fresh clothes and a great brown paper bag of nice things to eat there was no boarder in the school who received handsomer bags of cake and fruit than pupasse and although not two hours before a girl might have been foremost in the shrill cry it is pupasse who made the noise it is pupasse who made me laugh there was nothing in that paper bag reserved even from such a one when the girl herself with native delicacy would under the circumstances judge it discreet to refuse pupasse would plead oh but take it to give me pleasure and if still the refusal continued pupasse would take her bag and go into the * in the corner of the garden and cry until the * one would * but the first offering of the bag was invariably to the stern * of fools caps and the * humiliation of the reversed skirt madame joubert pupasse was in the fifth class the * * the lowest in the school green was the color of the fifth * the * exhibition after exhibition the same green sash and green ribbons appeared on pupasses white muslin the white muslin getting longer and longer every year trying to keep up with her * growth and always from all over the room buzzed the audiences suppressed merriment at pupasses appearance in the ranks of the little ones of nine and ten it was that very merriment that brought about the greatest change in the institute st denis the sitting order of the classes was reversed the first * * up to the top step of the * and the little ones put on the lowest behind the pianos the graduates grumbled that it was not comme il faut to have young ladies of their position stepping like camels up and down those great steps and the little girls said it was a shame to hide them behind the pianos after their * had taken so much pains to make them look pretty but madame * also to natural history for her * one must be a * to continue the former routine religion cannot be kept waiting forever on the intelligence it was always in the fourth class that the first communion was made that is when the girls stayed one year in each class but pupasse had spent three years in the sixth class and had already been four in the fifth and madame joubert felt that longer delay would be disrespectful to the good lord it was true that pupasse could not yet distinguish the ten commandments from the seven capital sins and still would answer that jeanne * was the * of the little sisters of the poor but as madame joubert always said in the little address she made to the catechism class every year before handing it over to father * god judged from the heart and not from the mind father * his face he would have been an able * of bonnets * with pupasse if subjected to madame jouberts * had the same method of judging as god although the catechism class said they could dance a * on the end of his long nose without his perceiving it there is always a little air of mystery about the first communion not that there is any in reality but the little ones assume it to render themselves important the going to early mass the holding their * * as if they were relics the instruction from the priest even if he were only old father * all put such a little air of devotion into their faces that it imposed as it did every year upon their companions which was a vastly gratifying effect no matter how young and innocent she may be a womans devotion always seems to have two * and her own sex the week of retreat came oh the week of retreat that was the bonne bouche of it all for themselves and for the others it was the same every year by the time the week of retreat arrived interest and mystery had been * to the point of indiscretion so that the little girls would stand on tiptoe to peep through the shutters at the * inside and even the larger girls to whom first communion was a thing of an infantile past would condescend to listen to their reports with * indifference as the day of the first communion neared the day of the general confession naturally neared too leading it and then the little girls peeping through the shutters and holding their breath to see better saw what they beheld every year but it was always new and * * in corners with * on scraps of paper consultations * * the list of their sins of all the sins of their lives ma * and * * outside would shudder oh mon dieu to have to confess * all your sins as for me it would kill me sure and the frightful * of their consciences would make all instantly * and cross themselves and look at pupasses sins oh but they are long ma * but look but look i ask you at them the longest record was of course the most complimentary and honorable to the possessor as each girl naturally worked not only for * but for fame between * and instructions madame joubert would have la vie des saints read aloud to stimulate their piety and to engage their thoughts for the thoughts of first * are worse than flies for buzzing around the forbidden the lecture must have been a great * of conscience for they would dare punishment and cheat madame joubert under her own eyes in order * to add a new sin to their list of course the one hours recreation could not afford time enough for observation now and the little girls were driven to all sorts of excuses to get out of the * for one moments peep through the shutters at which whole * of them would sometimes be caught and sent into punishment only two days more madame joubert put them through the rehearsal a most important part of the preparation almost as important as * to enter the church how to hold the candle how to advance how to kneel * in fact only one day more the * most * day of all pupasse lost her sins of course every year the same accident happened to some one but it was a new accident to pupasse and such a long list the commotion inside that retreat pupasses nasal * carrying her lament without any mystery to the outside garden such searching of pockets * of corners microscopic examination of the floor such crimination and recrimination * * assurances backed by divine and saintly * pupasse accused companion after companion of * her sins which each after each would violently deny producing each her own list from her own * to conviction of innocence and we may say of guilt also pupasse declared they had * it to copy because her list was the longest and most complete she could not go to confession without her sins she could not go to communion without confession the tears rolled down her long thin nose unchecked for she never could remember to use her handkerchief until reminded by madame joubert she had committed it to memory as all the others had done theirs but how was she to know without the list if she had not forgotten something and to forget one thing in a general confession they knew was a mortal sin i shall tell madame joubert i shall tell madame joubert ma * whispered the little ones outside oh but look at them * * les * cents * which is equivalent to cutting up like the mischief and with reason as if such an * of the world upon them at this moment were not sufficient of itself to damn them but to tell madame joubert with all their dresses made and ready wreaths veils candles * * * prayerbeads and festival breakfasts with admiring family and friends prepared tell madame joubert she would simply cancel it all in a body they * but pupasse * pupasse * pupasse i assure you pupasse on the cross pupasse ah pupasse we implore you pupasse the only * and i shall tell madame joubert consultations * individual appeals general * pupasse stood in the corner curiously she always sought refuge in the very sanctum of punishment her face hidden in her * arms her hoops standing out behind * nothing but tears and the promise to tell madame joubert and three oclock approaching and madame joubert imminent but pupasse really could not go to confession without her sins they all recognized that they were reasonable as they assured her a crisis * the wits they heard the cathedral clock strike the quarter to three they whispered suggested * in the farthest corner from pupasse console yourself pupasse we will help you pupasse say no more about it we will help you a delegate was sent to say that she was only four feet and a half high and had to stand on tiptoe to pluck the * pupasses dress to gain her attention and they did help her generously a new sheet of * was procured and torn in two * and pinned in a long strip one by one each little girl took it and retiring as far as possible would put her hand into her pocket and extracting her list would copy it in full on the new paper then she would fold it down and give it to the next one until all had written here pupasse here are all our sins we give them to you you can have them pupasse was radiant she was more than delighted and the more she read the better pleased she was such a handsome long list and so many sins she had never thought * dreamed of she set herself with zeal to commit them to memory but a hand on the * joubert you never could have told that those little girls had not been sitting during the whole time with their hands clasped and eyes cast up to the ceiling or moving their lips as the prayerbeads glided through their fingers their versatility was really marvelous poor pupasse god solved the dilemma of her education and madames increasing sensitiveness about her appearance in the fifth class by the death of the old grandmother she went home to the funeral and never * at least she returned but only for madame there was a little scene in the parlor pupasse all dressed in black with her bag of primary books in her hand ready and eager to get back to her classes and fools caps madame hesitating between her interests and her fear of ridicule madame joubert between her loyalty to school and her conscience pupasse the only one free and untrammeled simple and direct that little school parlor had been the stage for so many scenes madame joubert detested * comedy as she called it there was nothing she punished with more pleasure up in her room and yet pupasse ma fille give me your grammar the old battered primitive book was gotten out of the bag the string still tied between the leaves for convenience in hanging around the neck your last punishment the rule for irregular verbs commence i know it madame joubert i know it perfectly i assure you commence irregular * i assure you i know iti know it by heart commence ma fille irregular * * know it madame * moment and she shook her right hand as girls do to get inspiration they say irregular * me one word madame joubert only one word that irregular verbs * verbs that see here pupasse you do not know that lesson any more than a cat * jouberts favorite comparison yes i do madame joubert yes i do silence but madame joubert will you be silent yes madame joubert only pupasse one more * madame joubert was forgetting her * pupasse and obey you go home and learn that lesson when you know it you can * your class that is the punishment i have thought of to correct your want of attention that was the way madame joubert put * of attention pupasse looked at * madame a silent but potent spectator to be sent from home because she did not know the rule of the irregular verbs to be sent from home family * that was the way pupasse put it she had been in that * may only be * years madame joubert knew it so did madame although they accounted for only four or five years in each class that school was her home madame * help * mother madame her divinity fools caps and * skirts her life the old * it was who had done everything for her a cidevant * they say she it was who was nothing to her madame must have felt something of it besides the loss of the handsome salary for years from the little old withered

fluttering of fools caps in that * bees and weekly couriers by the * what could pupasse say or do it settled the question as madame joubert assured madame when the tall thin black figure with the bag of books disappeared through the gate madame joubert was never known to break her word that is all one knows about her part of the bargain one day not three years ago ringing a bell to inquire for a servant a familiar murmuring fell upon the ear and an old * eyes could not resist the temptation to look through the shutters there sat pupasse there was her old grammar there were both fingers stopping her * all studious girls do or used to do and there sounded the old words composing the rule for irregular verbs and you all remember how long it is since we wore * hoopskirts
