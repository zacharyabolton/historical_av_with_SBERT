with the passing away of the olden rgime and the dawning of the new day of business enterprise in the southland many beautiful things have been lost in the dim past the * phrase before the war brings back pictures far brighter than any which the * time has ever hung upon the walls of memory the reminiscence of the faraway life lingers with us like the fragrance of the snowy * the * which once trailed over the walls of the old plantation home yet creep through the lattice of the heart and sparkle in the dews of lifes early morning when the bells across the snow ring out the holy chime of peace on earth good will to men the heart of the traveler turns back to the home of his childhood where those bells first made music in his * soul whether that * spot be amid the * pines of the north the flowering * of the south beyond the towering mountains of the west or across the seas that must ever roll between the wanderer and that magic fairyland of home the musical chimes ring back to the olden happy days in the southern heart the sacred christmastide is linked with memories of the oldtime plantation the merrymaking of the affectionate simple * colored people to whom the christmas holidays were the great festival of the year the gratitude which lit up their dusky faces as they received their presents the joy of the * in the possession of their new toys time has no power to remove those pictures from the gallery of the heart thus good old jack returning after years of absence to the * home of his youth describes the old plantation yule log with its mystic blaze flaming

doorsteps of the quarter kitchen pulling down each others heads and whispering mysteriously into each others ears as the boxes and barrels one after the other were taken out and stored away there was the * of new orleans molasses suggesting the thick * of sugar at the bottom the long peaked loaves of white sugar under their thick blue * the cases of raisins and figs and dates and * and barrels of nuts and oranges and crackers and boxes of cheese and slyly pushed back behind them were hampers with the mysterious name of * which name we at once associated with santa claus we all loved and feared uncle charles who seemed to us the * and confidential agent of the king of childhood santa claus to the deft fingers of his wife mammy borry we owed many of our * gowns of drawn work and lace the blowing of horns and popping of firecrackers had made christmas many hours old when i was aroused by a loving * kiss and looking up saw the beautiful face of my grandmother bending over me rubbing my eyes awake i saw her holding out toward me a beautiful wadded dressing gown of blue and pink silk and a pair of warm worsted boots her christmas present for me putting on the boots and slipping the wrapper over my night gown she gave me a cup of hot milk to drink then pushing back my curls led me to the folding doors which at her touch opened wide was there ever before so weird and beautiful a picture colored on a little childs heart up in the top of a glittering christmas tree laden with presents for all was a great * santa claus and around about it the little negroes of the plantation were gracefully grouped on one of the branches in a nest of soft white cotton was a little colored baby six weeks old unconsciously holding in its chubby black fist a deed which made him * christmas

appreciate dats his way er * you chrismus gif my mammy apologetically explained as she took him from me the mother of kriss my christmas gift did not like children and was in the habit of lending out

and waved the dismissal of his impatient listeners the oldtime christmas of the plantation has passed away with the old southern homes and the old southern life the christmas sermon of good old uncle charles is now but a cherished memory in the hearts of the grave and saddened men and women who as children used to listen with awestruck minds to his solemn * the war soon came to sweep master and slave alike into a freedom which is thus commented upon by mammy borry aunt nettie or mammy borry for we always called her by her child borrowing name lived nearly two years after the war during the

side and read about the loaves and the fishes her favorite of all the chapters in the bible one night during the christmas of 1866 uncle charles tapped gently at ole missis door and said the memories of the last olden time plantation christmas of my youth spring into bud in my thought through the * shade of the years and i let them blossom into words merely as an historical sketch of the times hoping to please those who like me have passed through such scenes as well as those to whom they are not even the dimmest of reminiscences the story of that novel christmastide was enacted at my old virginia home near the village of * tuck in nansemond county the ancestral forests of this region had sheltered the hunting ground of the * indians in the days when john smith came prospecting for a home for his numerous descendants and from that circumstance he had given the county its name of nansemond my home was diagonally opposite newport news on a neck of land which separated the * tuck creek from the nansemond river from a point on the strait i witnessed the famous naval engagement between the monitor and the merrimac ever since the capture of roanoke island by the federals and the abandonment of norfolk and suffolk by the confederates all this part of the country had been in quiet possession of the former the confederate lines extended only to the blackwater river on the east where a small force under general pryor was stationed to hold the federals in check though the emancipation proclamation had not yet been issued the light of freedom was glimmering like an aurora * in the northern sky the negroes knew that they had only to cross beyond the reach of the power of the confederacy to throw off forever the shackles which had been riveted upon them by time custom and tradition alluring as was that radiance it was dimmed almost to * in their loving loyal hearts by the darkness of leaving their old homes tender memories ties of affection formed through many years of dependence and protection * their reluctant feet as they timidly crossed their * the hand of time had unlocked the * and a river of blood had rolled on and swept away the ancient barriers master and servitor alike drifted onward with the tide well dis is chrismus * * * will be chrismus * en day atter * chrismus day in de * i overheard aunt serena saying to herself though with anything but the wonted christmas glee in her usually cheery voice as i went into her kitchen all cleaned and ready for christmas the last finishing touches had been given to it and cedar wreaths and bright holly berries * adorned its whitewashed ceiling since we had no sugar in virginia sorghum an asiatic plant with * * recently introduced into this country from which we made a syrup had to serve all its purposes we ingeniously managed to * a great many things out of it that tasted very good to us then in those war starving times with the aid of our native * * cherries apples pears peaches figs * berries and * succeeded in making a delicious fruit cake the shelves in the old tin safe now were filled with sorghum * sorghum * sorghum cakes and sorghum * made into all manner of shapes some plain and others filled with * * and hickory nuts to me as i remember them all now in the long distance of time they looked very tempting and inviting in spite of the uncanny suggestion of a nigger santa claus the * quite an event on a virginia plantation had been over with for nearly two weeks and much of the time since then had been spent by us in preparing and sending off the christmas boxes for our loved ones across the lines besides the many * dainties which we put into these boxes there were * and * and * and cheese * and pigs feet and crackling bread and * and turkeys and pickled oysters and baked sweet potatoes yellow and white * all had been lovingly packed and smuggled safely across the blackwater upon the opposite banks of which the johnny rebs * tobacco for coffee with the yanks by this time their singing had cheered her in spite of herself and before they had begun this last verse she was standing in the doorway patting time to the music of their voices may weall look in de

christmas eve christmas eve had come and gone the stock had been fed early the cows * the supper was over the christmas presents were distributed the * had been popped and the last flicker of light from the burning * and tar barrel had died away my little brothers and sisters had been put to bed to give old santa claus a chance to come down the chimney with his * though they had all been told not to expect many things this war christmas because poor santa claus would have to run the blockade and could not get through the federal lines without risking his life in passing the yankee sentinels come said my father it is growing late and time to lock up and turn in all right said my father sadly and then he called them back and said do you know why i gave you your christmas suits and gifts this evening well it is because you are all going to leave your old masters home tonight i hoped you would come and tell me before you went here is a little change for each of you * will divide it equally and if you ever need a home come back to this the one that you and your fathers fathers before you helped to make i mean that i have read your minds and that your arrangements are all made to leave tonight i see that you are feeling very bad over it and i hoped to the last you would be straightforward and come and tell me so that you could have packed up and gone away in the open day and said goodbye honestly instead of * off like this in the night you know that ever since the evacuation of norfolk you could have gone at any time you wished and i could not have prevented you the manner of your going makes it hard to bear for both aint you got no tongue keep the money and remember what i have said now goodbye and dont hurt your souls by any more stories do not wound their feelings papa i plead by doubting them though in my heart i felt his intuitions were correct about an hour after this mary francis crept slowly to my bedside and put on my finger a little ring that miss mary hutchins had left her as a legacy there was a doll trunk which i had given her made of shells and in it were some little * very precious to her which she had stored away from time to time this she put under my pillow while a sob escaped her as she stole away thinking i was asleep and i would not * nor pain her a few minutes later arabella came in and accidentally stumbling against a chair said poor girl there were tears in her trembling voice as she thus sought to assure me that her last thought in parting from the old life was of the lil missis who had been the object of her loving care through their joint lives the * which she mentioned as * is the heart of the pine tree it gives a most brilliant and beautiful light though the black smoke is disagreeable at that time candles and oil were very scarce and * torch was the best substitute we had previous to the war the servants used it in the quarters and at the * and * their black faces gleaming out * in the glare as they danced and sang and shouted when morning dawned no chrismus gif chrismus gif sounded through the house as in the olden christmas mornings no cheery voices rang out from the quarters and * the sable servitors who had so earnestly protested their * loyalty the evening before had taken the midnight steamer from * neck and gone across to newport news leaving desolation behind them for marse da and all the family were deeply attached to the household servants as well as dependent upon them for personal services most of the field hands had gone long before but those who had just departed were like members of the family after we had eaten our sad christmas breakfast and tried to enjoy the delight of the little ones over their homemade babies with * heads and rag bodies and sorghum candy shaped into men and animals all of an african hue my father and i went down to the quarters to look around and lock them up just as we were returning mamma who had joined us called our attention to a pile of corn husks lying in the corner look what can that be i saw those husks move look look as they moved again the weak pitiful wail of a child came from among them * in her haste had left her * little thing we quickly but gently took the halfstarved half smothered little one out but alas it had not been left as we first supposed accidentally it was warmly wrapped in its blanket its clothes in a bundle beside it a barrel hoop was curved carefully around it to prevent its being smothered by the covers and a rag with * sweet potato and flag root tied up in it was in its mouth the little thing was only five weeks old and the mother instinct had been overcome by the apprehension of the care and inconvenience of taking so helpless a being on a difficult journey mamma carried the little waif into the house where we fed bathed and dressed it then we called the children and told them that we had a real live baby which old santa claus had left for them and as it belonged to them all together each one must feel the responsibility and care of it they were wild with delight and asked many questions about how old santa had evaded the yankee sentinels and why he had brought a black real baby and mulatto doll babies and black * and colored things was it for truly a black santa claus this year perhaps there never was an * more * little * than our charity as we named the christmas baby but neither was there ever one brighter or more cunning the possession of such a prize not only made that christmas day a happy one for the children but brought comfort and help to us all as the years came and went with the gentlest tenderest heart she ministered to the suffering whether of the human family or of the yet undeveloped tribe whose souls look * through eyes that silently question of the great mystery of pain the lambs which were motherless or ill fell to her care all the deserted little chickens and ducks appealed with irresistible force to her maternal heart and found a congenial home with her when a little calf chanced to be thrown helpless and unprotected on the shore of life it was at once adopted into her happy family all such waifs flourished under her fostering care and she became the owner of a herd of stock branded in her own name she accumulated a nice little bank account not only from the sale of her eggs and chickens but for the worth of her service which my father began to put to her credit when she was six years old charitys mother after fifteen years of * wandering accidentally learned of these possessions and through the aid of a wouldbe philanthropist came back and claimed her child we had all become tenderly attached to the little baby left us by old santa as a christmas gift to lighten that desolate morning long ago the dear little children who had come tome in the meantime were devoted to her and never wearied of her stories about brer * en de * de tar baby de * patch sis cow en brer * with the supernatural * of the undeveloped mind their favorite history was of the * negro who having stolen the dollars from a dead womans eyes was ever after pursued by an avenging phantom with ghastly * flapped open scare me to * charity scare me to * they would cry and would listen with delicious * of fascinated terror as she tragically recounted the tale of horror the passage of the years had increased her ugliness if possible and she was the blackest negro i ever saw her immense hands and feet thick lips flat nose and poppy eyes her short upper lip rolled back showing her little short teeth just coming outside of her gums and looking like two rows of * did not render her a thing of beauty nevertheless she was a perennial joy to our household although her mothers entreaties arguments and the tempting pictures she drew of city life were but slight attractions to her simple contented mind yet her intuitive sense of filial duty supported by the influence which our appreciation of the maternal claim impelled us to bring to bear upon the situation directed her to the new life which was offered her but here was home here were the memories of childhood here were all the associations of her loving gentle merry life here was the protection which had always shielded her from the unknown world terrifying in its mystery the battle of these opposing moral forces was the first conflict of her peaceful life she had reached the most tragic battleground of the soul the place where duty and pleasure part company as the tears streamed down her face she looked to my father for help she is your mother he said go with her but whenever you want to come back to us you shall come it was not a scene to arrest the attention of the dignified historian its figures might not have claimed the brush of the artist or the pen of the poet it was only a little black girl going out from under the roof which had sheltered her merry * contented life yet of all the black and white tragedies which the war had placed upon the stage of southern life none would appeal more strongly to a heart that had been bound by the olden ties of affection and mutual dependence once uniting the two races the chuckatuck packet answered the signal to stop the sound of her horn jarring * upon our hearts little charitys effects were put on board and the last farewells were said amid falling tears my father pulled his hat over his eyes and walked away the last view we had of our faithful loving little servitor was as she sat in solitary grief clasping her knees and rocking herself to and fro wailing i am very glad you had such a nice time i said but you have not told me anything about the bridegroom how did he look how perfectly dreadful i said why this seems almost * it is absolutely shocking that you could all have had such merriment when your friend for whose sake the feast was partly made had just met so horrible and tragic a death especially does it seem heartless in the bride to have entered into such festivities when her bridegroom was a corpse of a day i should think she would have folded up all her beautiful clothes and locked them away and spent the christmas eve in prayer and in weeping for her dead rather than laughing and dancing and marching and singing with the living * me ung charles * me echoed from a chorus of frightened voices and though the little ragged * as uncle charles called them each and all knew that there was no harm in doing any one of these things yet uncle charles threatening tone together with the fear of his disapproval * their innocent pastime into a heinous crime touch one of them if you dare i said i made this trash my little friends could not stand my humiliation and discomfort any longer and between their * acknowledged that they were the culprits we were always glad of the privilege of going to mammy borry but this time we hailed the opportunity with peculiar delight they say uncle charles used to whip all the children on the plantation when he caught them in stories or mischief or telling tales on one another i had often found a pleasure in observing the extreme care with which mammy borry kept her pretty little home simple as it was it far * in neatness and * many a grand mansion which i have since known the immaculate bed with its ruffled * and pillow shams and * smoothness of snowy * invited to sweet repose curtains of white * draped the windows and were drawn back in soft folds to give free entrance to the bars of light that the sun threw across the bright rag carpet which looked always as if it were just from the loom the * chairs held no threat of damage to the most delicate muslin gown fresh from the iron through the clear glass doors of the * i saw the strange many figured blue china which was at once the * and the delight of my childhood what remote and mysterious land could produce such wonderful blue trees with branches drooping earthward under the weight of a burden of blue leaves a perennial interest centered in the guileless * maiden with apron brimming over with variegated blue roses the astonishing * of the * boy filled my childish mind with bewilderment to apply those dishes to any of the ordinary purposes of

greatest number of strings by de time ung charles come ter hang em up * de back side er de cabin fer ter dry i can still feel the thrill of admiration with which we would gaze up at the * * fruit of

borrys fireplace no corn ever popped so white or even as that which she popped she tried in her own subtle way to point our little feet to the right path we never went in vain to her for help or sympathy one day when through our disobedience we had gotten into trouble with the overseers children and went to her to settle it she said out came our little crickets and down upon our knees we went mammy borry herself kneeling with clasped hands in front of her own chair now i lay me down to sleep we all began mammy borry took her hands down and looked around saying up went our little hands again and up went our trusting voices to our heavenly father saying over and over again with a few variations we prayed this prayer peeping through our fingers to see mammy borry take down her hand and give us the signal to rise it came with lawd we beseech * ter year de * er dese dy sinful chillun en lead dar hearts * de * en * * amen one rainy day on the eve of christ we had run the entire scale of our pleasures and grown weary of looking out of the windows at the sadeyed * cows with their clanking bells that sounded like mourning chimes through the heavy air the wet disconsolate drooping chickens each stood on one leg as if preparing to play * * crow the impatient * dog peeped out of his tub and the little birds fluttered their dripping feathers until we were tired of ourselves and everything we could see we begged mammy borry to tell us again though we had heard it so many times before about the golden crowns and the * lady and show us again her * and things yer is de ring she said and we each in succession tried it on all our fingers reluctantly giving it up then she took down the little box covered with shells and unlocked it and allowed us each in turn to try on the other treasures looking at them with caressing eyes she locked them up and began the ghost of my youth with palpitant wings sits this christmas eve in that clean little cottage with its snow white bed its * * its * cradle it looks into the great open fireplace where i used to see beautiful * of the worlds wonderful past and of my own deep wide high triumphant impossible future

other * combining the horns with the firecrackers of washingtons birthday and the fourth of july the easter monday eggs with the new years eggnogg and the goodies of thanksgiving it was the holiday of holidays especially to the plantation negro looking back through the long vista of years i recall the shifting scenes of the first christmas which impressed itself upon my baby mind and of all the mystic and unexpected delights which make up the blessings of childhood christmas had dawned upon a calm world spirited in white tall and tiny ghosts ghosts of * and tombstones of trees and violets stood as dazzling sentinels in the unbroken paths of this * earth peacefully smiling to a perfect * * and * with crystal fringes and anon glistening with green * beset in myriads of sparkling diamonds all shimmering and shining in the wealth of * * * rays presently the breathing stillness is broken a mingled chorus of voices childish mature and aged each however * with christmas glee and happy expectancy cut through the lines of jingling icicles glassy twigs and * boughs and was under voiced in the shrill * yet * blast of the christmas horn on which uncle charles my grandmothers foreman with great zeal and strong wind sounded the christmas reveille to muster the hands old and young uncle charles was a conspicuous figure and a noted character even in his day and * he looked like a priest with his round fat jovial face and sleek bald head he had a full set of false teeth and while he held a rather exaggerated admiration of his general external appearance and his moral beauty it paled in the vanity and pride which he felt in his false teeth worn more for ornament than use carried conspicuously on his watchchain grinning in a ghastly manner against his inherited black velvet vest on sundays and holidays and taken out too whenever he ate drank or talked he was a preacher and class leader and the * of hymns in his own congregation and sexton in the methodist church as well as foreman overseer for my grandmother thus with so many offices of importance his people of course held him in constant awe his manner except with children was always deliberate dignified and peculiar he never under any circumstances forgot himself into being perfectly * not even when on one occasion the barn caught on fire and he thought it his duty to acquaint my grandmother of the fact he gently tapped at her door and said * me missis fer * you up so * but de barn is on * well put it out she replied with perfect security and confidence on this particular christmas morning of which i am speaking all the plantation and house negroes little and big old and young all the dogs * and * the two pet * the * lamb and the vain inquisitive * had assembled and were standing in waiting before uncle charles had un puffed his fat jaws and taken the horn from his crowded mouth when he had made an instantaneous but shy inventory and seen that all his flock were present he took out his red bandanna shook out the folds and carefully wiped the horn inside and out and hung it up in its place on the porch then he rubbed polished and adjusted his spectacles slowly took out his teeth and wiping them with the same bandanna hitched them on to his big brass watchchain he then solemnly closed his eyes for a moment as if in deep and silent prayer opened them in a startled manner as if for the time he had been lost to the world and slowly raised both hands and * up the string behind his dwarfed ears which * in the little rim of * wool at the base of his bald head was attached to the bows of his spectacles looking * and * over the glasses for another moment he said with an * tragic air * his * words my old mammy had dressed me chattering the while of the mysteries of santa claus of the dangers of his many miles of travel of the prancing * and of the good things he had hung upon the christmas tree then my mammy took me down to the great room known as the office where the christmas * bound holly and * in the middle of the room a blaze of dazzling color and light an immense log fire burned in the huge hearth and shed its genial glow upon the toys and candles and upon the dusky faces of the * who came * in with a low courtesy and a gleeful chrismus gif chrismus gif and a blessing on me whom our good old uncle charles had taken from my mammy and was holding up in his arms towards the lights and the gifts so that i could take down a christmas present for each one then my beautiful grandmother with folded hands smiling at the happy grinning faces around her impressively reminded them of him who was born that day to bless them and how it was all in his name the christmas joy and gifts were made they all for their christmas enjoyment followed the bent of their own * and honey pulling * and * * and racing coon and rabbit hunting the entrapped old molly cotton tails set loose to be * though this time with a chance of escape and a knowledge of the bliss of * the midday christmas dinner presided over by my black mammy and uncle charles later in the day gay jokes and laughter floated across the long table about which our own united family were assembled how plainly i seethe roast pig with the orange in his mouth * pigs kin hab apples en * ebby day but come a chrismus * eben pigs mus hab sumpn * my mammy explained and the lurid flames of the plumpudding still burn brightly in my memory the night came * with silver * every breath and ripple of wind in christmas leash that the softest glee sound might not be broken the * was on his way the christmas gifts had all been * good things eaten the eggnogg had been drunk melodies and * and the shuffling and pattering of dancing feet mingled with the * of the banjo bones and fiddle floated from the negro quarters to the house soon old mammy and her * uncle charles and his * grinning teeth the myriad of black faces the * lamb the goats and dogs the * and the rabbits the peacocks gorgeous * tails and * santa claus my dear beautiful grandmother and the blessed babe in the manger all got mixed up and came sliding * the peeping twinkling stars through the window on a * into the * tangle of shadows and danced around my trundle bed at last with my tender little heart full of * and unwavering faith in my * and santa claus my wee newborn soul borne on even by this first christmas influence to higher sentiments of love adoration faith and spiritual sympathy my christmas dolly clasped close in my arms in the sweetness and strength of that first subtle instinct the blessed sacred peace of motherhood my lips wreathed in mysterious smiles i * was over over and gone now are all my childhoods merry christmas days the tree with its beautiful burden of gifts and brilliant lights has withered away and died to become a perennial growth shining in * glory in memory uncle charles closed his eyes upon the world long ago but how often even now do i feel his strong clasp lifting me over the rough places in the pathway of life and holding me aloft where i can see the lights and gifts on the tree of life my quaint kind old mammy rocked me to sleep for the last time away back in my childhood but even yet i seem to feel her loving arms hold me to her bosom and * my tired feet the lovely face of my grandmother passed away from my sight years ago but when has there been a moment that it has not dwelt in the depths of my heart all gone and i stand alone and look upward at a great white star shining high in heaven the brightest and most beautiful of all the luminous globes in the wide expanse of radiant sky i wonder if it is the star that shone over the shepherds who watched their flocks by night i fix my eyes upon it with a longing that will not be denied it seems to draw nearer and nearer and to shine upon me with a tender glow how large and softly radiant it is it sends down to me long brilliant rays like beautiful white hands beckoning with irresistible love it * and deepens as if to fill all the world with light it bends over me with a tender pity it grows yet more intensely radiant and seems to open wide and form a doorway to heaven the illimitable space * with supernal light through the open doorway i see all the joys that i have lost on earth all the dear dead christmas days of my happy childhood the pets and playmates of my * past the loved and loving faces that have gone with me in memory through all my life good uncle charles dear dainty mammy borry and my own kind old mammy and my grandmothers dear sweet face lovely as in the old days all come to greet me on this christmas night above the * i see in starry letters the sweet inscription god is love
