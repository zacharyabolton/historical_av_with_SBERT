i open my volume up to that time i had gone with jacksons foot cavalry marching slowly and steadily to battle now i was to follow the gay and * career of the virginia * the * of the black * if you are willing to accompany me i promise to show you some * scenes you will hear stuart laugh as he * the charge or * with his staff or sing his gay cavalry songs but alas we shall not go far with him and when he leaves us a sort of shadow will fall upon the * from that may 1864 laughter will * be heard the light which * on the great picture will be red and * blood will * on desperate * will fall like dry leaves in the winds of autumn the crimson * will * away a whole * * the red cross flag will go down in blood the * of events will * us to petersburg and those last months which witnessed the final

lees old army is full of * and * thousand men * pennsylvania pennsylvania on a beautiful day of june 1863 the * of culpeper in virginia were the scene of an * * stuarts cavalry was passing in review before lee who was about to * his march toward gettysburg those of my readers who were fortunate enough to be present will not forget that scene they will remember the * form of stuart at the head of his * how the columns of * * by the great flag how the * * * eyes shone the merry * * the gay * rang how the horse artillery * as it was charged in * * lee the gray old soldier with * carriage sat his horse and looked on never had the fields of culpeper witnessed a spectacle more magnificent the sunshine * in * from the long line of * * up beautiful faces and flashed from * and waving * * cheeks and * * all was life and joy and * for once war seemed turned to * and flowers * the keen edge of the sword among the * figures gazed at by the crowd two were the observed of all the * of lee and stuart lee sat his powerful horse with its plain * * beneath the large flag he was * in a gray uniform almost without mark of rank cavalry * reached nearly to his knees as usual he wore no sword over his broad brow * a plain brown felt hat without * or * beneath you saw a pair of frank and * but * eyes * cheeks and an iron gray * and * both cut close in the * of the stately head as in the whole carriage of his person there was something calm august and * this man it was plain was not only great but * true * of the race of gentlemen of other times stuart the chief of cavalry of the army was altogether different in appearance young * full of life and * he was the true * of * said to be his * the dark cavalry * the lofty forehead and * blue eyes his little fighting * as he called it bright with * and * made a picture his * reached to the knee a yellow silk * was about his * his * of * gold were the present of some ladies of maryland and with * at * point extended over his horses head he led the charge with his staff in front of the column and laughing as though the notes of the * drove him forward in every movement of that * figure as in the glance of the blue eyes and the laughter * the huge * could be read youth and joy and a courage which nothing could * he was called a boy by some as * was before him but his federal * did not laugh at him they had felt his * too often nor did the soldiers of the army he had * * in front of infantry as well as the * in front of cavalry the * might laugh at * old soldiers found no fault in him for * his songs in battle they knew the man and felt that he was a good soldier as well as a great general he would have made an excellent private and did not feel above being one never was human being * if he did laugh and sing was he not brave answer old * whom he led in a hundred charges old * of jackson with whom he went over the breastworks at chancellorsville some readers may regard this picture of stuart as * but it is the simple truth of that brave soul he had his * he loved praise even * and was sometimes * i have never known a human being more pure generous and brave at sunset the review was over the long columns of cavalry moved slowly back to their camps the horse artillery followed the infantry who had witnessed the ceremony sought their * in the woods and the crowd on foot on horseback or in * returned toward the courthouse whose * were visible across the fields stuart had approached the * and * his * hat had * lee who * in return and * the review after a few moments conversation they had then * a second time lee followed by his staff rode toward his quarters and stuart set out to return to his own we had * about half a mile when stuart turned his head and called me i rode to his side i wish you would ride down toward * ford surry he said and tell * to keep a bright * tonight they must have heard our artillery on the other side of the river and may want to find out what it means i * and turned my horse stuart * on singing in a few minutes he was out of sight and i was riding toward the rappahannock if the reader has done me the honor to * the first volume of my * i * the * of * that he will like to be informed how i became a member of general stuarts staff when * * down they are * to * the * growing around them jackson was a very tall oak and i a very humble * when the great trunk fell the mere * disappeared i had served with jackson from the beginning of the war that king of battle dead at chancellorsville i had found myself without a commander and without a home i was not only called upon in that may of 1863 to * the * soldier who had done me the honor to call me his friend i had also to look around me for some other general some other position in the army i was * this important subject in my mind when i received a note from general * stuart jacksons friend and brother in arms come and see me said this note * hours afterward i was at stuarts headquarters near culpeper courthouse when i entered his tent or rather * of * stretched beneath a great oak stuart rose from the red * upon which he was lying and held out his hand as he gazed at me in silence i could see his face * you * me of jackson he said * my hand and * * at me i bowed my head making no other reply for the sight of stuart brought back to me also many memories the * of the valley the hard * of the * cold harbor manassas sharpsburg fredericksburg and that last * between jackson and the great commander of the cavalry on the * moonlight night at chancellorsville stuart continued to gaze at me and i could see his eyes slowly fill with tears it is a national * he * jacksons loss is * he remained for a moment * into my face then passing his hand over his forehead he * by a great effort these * memories his bold features resumed their * * our * was brief and came rapidly to the point have you been assigned to duty yet my dear surry i have not general would you like to come with me more than with any general in the army since jacksons death you know i am * in saying that * the matter can be very soon arranged i think i want another * and want you with these words stuart seated himself at his desk wrote a note which he * by a * to army headquarters and then throwing aside business he began laughing and talking for once the supply of red * in richmond seemed * exhausted stuart was lees right hand and when he made a request the war office * to listen four days afterward i was seated under the * of a staff tent when stuart hastened up with * * holding a paper here you are old * he used the * old to any ones name he was always * well disposed toward * richmond people are prompt this time here is your * for * and his * he shall play * the cavalry in honor of the occasion surry you see now my dear reader how it happened that in june 1863 stuart * to me and gave me an order to * to general * as i rode toward the rappahannock to * stuarts order to general * the wide * was suddenly * up by a crimson * i looked over my shoulder the sun was * upon the western woods and * a huge * eye above it extended a long black cloud like an * from the cloud issued low thunder when a storm is coming the * * * but the soldier carrying an order * his * around him and * on i went on past * and * hill * toward the river entered a great * of * night and storm * * an artillery * seemed going on in the clouds the * * amid the * * * of fire the wind rolled through the black wood * off * in its passage i pushed my horse to full speed to * from this scene of * * and * * i had just passed a little stream when from a * on my left came the * of * it is good to be on the watch in the cavalry and i * to the right * all at once a brilliant * of * showed me within fifty * a column of blue cavalry * rang out from the column and a * followed i did not * capture was becoming a * affair in june 1863 i passed across the head of the column at full speed followed by * struck into a * on the right and pushed ahead * pursued they had followed me nearly half a mile firing on me and * me to * when suddenly a * * * fifty yards in front of me and a moment afterward a * ball passed through my riding * i drove on at full speed * that these in front were friends and the * of my horse struck * against that of another in the darkness * or you are dead came in the same commanding voice another * of * showed me a * of gray cavalry at their head rode a * well mounted it was his horse against which i had struck and he held a * pistol to my breast the * left nothing in doubt gray and blue quickly recognized each other the blue cavalry had drawn * and at that moment the leader of the * * a rush of * and then a quick * of * followed the * had * together the wood suddenly became the scene of a violent combat it was a rough affair for ten minutes the result was * the federal cavalry were apparently commanded by an officer of excellent * and he fought his men * for nearly a quarter of an hour the wood was full of * * and * which mingled with the roll of the storm then the fight ended my friend of the * pistol threw himself * in hand upon the federal front and it shook and gave back and retreated the weight of the * seemed to * it * by * away the blue * finally broke and scattered in every direction the * pressed on with loud cheers firing as they did * minutes afterward the * wood had * * and pursued the whole had disappeared like * * in the direction of the rappahannock half an hour afterward the storm had spent its fury and i was standing by a * fire on the banks of the rappahannock * with the officer against whom i had driven my horse in the darkness mounted upon a powerful gray he had led the attack with a sort of fury and i now looked at him with some curiosity he was a man of about thirty of * face and figure wearing a hat with a black * and the uniform of a colonel of cavalry the features were regular and might have been called handsome the eyes hair * and * wore no * black the * so pale that the effect was * more curious than all else however was the officers expression in the lips and eyes could be read something bitterly * mingled with a profound and apparently * melancholy after looking at my new acquaintance for an instant i said to myself this man has either suffered some great grief or committed some great crime his bearing was cold but * i recognized you as soon as i saw you colonel he said in * to my * you probably do not know me however as i have just been * from the army of the west colonel mohun at your service i exchanged a pressure of the hand with colonel mohun or speaking more * i * his it did not return the pressure i then * him for his * appearance and he bowed * it was * that my * led me in this direction he said that party is * back over the river and will give us no more trouble * woods are full of their dead and wounded as he spoke he took a cigar case from his pocket and presented it will you smoke sir he said i bowed and selected a cigar colonel mohun * me and was about to * * when two or three cavalry men were seen approaching through the gloom apparently * some one as they drew nearer the figures became * in the * the cavalry men had in charge a female prisoner she was a woman of * figure * in a handsome gray * and mounted upon a * horse with rich * apparently belonging to a federal officer of high rank from the horse i glanced at the prisoners face it was a strange countenance she was about * * was dead white except the lips which were as red as * her eyes were large and brilliant her hair dark and worn plain under a small * in one * * hand she held the * of her * the other which was * she raised a lace * to her lips on the finger * a * there was something strange in the expression of this woman she looked dangerous in spite of her * she sat * at some one behind me with the * still raised to her lips then she took it away and i could see a smile upon them what was the * of that smile and at whom was she looking i turned and found myself face to face with colonel mohun his appearance almost frightened me his countenance wore the * of a * his whole frame shook with quick * and his eyes were * until the black * shone in the * of two white * suddenly his teeth * * he passed his hand over his forehead * with cold * and said in a low voice then you are not dead madam no sir the prisoner replied * mohun gazed at her with a long fixed look as he did so his features gradually resumed the cold and * expression which i had first observed in them this meeting is singular he said a * smile passed over the lips of the prisoner our last interview was very different was it not sir she said the * was higher than the rappahannock is tonight and you did not expect to meet me * soon mohun continued to gaze at her with the same fixed look no madam he said you recall that agreeable evening do you not sir mohun * * his head and you have not seen me since never madam you are mistaken is it possible that i could have forgotten so * a * madam yes where and when have i seen you since that time everywhere and at all * and asleep day and night mohun * true he said with a bitter smile you remember then i am not wrong exclaimed the prisoner * * at him mohun raised his head and i could see the old * expression upon his lips certainly i remember madam he said do you think it possible for any one to forget your charming * and could any thing be more delightful than this interview between two old friends but let us reserve these sweet * these * * one thing only is * to perfect the happiness of this moment the presence this evening of your dear * he is doubtless * elsewhere * expression was singular as he uttered these words the prisoner looked at him as he was speaking with an * smile i can only * it to that of the * about to * a * * my brother she said in * as soft as a * * elsewhere do you say sir you are mistaken in * so he commanded the cavalry with which you were fighting tonight at these words uttered in a strange * voice i saw mohun start as if a * had * his * with all his * he could not * this * of emotion impossible you are * me the prisoner interrupted him with a gay laugh so you do not believe me she said you think my dear sir that everybody is dead but yourself * that idea from your mind i am not dead since we have the pleasure of again meeting in the flesh he is not dead no it was colonel * darke whom you fought tonight this is his horse which i * to take a short ride i have been captured but he is neither dead nor captured and you will doubtless receive some friendly message from him soon under the * * and the * glance it was easy to read profound * the * could not * that at that moment she * a * about to spring mohun had listened with * attention as his companion spoke but as on the first occasion he speedily * his * his face was now as cold and * as though * of * so be it madam he said i will * as i best can to such message as he may send me for yourself you know me well and i am glad to see * no * the past is dead let it sleep you think this interview is painful to me you * yourself madam i would not exchange it for all the wealth of two * and calling an officer he said you will conduct this lady to general stuart * the circumstances * her capture mohun made a * bow to the prisoner as he spoke * me in the same manner and * his horse rode back at the head of his column the prisoner * by the young officer and still riding her fine horse had already disappeared in the darkness an hour afterward i had delivered my message to * and was returning by the road over * hill thinking of the singular * between mohun and the gray woman what had these * meant by their * * how had mohun found himself face to face on this * night with two human * whom he thought dead these questions * me for half an hour then i gave up the * laughing an hour afterward i had passed through culpeper courthouse crossed the fields and had reached general stuarts headquarters stuarts tent or rather the * of * which he called one was * beneath a great oak on a * * about a mile south of the little village above it * the * of fresh june * around were * the white * * of the staff in a * close by * the * * of the * horses * to the trees * their corn in the shadow in the calm summer night the * * and clung to its staff before the tent of stuart a man on guard with drawn * * to and fro with * steps a glance told me that * singular prisoner had arrived a * was holding her fine animal near the generals tent and as i dismounted three figures appeared in the * * these were the figures of stuart the gray woman and a young * farewell madam said stuart * and laughing i am sorry to have made your acquaintance under circumstances so * to you but i trust you will appreciate the situation and not * me * you not in the least general you are a very gallant man and the gay words were accompanied by a * laugh you will have an opportunity of seeing the confederate capital said stuart smiling the lady made a * * and of * me upon the way * and afterward on the route to port * and washington as you will not be * i am sure i shall not * you sir you are the * gentleman i have ever known and with * * they * young * * the lady to her horse and * her to mount they then set forward toward the courthouse stuart had ordered the prisoner to be conducted * and * at the village tavern under guard until morning when she would be sent to richmond as they disappeared i entered the generals tent and found him laughing leaning one hand upon his desk covered with papers upon which rested his * hat he * played with the * of his yellow * with the other hand his blue eyes * and his * * with * that is really a beauty surry he said and i have laughed * he threw himself on his red * as he spoke and began playing with his two * * whose names were * and * he had brought them out of the lines on his saddle well you are really a * i said you * the evil spirit and make prisoners laugh stuart laughed in reply that is a curious person that mohun sent me he said at first she was * enough but i paid her a few * and now she is in an excellent * as you saw yes but what about the fight i made my report of the events of the evening well mohun is a * said stuart a new man but seems made of the right * * what does * say of the attack only a * right and this lady is our * she is handsome is she not but a more curious face i have never seen white cheeks and red * sort of devil and angel * who is she i wonder and what was her * something is under it she gave her name as mrs * her horse made me break the * * surry lady and * are splendid she is certainly a beauty and what eyes dangerous stuart remained silent for some moments and then i heard him sigh do you know my dear surry he said that if people heard us talk in this way they would call us * thing there are two things that people will not * about * i am * and a * do you know what a good man was heard to say of me the other day stuart would be one of the greatest soldiers in the army if he did not drink so hard and others add if he were not a * well need i defend myself to you from these charges i promised my mother in my childhood never to touch * spirits and a drop has never passed my lips except the wine of the * i know i need not tell you that i am equally * of the other * that person does not live who can say that i ever did any thing * of that description and yet i am a * * who never touched drink and love but one person in this world stuarts head sank and he uttered a weary sigh they will not let me alone he * and yet i am here fighting for my country but i * them to take my good name away from me surry and he rose to his feet general lee knows me jackson knew me i have the regard of the one and i had the love of the other what do i care if my children only will not hear these * charges one can never hear them * beloved little * she died while i was fighting near * in the fall of #* nearly broke me down and stuart paused and covered his eyes with his hand between the fingers i saw a * for a moment his breast * like a * issued from the brave lip * the heavy * trembled i think of her * shall never get over her death surry he * they think me hard and cold and bad * is nothing since she died i care less for * opinion and only try to do my duty till the ball comes that will end me and * a * from his eyes stuart walked to the door of his tent from which he gazed forth upon the stars five minutes passed thus and i did not speak then all at once i heard stuart call out * yes sir came from the man on post near the tent tell * to come and bring his * and walking fifty steps stuart * the * neck of his * lady * who was * to a * and looked around affectionately at her master when he returned he was * the * lay on the * and following him was * same old * * * almost sad * his cap * with simple grace and * his * in a moment the tent the * * the whole vicinity was * with the * notes of the * * and * was * as only that great master could * the mighty * of the * of stuart if you want to have a good time * the cavalry * boys * the staff and * quickly assembled the servants were * in the * the horses beneath the * turned their * * leading in the * * might have been heard the * and laughing voice of stuart the * were kept up until nearly midnight then stuart * said with a laugh good morning gentlemen as was his habit when he wished to work and the tent was soon deserted i retired to rest but at three in the morning felt a hand upon my shoulder the general is going to move colonel and wishes to see you said the * i rose made my brief * and went toward stuarts tent where a light was shining he was writing * at his desk as fresh and gay as on the * evening his * constitution * * all at once i saw that there was another * in the tent he was a young man of about twenty of slight figure * face and an expression so * and * that he seemed ready to * if you spoke to him he wore nevertheless the uniform of a captain of artillery and i remember * how this * and * * with the large sad eyes had come to hold a commission captain davenant of my horse artillery colonel surry said stuart the youth colored and then with an air of painful * took a step forward and pressed my hand the grasp of the slender fingers was like the * of a * * davenant has been on a * across the rappahannock to keep his hand in said stuart * writing my horse artillery boys do a little of every * davenant is a * surry with a touch of the bull dog in spite of his looks the young officer drew back * more than ever at these words his confusion seemed to * him of the power of * ill * * * now said stuart laughing and * to write with his back turned as he spoke he is * or * the poor yankees he has killed doubtless you are laughing at me general said the young man * well my laughter wont hurt you davenant i never * with people i dont like but to business the enemy are going to attack me surry get ready i am going to move ready general all * general the voice came like an * then at the door appeared the * * lieutenant * chief of the generals escort have you forgotten him my dear * huge figure his mighty * the deep thunder of his tones i showed you the brave soldier in 1861 and # in 1863 his * was * his voice more like * the * walked along he seemed to shake the ground i am going to move in half an hour * said stuart still writing * headquarters will be established on * hill beyond * my horse * * and * without * a word in five minutes the camp was * and lady * was led up come on surry come on davenant i will beat you to the courthouse and stuart * on his sword drew on his * and mounted his horse i was beside him not to be ready when stuart * to be left behind he waited for nobody his staff soon learned that as * horse was awaiting him he was as prompt as stuart desired in a minute we were all three riding at full speed toward the village stuart was playing with his * which he had taken off and * to and fro his * were * and he was * we did not * him and in ten minutes we were all * over the main street of the * stuart pushed on by the tavern without * in the direction of * when just as he reached the eastern * of the town a small * wagon leaving the place attracted his attention there was just sufficient light to make out the figures in the wagon there were two one was a * and plainly * old * with a prominent nose a double * and * hands * with * * beside him sat an old woman as * as himself wearing a * * * a * * and a huge * cap beneath stuart looked * at the wagon called to the * to * and demanded * he was going and on what business the old * smiled the question seemed to strike him as * and his explanation was simple and * to remove all * he stated that his name was * he lived near the village had brought in a * of * to * on the * * friends had * him and his old woman to spend the night and they were now going home stuart * under the * * and this is your old woman my friend he said with a laugh * so sir was the * reply of the * old * smiling * you see she would come along sir * is mighty contrary a profound sentiment laughed stuart and riding on without further words he left the * free to proceed on his way we crossed a little stream rode on toward * and had nearly reached * when stuart suddenly * in his horse do you know what i think he said that i have done a * thing what general to let that old fellow go on i dont like his looks the old * yes i wish i had arrested * and his wife arrested them stuart * i have an * about * surry and something tells me that i have been * of an * was not his explanation * no what could be wrong everything and his old woman i said laughing think of that * * * i like her least of all from * if you choose i think your * * you this time general i think not well we will see and we did see in two hours the headquarters * were * upon * hill beyond * and stuart sent his * * to culpeper courthouse with orders to conduct the prisoner taken by mohun on the * night to general lee for examination an hour afterward the worthy * returned in hot haste with the * information that the fair lady was * to be found she had disappeared from her chamber none knew how before daylight and as a * * individual who had * been hanging round the tavern had disappeared too it was probable that they had gone off together upon this point a note left by the lady directed to general stuart would probably give information this had been found upon her table and the * wound up by * the note to stuart he read it with an air of decided * then throwing it upon his desk burst into a laugh well surry he said who is right and who is wrong now read that and he pointed to the note which i opened and read it was in a delicate female hand and ran as follows general stuart will pardon the attempt his * is about to make to effect her escape he made himself quite charming in their brief interview but liberty is sweet finding a friend * in this quarter of the world i have made every * with him he is a great master of * and though the * * which i shall * will make me look * i hope it will enable me before sunrise to pass a private ford known to my friend alone and reach the opposite bank of the rappahannock farewell my dear general if all the rebels were like yourself i might change my * i have but one other friend in your * mohun of the cavalry present my * to him and say that we will meet again that was all i raised my eyes from the paper and looked at the general with * then that old woman was the lady * and we are * completely they are by this time on the other side of the rappahannock with these words stuart * the whole subject turned to his desk and in a moment was busy at his official writing on the same evening i was riding with stuart toward culpeper courthouse do you know where we are going surry he said with a laugh i can * i think try to the ball given by the young officers to the * * tonight you are wrong old fellow i dont dare to go there dont dare well that is the word he replied i am not afraid of the yankees but i am of * all of the * * of the newspapers i begin to understand now they are dangerous yes stuart * on playing with his * as usual think of * the * * he laughed they already say i * the cavalry with a * of flowers around my horses neck is it possible they say so everywhere and i will tell you the * for the charge in passing through the courthouse on the morning of the review a young lady friend of mine ran out from her house and threw a * over the neck of my horse well i think it is something to be * in this world i did not throw it off i * her rode on and only removed it when i got out of sight meeting general lee i told him of it laughing and he said with a smile why did you not wear it i might as well have done so surry for you see i have the credit of it why try to be * and pure and * i am a * a * and a * but i care nothing i intend to do my duty old fellow and the next few days will probably show if i can fight with which words stuart broke into a song * on more rapidly and passing without drawing * through the courthouse soon reached general lees headquarters on an * beyond here he remained for an hour in private interview with the commanderinchief finally they came out together general lee in his plain uniform with that * dignity of bearing which made the gray old * so * i had the honor to receive his * and to press his hand and then i set out with general stuart for * in passing through the courthouse we observed the windows of a large building all * with * and heard the merry notes of music stuart drew * i think i will drop in for a few minutes in spite of every thing he said see the end of all my excellent resolutions surry and rapidly * stuart entered the * i followed if the review was * the ball was charming * and * had assembled promptly at the sound of music and if i were a poet or a * my dear reader i would * a fine description of the merry spectacle but alas i am neither and feel * to the * style of writing i am only a * old * with a number of great events to speak of look in the newspapers of that period for an account of the * let me say however in passing that there was something sad as well as * gloomy as well as brilliant in all that * laughter and the movements of these gay figures on the * of the bloody battle of * girls were smiling upon * who in twelve hours would be dead lips were * gallant * they were going to utter the * all went merry as a * and they * to the * music soon the cannon would begin to roll and the * would charge to that * music as they * to this i was * at the * * the * * moving to and fro the gay * the * * the * arms the * cheeks when my attention was attracted by a figure which made me lose sight of all else it was that of a young girl about twenty tall stately and beautiful her dark hair was carried back in * waves and ended in * * her cheeks * * roses the eyes were large brilliant and full of laughing * the lips red and * into a * smile which was the * of * * i grow * but this young girl was * there was something queen like and * in her movements and whole appearance she seemed to look down on the crowd with * * and the gay * who surrounded her were every instant struck by the bright * of a * which spared nothing who was this dangerous beauty who received the * of the young officers with so much * * i asked that question of a friend and he replied miss georgia conway a daughter of judge william conway ah i said the * * of randolph in bitter * yes and yonder he is i looked in the direction indicated and saw an * gentleman of small * with long gray hair and lips full of * smiles he wore a suit of black and there was something * and * in every movement of the slender figure his low bow and sweet smile were the * of * courtesy i was still looking at this gentleman whose fame had extended throughout virginia and the whole south when a familiar voice near me attracted my attention it was that of captain davenant the young officer of the horse artillery and * in the direction of the voice i saw him * over a young lady who was seated and * with him she was a girl of * with blue eyes * hair and a * as fair as a * as davenant addressed her in low tones she gazed up into his face with an expression of * affection in the eyes of the young officer i could read a profound and * love turning to my friend i * the name of the young lady in turn miss virginia conway he replied the only sister of miss georgia he had scarcely uttered the words when * interview with the young lady * in a very singular manner suddenly judge conway passed through the crowd reached the spot where the young people were * and * a glance of * fury at the * glance which made his eyes * * of * his arm to his daughter and * bore her away * face flushed crimson and his eyes * flame he took a step as though about to * all at once he stopped then from red his face became pale the old expression of * returned to his lips with head bent down and a faint color * over his cheeks he went toward the door and passed though it and disappeared before i had time to * upon this singular incident i heard the voice of stuart come surry to horse unless you wish to remain he said ready general i replied and in five minutes we were * toward * a gay ball said stuart as we rode along but do you remember my * surry perfectly general has it told you something on the present occasion yes what you have heard of the famous ball at * broken up by the guns of * certainly well i think that this one will prove * cannon are going to thunder before the music * stuart had scarcely spoken when rapid * were heard in front and a * shot by have you seen general stuart said a voice in the darkness here i * news * the * drew * so suddenly that his horse was thrown upon his * you will be attacked at daylight general * force the whole yankee cavalry with infantry and artillery * all right ride back with me and tell me every thing * in half an hour we were at headquarters stuart dismounted and entered his tent you see i was right surry he said turning toward me and there is something in my * after all at daylight a long thunder came up from the woods of the rappahannock the greatest cavalry combat of the war had begun at that sound stuart leaped to the saddle and rode rapidly toward the front fifteen minutes afterward his headquarters had * on the green slope of * not a tent was visible is the reader familiar with the country along the upper rappahannock if so he will remember that the river is crossed in culpeper by numerous fords the * on the left that is to say up the * * * the railroad bridge and * fords stuarts left under william * lee was opposite * his centre under jones opposite * his right under hampton toward * and a force under * was posted in the direction of * to guard the right flank the whole * to about seven or eight thousand cavalry the federal column which now advanced to attack it is said to have * all the cavalry of general hookers army and must have * more than twelve thousand * stuart rode on rapidly down * hill and was soon opposite * ford where the enemy had crossed in force general jones was heavily engaged and the * of the horse artillery were * steadily every moment the round shot * or the shell * through the woods about three hundred yards in front of the pieces where the dismounted cavalry of the enemy had effected a * they kept up a hot fire at the * and the steady * of * further up the river told that lee was also engaged in face of the * shell the blue * could not advance and stuart sent an order to hampton to move in and attack on the right the * of the * states advanced at the word their dense column was seen slowly moving with drawn * across the plain the moment of decisive struggle seemed rapidly approaching when suddenly a heavy blow was struck at stuarts rear i had been directed by him to * if every thing had been sent off from * and to see that no papers had been dropped there in the * of departure going back at a gallop i soon reached the hill and rode over the ground recently occupied by the headquarters the spot seemed swept not a paper was visible all that i could see was a * * dropped by some young officer of the * * no doubt of the last nights ball at the village i had already turned to ride back to stuart when my attention was attracted by a column of cavalry advancing straight on * is upon stuarts rear what force was that could it be the enemy it was coming from the direction of * but how could it have passed our force there look i said to an officer of the horse artillery one battery of which was left in reserve on the hill look what column is that it must be * was his reply i am sure they are yankees impossible he exclaimed but our * were soon * from the rapidly advancing column two guns shot out and * then two white * of smoke * from their * and the enemys shell burst directly in our faces the horse artillery returned the fire and i hastened back with the intelligence to stuart it is only a * i suppose he replied with great * go back and get all the cavalry you can and charge the guns and * them it is impossible to imagine any thing * than the * voice i knew however that the attack was more critical than he supposed hastened back came up with two regiments and they * the hill at full gallop * the * and * toward the crest suddenly it * with * * the federal cavalry had rushed straight across the fields toward the * its western slope as we * the eastern and met * on in * front they struck the confederates advancing in column of * and in confusion from the rough * * thrown into * and with loud cheers the enemy * all over * hill the battle seemed lost stuart was cut off and * in between two powerful bodies of federal cavalry supported by infantry and artillery all that saved us at that moment was the do or die fighting of the cavalry and horse artillery on the crest of * took place a bitter and obstinate struggle it was one of those * of the * which once witnessed is never forgotten the * of the horse artillery fought as * hand to hand as the regular cavalry and the crest became the scene of a mad * rather of wild * than men all at once the form of davenant appeared amid the smoke he had come rapidly from the front and now threw himself into the combat like the * to which stuart had * him his sad smile had disappeared his cheeks were flushed his eyes * from his horse he seized the * of a gun from which all the * had been driven and * home a charge of * directed the gun upon a column of the enemy before he could fire a federal * rode at him and cut * at his bare head with the full weight of his * davenant did not try to draw his * attempt would have been useless in his hand he had a * and with a * of the * he swept the * from the saddle he fell * covered with blood and davenant * and fired the charge of * upon his * drawing his sword * into the * his head bare his eyes * his voice rising loud and * above the combat it was a * a * struggle three times the enemys guns were charged and captured three times the confederates were * charged in turn and the pieces * by the enemy a final charge of the gray cavalry carried all before it the federal artillery was seized upon and their cavalry driven * at that moment a * force still was seen advancing upon stuart from the direction of * ford it was a splendid spectacle they came on in * column and rapidly formed line of battle on the slope of * with drawn * and * * as they moved they seemed to shake the very ground i had never before seen so great a force of cavalry drawn * the critical moment of the battle had plainly come at that instant the great field presented a remarkable appearance cavalry were * in every direction and it was hard to tell friend from foe stuart was fighting so to say from the centre * the enemy were in his front in his rear and on both his * if they closed in apparently he would be crushed as in a * the iron hand would * him that moment * the * stuarts heart of oak bore the * he was aroused * his cheeks burned his eyes * the man was sufficient for the work i looked closely at him do or die was plain on his face from that instant i never had any * about stuart he rushed two pieces of artillery to a * in front of the line of federal * a moment afterward two reports were heard and two shell burst * in the middle of the line making a wide gap in it and * the charge which had begun all at once i saw a column of cavalry coming up from the river and turning to stuart said general what cavalry is that * stuart exclaimed bring it up like * i set out at full gallop and soon reached the column at the head of it rode young the * * of georgia erect gallant with his brave eye and smile i pointed out the enemy and gave the order all right exclaimed young and turning to his men he * his * around his head and * forward the column * on and as it passed i recognized mohun his * eye and * * * from the * in five minutes they were in front of the * men * and * the federal line charge rose from a hundred lips * were buried in the hot * the mass was * at the enemy and * like thunder sword against sword swept every thing before it not a single shot was * * only was used the enemy were broken to * i saw was a wild * of * * flying horses men * to the * while others were seen throwing themselves from the saddle and raising their hands to escape the keen * * at them the great force of the enemy * down on stuarts flank was thus * the spectacle which followed was * as well as * the enemy fled in * never before had i seen the * in the * shoes of * of * of horses * * like * as they ran the force disappeared in the woods * pursued by their * the dust followed them in a great * that cloud arose * and * * * * that sound * more and more rapidly toward the river on our left the brave william * lee had been as successful he had charged and repulsed the enemy falling wounded at the head of his men they had not again advanced upon him near the * house he presented an * front to them stuart held with his cavalry indeed the whole * range the long thunder of his artillery said to the enemy come on they did not come they went back their cavalry had crossed the river to * the meaning of the great review they had discovered nothing after heavy loss the ground was * with their dead and * retired * and * stuarts loss was also * his staff was not spared one of my brother staff officers was killed another wounded a third captured but stuart had won the greatest cavalry fight of the war in a room of the * house on * hill stuart was writing a * to general lee it was nearly sunset and the red light was * through the windows on the floor lay a number of wounded men * * * * to their wants were two young * daughters of judge conway whom i had seen on the night of the ball the young ladies i afterward discovered had been on a visit to the family * the * house had * remained during the whole of the * they were now * * to the wants of the wounded i was * at the * * beauty with the * eyes who had held that * with her circle of * stuart finished his * and turned around any reports he said * to a member of his staff none * that colonel mohun is reported killed mohun it is impossible he drove the enemy and was * i would not * him for a hundred nor a thousand of the enemy thank you general said a * voice behind us and mohun entered making the military * as he did so in his bearing i could * the same cool pride mingled with * there was only one change in him he was * than ever and i could see that his right shoulder was bloody as he entered miss georgia conway who was * over a wounded soldier raised her head and looked at him * eye met her own and he bowed * taking no further notice of her at this * of * * i could see miss * face * an expression of * * came to the beautiful lips and the * glance indicated that her * * was deeply wounded she turned her back upon him * as mohun had already turned his the movement failed in its object the officer was looking at stuart who had * his hand he * as the general pressed it and turned * but said nothing then you are not dead mohun exclaimed stuart laughing not in the least general i am happy to * you replied mohun i am truly glad to hear it what news our party is all over we followed them up until they * the * i * them this little piece of * for i recognized an old acquaintance in the commander of the * an acquaintance a certain colonel * charming person general and mohun laughed i recognized him yonder when we charged on the hill and at first he followed his men when they broke as i got close to him however in the woods he recognized me in turn and we crossed * he is * man * and he did his * to put an end to me i had somewhat similar views myself in reference to my friend the colonel but his men * and prevented my carrying them out they were all around me * away i was nearly cut out of the * was carried away from my friend in the * the * cut of all was his parting * as he retreated through the river what was that mohun a * from his pistol which * my shoulder a mere * but * i saw him * as he fired an old friend on the yankee side well that * said stuart frequently general said mohun and this one was very dear * tenderly attached to me i assure you my affection for him is of the same * nature and we only crossed * in * mere * * for * we would not hurt each other for * and * * * with laughter there was something restless and * in it suddenly his face grew * and his eyes were half closed well mohun said stuart who was not looking at him i am going to send you across the river on a * tonight all right general and the officer made the military * as he did so he * and stuart raised his eyes you are wounded he exclaimed a * laughed mohun but as he spoke his frame * his face assumed the * of a * and he would have fallen had not miss georgia conway started up * from the wounded man whom she was * to and supported the officer in her arms mohun opened his eyes and a grim smile came to his pale face a pretty * i heard him * it would do to put in a * a cup of * a * would finish as he uttered these singular words the blood * from his wounded shoulder his eyes closed and his head falling on the bosom of the young girl he * * was the first gun of the great campaign which * on the heights of gettysburg a week afterward lees columns were in motion toward pennsylvania was that invasion the * of his own judgment history will answer what is certain is that the country like the army * forward the people were * with wild enthusiasm the soldiers flushed with the pride of their great * of fredericksburg and chancellorsville the authorities at richmond shared the excitement and the * with * * or in * earnest * it is said upon a * for supplies if general lee wishes rations let him seek them in pennsylvania i doubt if the great commander shared the general * i think he * to draw hooker out of virginia leaving the rest to * so he moved toward the potomac the world had called lee * after this invasion that charge was not repeated from first to last * seemed the sentiment * him with hooker on the rappahannock threatening richmond lee thrust his advance force under ewell through the blue ridge toward maryland pushed longstreet up to culpeper to support him and kept only * hill at fredericksburg to bar the road to the confederate capital hooker wished to advance upon it but president lincoln * him the * was a * official * in case you find lee coming to the north of the rappahannock lincoln wrote i would by no means cross to the south of it i would not take any risk of being * upon the river like an * * half over a * and * to be torn by * front and rear without a fair chance to * one way or * the other * perhaps but to the point the * was not always * but often * chancellorsville had been * assault * thus by lincoln would be death hooker fell back therefore in the direction of washington lee had * that fact and had given himself small anxiety his three corps were already in full motion toward the potomac and suddenly the thunder of artillery

to move advanced north of the rappahannock drawing a * of cavalry across the roads above * to guard the * to the mountain the result was that the infantry * through the blue ridge without hookers knowledge he knew that something was going on but there his information * the * of stuart kept watch over fifteen miles of front and through this wall of * the federal eye could not * stuart is regarded by many as only a brave * it was on occasions like this however that he performed his greatest services everywhere he * the enemy in * battle and the work was hard it was fighting fighting * as in 1862 when he covered lees retreat after sharpsburg day and night the cavalry had no rest the * of * the * of * and the roar of cannon were * it was a war of * which * and * saw in those * not until the rear of lees column had nearly reached the potomac did general hooker by a desperate effort * in driving stuart back in these pages i must leave that obstinate struggle * it was full of * scenes and * by daring courage but all is lost to view in the * smoke of gettysburg with one scene in the * * i shall pass to greater events but first i beg to * to the reader a very singular * who is destined to play an important part in the history i am writing it was the night of the #* of june 1863 stuarts headquarters had been established in a house on the * above * we had been fighting all day had returned only at * and i was * a few words with stuart before following the staff to rest when all at once a third * who seemed to have * from the floor stood before us his presence was so sudden and unexpected that i started then i looked at him * he was a man of about forty thin * and with a nose * the * of a bird of * his eyes half buried under * * * like two stars his mouth was large and smiling his expression exceedingly * from the face i passed to the * the worthy was * in severe black with a * white * wore a black * hat of the * order and presented the appearance of a * and * * that of a * smiling * upon all around him stuart uttered an * of satisfaction ah nighthawk here you are he said and turning to me he introduced the new * as mr nighthawk one of my private friends and true as * mr nighthawk bowed with an air of smiling * * * i am glad to know you colonel and hope i may have an opportunity of being of service to you some day he said the voice was low soft and * with the * expression of the countenance well what news nighthawk asked stuart experience tells me that you have something of importance to * ah general yes you pass in the cavalry by the name of the man before the battle for you always turn up then mr nighthawk smiled i try to give you information general and perhaps i have some news but first of my visits to boston new york philadelphia and washington where i saw many of our friends and in his low quiet voice mr nighthawk who had taken a seat and * down his white * proceeded to speak of his * and what he had seen the narrative * me he spoke without reserve for general stuart had informed him that he might do so before me and i was startled to find the number of private friends the south had in the north mr nighthawk was evidently * * at his trade he had a perfect * plainly with persons of the highest political position and stuart listened with the greatest interest to the * whose low voice never rose above the * by which i had been impressed on his first opening his lips so the * up of all this said stuart that our friends are not too * they are not general they say lee must win a great victory on the soil of pennsylvania yes general without it there is no hope of peace they * well i think they are right and that we shall gain the victory mr nighthawk made no reply and stuart * for some moments without speaking then * himself i forgot he said you have not given me your special information nighthawk the worthy smiled you know i am the man before the battle general yes go on nighthawk i have just left general hookers headquarters where are they beyond * you saw him i * with him ah an hour general as the * mr ward from * of the grand union * commission and mr nighthawk smiled of course i urged active movements and general hooker became quite * he agreed with your views then said stuart laughing perfectly general and he * there is the important thing while we were * general hooker was called for a moment out of his tent and by accident my eyes fell upon an order which lay upon his desk an order for two divisions of cavalry one of infantry and a full * of artillery to advance and drive you back to the mountain ah you saw that order i did general it was just ready to be sent what day did it * tomorrow general ah indeed two divisions of infantry and one of cavalry mr nighthawk * in * when did you leave hookers headquarters this afternoon and you came through the lines tonight yes general in the usual way by passing through the * i was on foot and nothing was * stuart * his * and * then he called to the * * the * and have three * ready at once mr nighthawk arose * general he said i saw swartz whom i have mentioned to you yes the best spy you say in the federal army i think he is general he is a wonderful man he recently played a * upon you upon me at least he bore off a prisoner from you it was a lady captured by colonel mohun one night on the rappahannock ah is it possible so swartz was the old * driving the wagon that morning so he informed me general you are friends then close friends and mr nighthawk smiled we have an * that would not interest you general that was really swartz and the old woman was the prisoner well said stuart that was a bold * but the lady was handsome enough to make friends there is something between herself and colonel mohun is there not mr nighthawk glanced quickly at the face of the general his eyes * * points but the * glance at once sank something between them general what could have made you think that but here is major mcclellan i will not * you general i will come back at daylight to receive your orders with these words mr nighthawk * a * smile bowed in a friendly manner and disappeared it was difficult to say how from the apartment i had turned my eyes from him but an instant when i again looked he was gone and now to work exclaimed stuart we are going to fight tomorrow surry since the man before the battle has made his appearance at * stuart was going at full gallop to the front a rapid fire of skirmishers mingled with the * roar of cannon indicated that nighthawk had not been * all at once the sharpshooters were seen falling back from the woods bring me a piece of artillery exclaimed stuart * to the front but the attack of the enemy swept all before it stuart was driven back and was returning * when the gun for which he had sent * up and * in the road it was too late suddenly a * shot * above us the gun was * from its carriage and rolled * and useless in the wood the horses were seen * wild with terror and trying to * out of the * suddenly one of them leaped into the air and fell torn in two by a second round shot quick work said stuart * and turning round to me he said * to a hill in rear post three pieces on that hill to * all the roads the order like the former came too late however the enemy advanced in * * stuart back beyond his headquarters where they captured the military * of the present * still * forward like a * compelled the confederate cavalry to retire behind * creek on the high ground there stuart posted his artillery opened a rapid fire and before this storm of shell the federal forces paused the spectacle at that moment was * and * the enemys force was evidently large long columns of cavalry heavy * of infantry and artillery at every opening right left and centre showed that the task of driving back stuart was not regarded as very easy the sunshine * from * and * all along the great line of * from the heavy smoke * with flame came the federal shell with their infantry cavalry and artillery they seemed determined to put an end to us stuart * to his guns * a steady fire from the lofty hill captain davenant directed it in person and he was evidently in his right * all his * had disappeared a cool and * smile * up his features all right davenant hold your ground exclaimed stuart i will do so general can you keep them from crossing i can try general a * of shell * around the two * for the * time i witnessed that entire * to danger which was a * of stuart the fire at this moment was so terrible that i heard an officer say general stuart seems trying to get himself and everybody killed nothing more * however can be * than his appearance at that moment his horse wild with terror * * and attempted to * his * stuart paid no attention to him he had no eyes or thought for any thing but the enemy his cheeks were flushed his eyes * * a * king of battle from stuart my * passed to davenant his * impressed me deeply while giving an order a shell burst right in his face * horse and * in a cloud of * when the smoke * away he was sitting his horse * and giving the order as quietly as before i have not * this picture reader or * this character i had the honor to enjoy the friendship of the brave boy i describe he was remarkable in an * crowded with remarkable characters stuart held his ground for an hour on the high hills of * creek but it then became plain that he was going to be driven back the enemy had felt him and discovered that the game was in their own hands now they rushed on his right left and centre at the same * infantry and artillery * on like a * the stream charged the * a moment a bitter and * combat commenced for the possession of the crest stuart rushed toward the guns as he reached them a cannon ball carried off the head of a * and his horse * with * nearly * on the * trunk which * blood davenant had * drawn his * but had given no order to retire move back the guns exclaimed stuart is it necessary general asked davenant yes they will be captured in five minutes it is a pity we can not remain general this is an excellent position and he gave the order to * up the * was performed amid a * of * striking down the * suddenly a column of federal cavalry charged straight at the guns davenant met them with his mounted men armed with * and a * combat followed it was a * to * affair and davenant was in the midst of it * you are fighting for your guns boys you promised to die by your guns the men answered with fierce * and met the enemy with * resolution meanwhile the guns had rushed at a gallop down the western slope a regiment came to * assistance the fight grew desperate but was of no * in fifteen minutes we were driven driven do you know what that means reader ask old soldiers if it is pleasant they will * in reply we were forced back step by step with the enemy at our very * at our * came on the huge column * and firing mad with triumph stuart the * the obstinate the * was driven we were forced back to * and there things looked * on the other roads stuarts right and left were rapidly * his centre at * seemed devoted to destruction the enemy came on like a * with a * * as far as the eye could see the great fields were dark with them their horse artillery advanced at a gallop * and * the retreating columns with shot and shell i was ten yards from stuart just at the edge of the town when a picked body of federal * * straight upon him they had evidently recognized him by his * uniform and splendid * * * around him * were struck at him and for an instant i saw him in the midst of a wild * of enemies * himself with his * only in an instant he would have been killed or captured with his staff and * when a * * was heard i glanced over my shoulder and saw the * of hampton coming on with drawn * then a splendid spectacle was * of * hampton in one of his great moments this * * was leading his men and in an instant they had struck the enemy with a noise like thunder suddenly a * on a black horse rushed by like the wild * and i recognized mohun who * his animal to * speed drove straight at the leader of the federal cavalry almost in * with us through a * in the smoke i caught a * of * * he was a man of low * but broad heavy and powerful he came to meet his adversary with the * of his horse resting on the * neck while both hands * a heavy * raised over his right shoulder i could only see that the two * * together like * * their * * they closed in body to body then the smoke wrapped them it was impossible to see more * and * at the * which had come to * his victory of * stuart * near paris that night and made every preparation to attack at dawn at daylight he was in the saddle and * to the high ground commanding * all at once he * his horse the enemy had disappeared stuarts blue eye flashed and half an hour afterward he was advancing at the head of his cavalry not a foe was visible pressing on through * and over the * fields beyond he continued to advance upon * and near that place came up with the rear of the enemy they showed little fight however and were driven beyond the place the gray * pursued them with * and * which were mingled * of * from the people of * an hour afterward the lines were * in triumph stuart returned to his former headquarters amid a * rain and this * an incident very honorable to the brave soldier as night * dark and * stuart gazed * at the * of rain falling my poor fellows he said with a sigh they will have a hard time tonight then suddenly turning to his servant he added spread my * and * under that * tree yonder i will keep them dry enough when i once get into them you are not going to sleep out on such a night general exclaimed a staff officer certainly i am was his reply i dont intend to * better than my men and an hour afterward stuart was asleep under the * tree with a * * on him that was the act of a good officer and soldier was it not reader before sunrise stuart was up and walking * to and fro as the day wore on he exhibited more and more * all at once at the appearance of an officer approaching rapidly from the front he uttered an * of pleasure here is * at last he said and he went to meet the * it was the famous chief of * whose name by this time had become a terror to the enemy he wore a plain gray uniform a * of * in a * * rode a * gray * and i recognized at once the * glance and * smile which had struck me on that night when he * * and myself in * stuart rapidly drew him into a private apartment remained in * with him for half an hour and then came forth with a smile of evident satisfaction * intelligence must have pleased him it at least * his gloom an hour afterward his headquarters had * thing was sent toward the mountains stuart set out apparently to follow * that was only a * to blind * a quarter of a mile from headquarters he leaped a * and * back going in the direction now of manassas at daylight on the next morning he had forced his way through the bull run mountain two hours afterward he had made a sudden attack on the enemys infantry it was the rear of * corps which was the rear of hookers army then * toward the potomac stuarts fight near * here * to was a gay affair but i pass over it to a scene still * and * more pleasant the fighting continued throughout the day and at * a heavy rain came on we were all tired and * general no less so than his * when an invitation was sent to us by a gentleman near * to come and * with him we accepted it with * and hastened toward the friendly mansion a delightful reception awaited us the house was full of young ladies * devoted to rebels and we were greeted with an enthusiasm which passed all * delicate hands pressed our own bright eyes * upon us * lips smiled * voices said * soon a * * * the mansion indicated that the wants of the * man were not forgotten an excellent supper was plainly in preparation for the bold stuart and his military family and that gay and gallant * general fitz lee having also been invited the joy of the occasion was complete the house rang with * * * * and * * a more charming sound still however was that made by * * and * * and * and forks all was joy and * * * and laughter young ladies went and came the * grew more * in ten minutes the door of a large apartment opposite the drawingroom was thrown open and a magnificent an * spectacle was revealed to every eye not to be carried away however by enthusiasm i will simply say that we saw before us a long * table covered with the most * * * * bread of every * and real

* i applied for an * to duty in the cavalry then the war office had a time of it i * the * of the red * day and night and they got so tired of me at last that they told me to find a general who wanted

supper thats my history old fellow except that i have just fallen in * the young angel who waited on me at supper miss * dare i opened the campaign in a corner last * i intend to win her surry or * in the attempt as tom * uttered these words a loud * in front startled us stuart had * on ahead of his column through the immense deserted camps around * run * attended only by two or three staff officers as i now raised my head quickly i saw him coming back at * speed * his horse by means of the * only and * pursued by a detachment of federal cavalry firing on him as they pressed with loud * upon his very * * * the enemy and this order was followed by * * * stuart did not obey the order * * and a storm of * * around our heads i had drawn my sword but before i could go to stuarts assistance tom shot ahead of me he came just in time two of the enemy had caught up with stuart and were making furious * at him he * the blow of one of the federal * the other fell from the saddle throwing up his hands as he did so tom * had placed his pistol on his breast and shot him through the heart but by this time the rest had reached us a * flashed above * head fell * him out of the saddle nearly and he would have dropped from it had i not passed my arm around him in another instant all three would have been killed or captured but the firing had given the alarm a thunder of * was heard a * of our cavalry dashed over the hill in three minutes the enemy were flying to escape the edge of the * stuart led the charge and seemed to enjoy it with the * of a * he had indeed escaped from a critical danger he had pushed on with a few of his staff as i have said to fairfax station had then stopped and slipped his * to allow his horse to eat some yankee * and while standing beside the animal had been suddenly charged by the party of federal cavalry coming down on a * from the direction of the courthouse so sudden was their appearance that he was nearly * up he had leaped on the * horse seized the * and fled at full speed the enemy had pursued him he had declined * the reader has seen the * stuart pressed the party * toward * but they * * on the way however a party of officers at a * * the general came back in high good * the * seemed to have delighted him * for old tom * he exclaimed you ought to have seen him when they were * at him and * his fine new * tom * did not seem to * in the generals * he was * the * which a * * had nearly cut in two what are you looking at asked stuart this * general replied tom * a * sigh well it is a * it is a serious matter general you have lost something yes what a * of my new * and tom * expression was so melancholy that stuart burst into laughter you may have lost your * tom he said leaning on his shoulder but you have won your * at least in the cavalry at daylight on the next morning stuart had crossed the potomac into maryland he had advanced from * run * to fairfax court house where the men * the * * of * * white * * * and every * and * the column pushed on toward * * where the long * line of * might have been seen hour after hour crossing the * river each man to prevent * holding above his head a shot or shell taken from the * then the artillery was dragged through the * horses * on and the first * of day saw the long column of stuart ready to advance on its * * to the * by the route between the federal army and washington the word was given and with the red * * stuart moved toward * * save by a * which was driven off by the advance guard without further incident he then pushed on and entered the town in triumph a charming reception awaited him the place was thoroughly southern and the passage of the cavalry was greeted with loud cheers * was the delight above all of a seminary of young girls doors and windows were crowded bright eyes shone red lips laughed waving * were seen everywhere and when stuart appeared in person he was received with wild * he bowed low * his * hat but suddenly intelligence came which forced him to * on a long train of government wagons had come up from washington and on * our presence returned toward the city at a gallop but the * rebels were after them stuart led the * * * * were soon * trains became our * with * * * driven * in * before them the cavalry * the captured wagons continued their way toward pennsylvania moving all that night stuart came to * where fitz lee the gallant drove the enemys cavalry from their camp and the town fell into the hands of stuart here * instead of smiles greeted us every face was * and * with a few * so we hastened to * from that loyal town and were soon on the soil of pennsylvania approaching * we suddenly * up the * * leading stuarts advance pushed ahead and drove in a * then that brave soldier rushed on and seemed * on taking the place when i was sent by stuart to order him not to go too far i came up with * as he was * but had scarcely given him the order when he was charged in turn by a heavy force and driven back the enemy rushed on firing * and the road was full of * * to avoid being carried away with them i * into a field when all at once stuart appeared retreating at full gallop before a party who were * him it was a serious matter then but i laugh now * that good run stuart and myself retreated at a gallop * to * leaped * and * and got off in safety a few moments afterward his artillery opened its * from the lofty hill that * captain of the horse artillery breathed * * driving them back * guns on the right had opened * until night we held the heights * every advance of the enemy it was truly a fine spectacle that handsome town of * as i looked at it on the afternoon of the fair june day in front extended green fields then the church * rose above the * of the town behind a range of mountains formed a * * it is true the * of the scene were far from peaceful the green fields were full of blue sharpshooters in the * were posted batteries down the mountain road behind wound a long compact column of cavalry breathed fought hard that day from the waving field of * on the * his guns * * the face of that fire the enemy could not or would not advance so the night came on and stuarts great train moved those wagons were a terrible * to us on the march but stuart determined not to * them and they were dragged * line stretched to * * dear reader the march was a sort of dream to me how can i * my * numerous * and events of the time i know not even now if they were events or mere dreams seeing that all the long way i was half asleep in the saddle it was a * * that we moved through on horseback the * the * the * the * * the red * the * voices the strange * these * things or the mere * of a * was i an officer of real cavalry making a real march or a * being one of a long column of * i seem * to remember a pretty face whose * smiled on * a faint memory remains of a supper which she gave me if i am not mistaken i was left alone in the town of * faces were around * i was falling asleep when * cavalry came up i think then i rode on with * been left to direct him that we talked about horses and the * of blood in * that at dawn hampton said i am * for sleep and that we lay down side by side near a * all that is a sort of * and others were no better than myself whole columns went to sleep in the saddle as they rode along and general stuart told me afterward that he saw a man attempt to * over a * half * only and go to sleep on the top * some day i promise myself the pleasure of * in pennsylvania it * all the * to me of a world seen in a dream but after that good sleep side by side with the great * things looked far more real and * on i again caught up with stuart he advanced steadily on * and in the afternoon we heard artillery from the south i looked at my military * and * the distance the result was that i said general those guns are at a place called gettysburg on this * impossible was his reply they can not be fighting there you are certainly wrong but i was right those guns were the signal of the first days fight at gettysburg it can not be said that we accomplished very * results at * the enemy * it bravely stuart sent in a flag * a surrender this proposition was * declined and for fear that there might possibly remain some * on the subject the federal commander of the post opened with artillery upon the gray cavalry that was the signal for a * fight and a magnificent spectacle also as soon as the enemys * to the flag of * had been received stuart advanced his sharpshooters replied with his artillery to their own and * a party to destroy the * united states * formerly used as * for * to the army in ten minutes the * were wrapped in flames and the city of * was * * the crimson light of the * revealed every house the long lines of trees and made the delicate church * rising * * * * of * marble i recall but one scene which was equally * * city of fredericksburg on the night of december # 1862 when the church * were * by the burning houses as those of * were in june 1863 so much for this new * of * here my description * it was * mere picture an hour afterward stuart ceased firing the * died down back into the black night sank the fair town of * seen then for the first and the last time by this * the guns were silent the cavalry retired and stuart accompanied by his staff * back to a great deserted house where he established his * headquarters on the bold face there was an expression of decided * he had just received a * by * from general lee that * said come i need you * here and the here in question was gettysburg at least twenty miles distant now with * men and horses twenty miles was a serious matter stuarts * were * and he * * suddenly he turned and addressed me you were right surry he said those guns were at gettysburg this * sent this morning reports the enemy near there i bowed stuart * for some moments without speaking then he suddenly said i wish you would go to general lee and say i am coming surry how is your horse * general but i can get another good tell general lee that i will move at once to gettysburg with all my force and as rapidly as possible i will lose no time general and * i went out from the captured horses i selected the best one i could find and * the * in his sides set out through the black night you know when you set out the * says but you know not when you will * i left * * the night on the road to gettysburg little thinking that a curious incident was to * to me upon the * incident closely connected with the * of some * who play prominent parts in this history i had * on for more than an hour through the darkness keeping a good * for the enemy whose * parties of cavalry were known to be * around when all at once my horse who was going at full speed struck his foot against a sharp point of rock * out from the * the animal * recovered himself and went on as rapidly as before a hundred yards further his speed * then he began to * * then in spite of every application of the * i could not force him out of a slow * * it was truly unfortunate i was the * of an important message and was surrounded by enemies the only chance was to pass through them under shadow of the darkness with light they would * me and my capture be certain a hundred yards further and i found i must decide at once upon the course to * my horse seemed about to fall at every * of the * he * * and his * had become a * i looked around through the trees and at the distance of a quarter of a mile i saw the * of a light to obtain another horse was * under the circumstances and looking to see that my * was * and * i forced my * animal toward the mansion in which the light * my design was simply to proceed * * a fresh horse at the * * throw my saddle upon him leave my own animal and proceed on my way * across the fields and * to let down the * which my * animal could not * i soon approached the light it shone through the window of a house of some * with * grounds around it and apparently the * of a man of means at fifty * from it i dismounted and * my horse in the shadow of some trees a brief * under the circumstances was * and approaching the mansion silently without * my * to make any * i gained the long * in front and went to a window reaching down to the * of the * through the * * i could see into a large apartment half library half * as the easy * * * * and * showed on the * burned a brilliant * by its light i witnessed a spectacle which made me draw back in the shadow of the * and * my eyes on the * before me in the * apartment i saw the woman whom mohun had captured on the rappahannock and beside her the * with whom she had escaped that morning in the wagon from culpeper courthouse i could not mistake him the large prominent nose the * eyes the double * the * person and the * hands covered with * * were still fresh in my memory the name of this * had been revealed by nighthawk swartz the secret agent * and best spy in the federal army was before me a glance at the woman revealed no change in her appearance before me was the same * and graceful figure * as before in a gray dress i saw the same * cheeks red lips and large eyes burning with a * fire the two were * engaged and it was not difficult to understand their * the * * and * of the apartment were all open and the female with rapid hands was * papers from them to swartz who * * them in a * * these papers were no doubt important and the * to remove them to some place of safety beyond the reach of the confederates i gazed for some moments without moving upon the spectacle of these two * at their work the countenance of the lady was * her * rapid and from time to time she stopped to listen swartz on the contrary was the * of * * his face wore an expression of entire * and he seemed to * no * whatever of * all at once however i saw his eyes * as they fell upon a paper which she handed him to * away with the rest it was carefully folded but one of the folds * open as he received it and his eyes were suddenly fixed * upon the * then his head turned quickly and he looked at his companion she was * over a * and did not * that glance * swartz folded up the paper quietly put it in his pocket and went on * the * with his former * only a slight color in his face seemed to indicate concealed emotion as he * the paper his companion turned round it was plain that she had not * the * at the same moment i heard the sound of * in rear of the house and the * of a * as a * dismounted a few * words apparently addressed to a servant or * followed then the door of the apartment opposite the front window was thrown open and a man entered in the * i recognized * adversary at * darke of the united states cavalry darke entered the apartment * but his appearance seemed to occasion no surprise the spy * his * the lady went on with her work you would have said that they had expected the officer and recognized his step their * was brief darke * in * * of the task in which the man and woman were engaged and * his arms in front of the marble * looked on in silence i gazed at him with interest and more carefully than i had been able to do during the fight at * when the smoke soon concealed him let me draw his * of all the human * whom i encountered in the war this ones character and career were perhaps the most remarkable were i writing a * i should be * to call him the real hero of this volume he was a man approaching middle age low in * but broad * and powerful he was * in the * uniform of a colonel of the united states cavalry wore * reaching to the knee and * with large * and his arms were an immense * and a * of * in black * * attached to his * his face was * * by * in drink apparently and half covered by a * * and * as black as night the eyes were * and * the * of the head upon the shoulders * the expression of the entire countenance cold * grim such was this man upon the * but there was something more about him which * attracted attention and aroused * at the first glance you set him down as a * * the * of every * * at the second glance you began to doubt whether he was a mere * * could see at least that this man was not of low * there was in his bearing an * something which indicated that he had seen better days the * of the * was * and * but the * beneath was of velvet not * gray that * i thought was once a gentleman and crime or drink has destroyed him darke continued to gaze at swartz and the gray woman as they * their busy work and once or twice be pointed to * which they had failed to open these * were promptly * and the work went on the few words which the parties uttered came in an * * only through the window at which i was stationed such was the scene within the mansion upon which i gazed with strong curiosity suddenly the * of a horse was heard in a * of woods beyond the front gate and darke quickly raised his head and then came out to the * he passed within three feet of me but did not * me as i was concealed by one of the open * then he paused and listened the wind sighed in the * and a distant * was * was all no other noise * the silence of the july night darke remained upon the * for some moments listening * then turned and * the house through the window i could see him make his appearance again in the * apartment in * to the * of * from his companions he made a * only but that said plainly nothing is * you can go on with your work in this however he was mistaken darke had scarcely * the apartment when i * the * of horses beyond the front * the * were heard * the low * moment afterward two figures came on at full gallop threw themselves from the saddle and rapidly approached the house the * of a * which one of them wore attracted * attention he reached the door of the room at a single * at the same instant the new * rushed by me and burst in as they passed i recognized them one was mohun the other nighthawk what followed was * the * were face to face and each drew his pistol and fired at the same moment neither was struck they drew their * and through the cloud of smoke * the apartment i could see darke and mohun close in in a hand to hand * they were both excellent * and the struggle was passionate and terrible * movements were those of the * * upon his * but darke met the attack with a * and * which indicated * * his expression seemed even to indicate that crossing * with his adversary gave the * * extreme pleasure his face * and a * * from beneath the * * i could see him smile but the smile was strange from the * my glance passed quickly to the gray woman she was leaning against the wall and exhibited no emotion whatever but the * * in the great dark eyes as she looked at mohun clearly indicated that a storm was * in her bosom opposite the woman stood * but * a pistol as to swartz that worthy had * by an open window near and had * through it and disappeared to return to the * the passionate * absorbed all my attention mohun and darke were * at each other * they seemed equally * and the result was * one thing only seemed * in a few minutes one of the * would be dead such was the situation of affairs when * were heard without the * of * followed and the door behind darke was burst open * by his * who rushed in * look out colonel the enemy are on you as he uttered these words the man drew a * and * at * breast before he could fire however an * was heard and i saw the man suddenly drop his * which went off as it escaped from his * grasp then he threw up his hands * took two * steps * and fell at full length on the floor nighthawk had shot him through the heart all this had taken place in far less time than it has taken to write it i had made violent efforts to break through the window and finding this impossible now ran to the door and burst into the apartment the singular scene was to have as singular a * darke evidently realized the great danger which he ran for the house was now surrounded nearly and his capture was * from the black eyes shot a * of * and advancing upon mohun he delivered a blow at him which nearly * his * sword mohun struck in turn * a furious cut at darke but as he did so he * over the dead * and nearly fell for the moment he was at * mercy i rushed forward sword in hand to ward off the * * which i was certain his adversary would * but my * was useless darke * from his * adversary instead of striking at him i could scarcely believe my own eyes but the fact was * then the federal colonel looked around and his eye fell upon the woman kill him she said * do not mind * kill him no * darke and * the woman in his arms they shall not take you prisoner he said and the * * passed through the door in rear at a single bound bearing off the woman like a * a moment afterward the * of a horse were heard darke had disappeared with the gray woman i turned to look at mohun he was standing perfectly * and looking after darke with a strange expression of gloom and astonishment you are * i said he turned quickly and held out his hand slightly * i am not thinking of that of what then i remember only one * this man might have buried his sword in my heart and did not an hour afterward the skirmish was over i had explained my presence at the house to mohun parted with him * to see him soon again and mounted upon a fresh animal which mohun presented to me from among those captured was once more on my way to gettysburg it was hard to realize that the scenes of the night were * * they were more like dreams than * i came in sight of gettysburg at sunrise * * with so many tears with so much mourning with those * which * their way from the human heart as the * makes its way from the * of the * there are words in the * history whose very sound is like a sigh or a * places which are * * by the * lips of mothers * sisters and * * figures * and * in mourning seem to * above these * * arms with * fingers point to the soil beneath crowded with * from the eyes dim and * * * things and the * of the * lips is the * * of the * torn from its * and erect as though the last * had * and the dead had * no fresh flowers * in these dreary * no merry birds * there no * * * with * * beneath the * or the * * of trees see the * and * * are like the deadly * flowers of war * or trying to * on * hear the voices of the few * are sad and * see the * are * * and torn by * listen the stream yonder is not * and * like other * you would say that it is * as it * away * and ashamed the * it has * * its horror and make it sad the * * has not given back the bright * of children laughing and gathering the summer flowers on its banks as it * like a * through the * fields of battle it * bare the * of the dead in * * * and * to the upper air once more the * * and the * * names of * at whose * the heart * the blood * * * where the traveller * back turning away in horror all the world is * with them everywhere they make the * black among them none is * or * with a more * horror than the once * village of gettysburg i reached it on the morning of july # 1863 the immense * was in full progress the * had * together riding across the * fields north of the town i saw the * of the combat of the * * among the dying i remember still a poor federal soldier who looked at me with his * and * eye as i passed he was an enemy but he was dying and i * him a few words will describe the situation of affairs at that moment lee had pressed on * through the valley of the * when news came that general meade who had succeeded hooker was advancing to * battle to the * at that intelligence lee arrested his march meade * his * and it was necessary to check him hills corps was therefore sent across the south mountain toward gettysburg ewell who had reached york was ordered back and lee made his preparations to fight his adversary as soon as he appeared the columns encountered each other in the neighborhood of * great centre toward which a number of roads * like the * of a * toward the * the head of hills column struck the head of * the thunder began the day and scene were lovely on the waving * and the * in full * the light of a summer sun fell in * * a slight rain had fallen the wind was gently * and the leaves and golden * were covered with * which the sunshine changed to * over the exquisite * * a beautiful * soon blood had * the * and the bright bow * the sky was hidden by * smoke * * from burning * set on fire by shell i give but a few words to this first struggle which i did not witness the federal forces rushed forward * we have come to stay and a very large portion of them said one of their officers general * never left that ground alas many thousands in gray too came to stay hill was hard pressed and sent for assistance suddenly it appeared from the woods on his left where ewells * were seen coming back from the * * the head of ewells corps formed line and threw himself into the action early came up on the left * charged and broke through the federal centre gordon commanding a brigade then closed in on their right flank and the battle was decided the great blue * was * and gave way the confederates pressed on and the federal army became a * they retreated * through gettysburg toward cemetery hill leaving their * and five thousand prisoners in our hands such was the first days fight at gettysburg lees head of column had struck meades each had rapidly been reinforced the affair became a battle and the federal forces were completely defeated that was the turning point of the campaign if this success had only been followed * we could only have seized upon and occupied cemetery hill then general meade would have been compelled to retire upon * and washington he would doubtless have fought somewhere but it is a terrible thing to have an army flushed with victory after you cemetery range was not seized that night when the sun rose the next morning the golden moment had passed general meade was ready from right to left as far as the eye could reach the heights * with blue infantry and artillery from every point on the ridge waved the enemys battle * from the * of his * * meade sent his * * to his adversary to attack him come on the federal artillery seemed to * * and lees guns from the ridge opposite * * in reply we are coming alas that is the word which * to the lips of every * above all to every * who * to describe this terrible battle of gettysburg the cheeks * the voice * and something like a fiery * * the eyes what comes back to the memory of the old soldiers who saw that fight is a great picture of heroic * * in * * * charges such as the world has rarely seen made in * furious * the only result of which was to * those fatal fields with the dead bodies of the flower of the southern race and we were so near * twice the enemy * and one more * one more promised the south a complete victory when longstreet attacked round top hill driving the enemy back to their * line victory seemed within our very * we could not * it the enemy * that and it is one of their own * who * that the century * when longstreet paused on the slope of the hill pickett * cemetery heights and wanted only support five thousand men at his back would have given him victory there is a name for the battle of gettysburg which exactly * * great * you must go to the * reader for a * account of this battle i have not the heart to write it and * to give you a few scenes only in my * * i can touch only upon the * points and make the general picture the ground on which the battle was fought is familiar to many thousands a few words will describe it cemetery ridge where general meade had taken up his position is a range of hills running * toward gettysburg within a mile of which place it * off to the right * in a lofty and * crest this crest was meades right his line stretched away * then and ended at round top hill the southern * of the range about four miles distant from one end to the other of the * range * * and the * of cannon * * opposite the cemetery range was a lower line of hills called seminary range upon this lee was posted ewell holding his left a p hill his centre and longstreet his right between the two armies stretched a valley waving with * and * with * through which ran the * road on the western side of a small stream the golden * waved gently the * water * away beneath grass and flowers the birds were singing the sun was * was the * of all scenes for a bloody conflict i rode along the line of battle and * * the features of the * there is a * interest connected with ground which is soon going to become the * of a great combat a glance told me that the enemys position was much the stronger of the two would lee attack it from the * i turned to look at the army never had i seen them so * it would be impossible to * any idea of the * which * them up every mans * seemed to run with * instead of blood every cheek was * every eye flashed with * joy and * you would have supposed indeed that the troops were under the effect of * or laughing * i never even * such courage said a federal officer afterward your men seemed to be * with victory when they charged us that was * an * already on the morning of battle they presented this appearance lying down in line of battle they laughed * sang and * children * a * on the faces of * veterans and * alike was a splendid pride the * of fredericksburg and chancellorsville had * the troops they thought little of a foe who could be so easily driven they looked forward to victory as a * * they did not remember that they held the heights at fredericksburg and that meade on cemetery hill was an adversary very different from hooker in the * wilderness such was the spectacle which i witnessed when after * my message to general lee i rode along the southern line i think the great commander shared in some measure the sentiment of his troops his bearing was collected in his eye you could read no * of excitement the lips covered by the gray * were firm and composed and he greeted me with quiet * in the cheeks of the great soldier a * glow seemed to * anticipated victory i confess i shared the general sentiment that strange * was * and i was * like the rest with the thought of triumph that triumph would open to us the * of washington and bring peace the north scarcely denied that * they may deny it today the whole country was completely weary of the war there seemed to be no hope of * the south to return to the union a victory over meade opening the whole north to lee promised a * of peace the day had arrived apparently when the army of northern virginia * in hand was about to * the terms of that * lee has only to * the * i thought as i gazed at the army and these * will * down their * alas they * it but were torn too they did all at gettysburg that any troops could do what was impossible was beyond even their strength from the morning of the second of july to the evening of the third the fields south of gettysburg were one great scene of smoke dust * blood of columns advancing and returning cannon * men * * cheering and dying blue mingled with gray in * and * battle in that * with the ears * you saw or heard little distinctly but above the * struggle rose two great * which on * days decided every thing the first of them was longstreets assault on the enemys left wing in front of round top hill lee had * excellent * in * upon this movement and it will be seen that it came within an * of success standing upon seminary range near his centre he had * general meades position through his * with great attention and this examination revealed the fact that the federal line was * forward in a * in front of round top hill a * and almost * * near which rested general meades extreme left if this weak point could be carried it appeared said lee that its possession would give * for * and carrying the more * ground and crest beyond as to the importance of that * round top * general meade if they had succeeded in * that it would have prevented me from holding any of the ground which i subsequently held to the last lee determined to attack the * making at the same time a heavy * a real * the federal right opposite ewell all his preparations were not made until the afternoon then suddenly longstreets artillery opened its * at that moment the spectacle was grand the heights the * the fields and the * crest opposite were * in smoke and fire from the * shell the * roar * like the * of a thousand * leaped back from the * and rolled away in wild * through the hills all the * seemed let * and yet this was only the * at four in the evening the thunder dropped to silence and along the lines of hood and mclaws which formed the * column ran a wild cheer which must have reached the ears of the enemy opposite that cheer told both sides that the moment had come the word was given and longstreet * his column at the blue line * a * in his front the blow was * straight at the * in the federal line and in spite of a brave resistance it was swept away mclaws advancing rapidly toward the high ground in its rear at one blow the whole left wing of general meades army seemed thrown into * confusion and hood pressing forward on * right hastened to seize upon the famous round top from which he would be able to * his thunder upon the flank and rear of the federal line of battle the scene like the conflict which now took place was wild and singular the crest of round top hill was a mass of rock which rose * from the rough and * slope it was * the sudden * of the force in front of it had not been * one * rush on the part of hood alone seemed necessary to give him possession of the real key of the whole position hood saw that at a glance and dashed up the slope at the head of his men it was scarcely an order of battle which his troops presented at this moment but one thought burned in every heart the men * up the * the woods gave back the * thunder of their cheers already the southern * carried by the * were * on the crest the mass rushed toward the red * for an instant the gray figures were seen erect upon the * a sudden * of * * a mad struggle began with a federal brigade which had hastened to the spot this force it is said was hurried up by general warren who finding the federal * about to retire ordered them to remain and continue waving their * to the last and then * on the first brigade he could find rushed them up the slope to the crest they arrived just in time hoods men were * on the crest a loud cheer arose but all at once they found themselves face to face with a line of * while beyond were seen * and * * * up cannon what followed was a * * rather than an ordinary conflict only a small part of hoods force had reached the * and this was * by a whole brigade the fight was * all that the eye could make out for some moments in the dust and smoke was a * mass of men * each other * * with the * of * or * with * in blue and gray * * falling and dying in the midst of the * of * and the thunder of cannon which * the crest in flame when the smoke * it was seen that the confederates had been repulsed and driven from the hill hood was falling back slowly like a wounded * who * at the * and * him to the last the slope was * with some of his * the federal cannon * on round top hill seemed to be laughing * mclaws too had fallen back after nearly * upon the crest in his front the enemy had quickly * their left with brigades divisions and corps and the confederates had been * * in their turn as night * the whole southern line fell back the * moonlight shone on the * faces of the * dead longstreet sat on a * * a * with his * when an english officer near him exclaimed i would not have * this for any thing longstreet laughed * i would like to have * it very much he said lees great blow at the enemys left had failed he had thrown his entire right wing under longstreet against it the enemy had been driven victory seemed * suddenly the blue lines had * they had returned to the struggle their huge * had rolled forward thrown longstreet back in turn and now the pale moon looked down on the battlefield where some of the * souls of the south had poured out their blood in vain lee had accomplished nothing and one of his great corps was * and * it was not * or even * the iron * would stand any thing almost but the * result * had attacked and had been repulsed what course would lee now * would he retire retire the army of northern virginia lose heart at a mere * lees * army give up the great invasion after a mere * troops and commander alike * from the very thought one more trial of * attack * a retreat that was the spirit of the army on the night of the second of july a * movement to draw the enemy out of their works or a second attack remained lee determined to attack longstreet and ewell had accomplished nothing by * the right and left of the enemy lee resolved now to throw a column against its * * the * * and * into the gap with the whole army when all would be over that was * you will say perhaps today reader and you have this immense * to advance that it failed ah these * after the event they are so fatal and so very easy right or wrong lee resolved to make the attack and on the third of july he carried out his resolution if the writer of the south * from * the bloody * of longstreet much more gloomy is the task of * that last charge at gettysburg it is one of those scenes which lees old soldiers approach with * that thunder of the guns which comes back to memory seems to issue * and * from a thousand * let us pass over that tragedy rapidly it must be touched on in these * i leave it soon it is the third of july 1863 lees line of battle * along the crest of seminary ridge * the signal for a new conflict with a * as great as on the * day the infantry are laughing * * their rations and * their * the ragged * with * eyes smiling lips and faces * with * are standing in * or lying down around the pieces of artillery near the centre of the line a * officer in plain uniform and entirely * has dismounted and is * the federal position through a

with * not a * * he * a * then he * the * * them * and his calm glance passes along the lines of his army you would say that this glance * the forest that he * his old soldiers gay * * by the * of longstreet and * in themselves and in him the blood of the soldier * to that thought the face of the great commander suddenly * he * a staff officer and * a few words in calm and * tones the order is given the grand assault is about to begin that assault is going to be one of the most desperate in all history longstreets has been * will be mad and full of * fury at round top blood * the earth is going to be * with it gettysburg is to witness a charge * that of the six hundred * at * each soldier will feel that the fate of the south * on him perhaps if the * * the * * * it from end to end the * will enter after * work will be * red flag of the south will * in triumph over a last and decisive field picketts division of virginia troops has been selected for the * venture and they prepare for the * in the midst of a profound silence since the morning * a * has been heard now and then only a single cannon like a * * its * through the hills those two * the army of northern virginia and the army of the potomac are * and about to spring at one oclock the moment seems to have arrived along the whole front of hill and longstreet the southern artillery all at once * forth one hundred and * cannon send their threatening thunder across the peaceful valley from cemetery heights * pieces reply to them and for more than an hour these two hundred and twentyfive cannon * the air with their * roar * back in * after * from the * * that thunder is the most terrible yet heard in the war it * the * veterans general * the composed and * soldier is going to say of it their artillery fire was most * was the most * * i ever witnessed and the most * it was a most * and * * one possibly hardly ever * for nearly two hours lee * this * fire the federal guns * and shell crossing each other * across the blue sky * the * or * in * of iron * suddenly the federal fire * and then * their ammunition has run low or they are * by the southern fire lees guns also * firing the hour has come the * under pickett form in double line in the edge of the woods where lees centre is posted these men are ragged and * but their * and * * like silver from the * * as the men move * * from the cemetery heights the enemy watch that * * gray line of * drawn up for the charge at the word they move out shoulder to shoulder at common time * the slope they enter on the valley and move steadily toward the heights the advance of the column with its * * * and its ranks closed up and dressed with the * of troops on * is a magnificent spectacle old soldiers * in the * of battle and not given to emotion * forward watching the advance of the * with fiery eyes you would say from the fierce * of the * hands on the * that they wish to follow and many wish that the column is * the valley and beginning to move more rapidly when suddenly the federal artillery * the ranks are swept by round shot shell and * bloody * appear but the line * up and * to advance the fire of the federal artillery * all the * of the * seem * * * and * the * column is torn by a * of * before which men fall in * * * with blood their * torn to pieces their hands * the grass their teeth * the earth the ranks however close up as before and the * continue to advance from common time they have passed to quick * they march at the * that is to say they run they have reached the slope the enemys breastworks are right before

* * sudden * of * from behind a stone wall the federal infantry rise up and * a * fire into the * column it has been accompanied to this moment by a body of other troops but those troops now * like dry leaves swept off by the wind the * still advance amid a * fire of infantry and artillery in their front and on both * they pass over the ground between themselves and the enemy * the slope rush * at the breastworks storm them strike their * into the enemy who * before them and a wild cheer * making the blood * in the * of a hundred thousand men the federal works are carried and the troops are wild with enthusiasm with a thunder of cheers they press upon the flying enemy toward the crest alas as the smoke * they see what is enough to * the * they have * the first line of works only beyond is another and a stronger line still behind it * the heavy * of the enemy ready for the * but the column can not pause it is do or die in their faces are thrust the * of * * flame whole ranks go down in the fire the * close up utter a fierce cheer and rush straight at the second * of works then is seen a spectacle which will long be remembered with a * of the heart by many the * ranks of the * are advancing * into the very * of death they go * are * at every step death * them the furious fire of the enemy on both * and in their front * them back * and dying the brave garnett is killed while leading on his men * is lying on the earth * for life * is mortally wounded at the moment when he * upon the * waves his hat on the point of his sword and * and * of fifteen field officers * have fallen * of the men are dead wounded or prisoners the federal infantry has closed in on the * and rear of the * corps assault the * little band is * and cut off from * turn and face the enemy * to * and die when the smoke * away all is seen to be over it is a * * * * only of the brave division that is coming back so slowly yonder they are swept from the fatal * by * cheers * * and * as they * retire before the * * the wounded are seen to * and fall over the dead and dying * the * amid * of * and the roar of cannon all but a * of picketts * pass into * i was * * at the field covered with * * back amid a great * of shell when a mounted officer rode out of the smoke in his right hand he carried his drawn * left arm was thrown around a wounded boy whom he supported on the * of his saddle in the * i recognized general davenant whom i had seen near the village of paris and who was now * known to me in the boy i recognized the * * with the * * and * cap i * toward him your son i said and i pointed to the boy he is dying i think colonel was the reply in a * voice the gray * trembled and the eye of the father rested * but fiery on the boy such a child i said could he have gone into the charge i could not prevent him came in a * almost from the old * i * him but he got a * somewhere and went over the breastworks with the rest i saw him then for the first time and heard him laugh and cheer a moment afterward he was * caught and raised him up and i have * back through the fire trying to * * he is dying look his wound is * i * so * mere * was any one * than my poor child a * followed the words and * down the old * kissed the pale cheek of the boy i made no reply something seemed to * me suddenly a grave voice uttered some words within a few * of us and i turned quickly it was general * * amid the smoke and * the * never have i seen a human being more composed general davenant * and * we are cut to pieces general he said with something like a fiery * in his eye we did our best and we drove * were not supported my * brave old brigade is gone this is my * brought him * he is dying too the * tones and fiery tears of the old * made my heart beat i could see a quick * rise to the face of general lee he looked at the pale face of the boy over which the * * fell with a glance of * sympathy and * then * out his hand he pressed the hand of general davenant and said in his deep grave voice this has been a sad day for us * sad day but we cannot expect always to gain * never * this has been my fault it is i who have lost this fight and you must help me out of it in the best way you can as he uttered these * words general lee * and disappeared in the smoke general davenant followed bearing the wounded boy still upon his saddle ten minutes afterward i was riding to find general stuart who had sent me with a message just before the charge i had gloomy news for him the battle of gettysburg was lost the sun was * red and * when i reached stuart beyond the left wing of the army from the afternoon of the second to this night of the third of july the cavalry had met that of the enemy in * conflict the columns had * together general hampton had been severely wounded in a * * with * while leading his men stuart had * escaped death or capture in the * and fitz lee had fought * to * with the federal * * them and coming back laughing as was his wont all these scenes i have passed over however the greater * absorbed me the gray * were fighting * but what was that * of * when the fate of gettysburg was being decided at cemetery hill so i pass over all that and * on now to the * memory * few scenes to * it in the days that followed gettysburg but i beg the reader to * that i should have no scenes of a * character to draw never was army less * than that of lee after this fight do you doubt that statement reader do you think that the * were a * * flying before the federal * a * of * * * back to the potomac with the bay of the federal * in their ears that * by a number of our northern * entirely * lees army was not even * it was * hungry out of ammunition and it * not until it had remained for * hours in line of battle in front of the enemy perfectly * of even * attack i should have * nothing better than to have been attacked said longstreet and have no doubt i should have given those who tried as bad a reception as pickett received it may be said that this is the * of the defeated side but general meade when * before the war committee stated the * facts my opinion is now said meade that general lee * that position not from the fear that he would be * from it by any active operations on my part but that he was fearful a force would be sent to harpers ferry to cut off his * that was what caused him to retire did you discover asked one of the committee after the battle of gettysburg any * of * in lees army no sir was general meades reply i saw nothing of that kind that statement was just and general meade was too much of a gentleman and soldier to * it he knew that his great adversary was still * and * the * * on round top and cemetery heights might turn to * if the wounded * were * in his own position after the * of picketts column on the third of july lee had the choice of two * either attack again or retire meade was evidently determined to remain on the defensive to * him lee must once more charge the cemetery heights but a third failure might be * the confederate ammunition was nearly exhausted the * with the potomac were * lee determined to retire that is the true history of the matter the force which fell back before meade was an army of veterans with * * it required only a glance to see that these men were still dangerous they were ready to fight again and many * at the retreat like lees old war horse they were anxious to try another struggle to have the enemy return the * and come over to charge them then commenced that singular retreat the trains retired in a long line * over many miles by the * road while the army marched by the * route between the trains and the enemy ready to turn and * the blue * if they attempted to * so the famous army of northern * in defeat as in * its slow way back toward the soil of virginia never was spectacle stranger than that retreat from gettysburg the * wounded had been sent with the army trains but many insisted upon keeping their places in the ranks there was something grim and terrible in these * arms and faces and * of lees old * you did not think of that as you looked into their pale faces what struck you in those eyes and lips was the fire and the smile of an * courage never had i witnessed resolution more splendid and * in the ragged foot soldiers of the old army i could see plainly the * of a * which no * could shake was it * the * confidence through all in lee i know not but it was there these men were utterly * whether the enemy followed them or not they were retreating * the terrible scenes through which they had passed the * of horror the * * the blood agony death of the last few days had passed away from their memories and they went along with supreme * ready to fight at any moment and certain that they could * any enemy who * them general meade did not attempt that he kept lee at * and followed so slowly that the * were in * * and looked de * en * on * this * soldier who had not cut lee to pieces between meade however and the bold * there was this * difference the soldier knew the * of the man and the army * from gettysburg the * did not meade * the * of his victory over lee the * would have lost them at * lee halted and drew up his army in line of battle the potomac * by * presented an * * meade following slowly was met at every step by stuarts cavalry but finally * his adversary every thing * a great battle and lees cannon from the hills south of * laughed come on but general meade did not come lee standing at bay with the army of northern virginia was a formidable adversary and the federal commander had little desire to charge the confederates as they had charged him at * position day after day the * remained in line of battle * each other lee neither invited nor declined battle at last the potomac * lee put his army in motion and crossing on a * at falling waters took up his position on the south bank of the river stuart followed bringing up the rear with his cavalry column and the whole army was once more on the soil of virginia they had come back after a great march and a great battle the march carried their * to the south bank of the * the battle resulted in their retreat to the south bank of the potomac thus nothing had been gained and nothing lost but alas the south had * on a great and decisive victory when lee failed to * that from the bloody heights of * for want of ammunition and to guard his * he returned to the * the people began to lose heart and say that since the death of jackson the cause was lost gettysburg in fact is the turning point of the struggle from that day * the * of the southern arms at chancellorsville the * steps of victory * stopped at gettysburg the steps began to * into the valley of defeat and the shadow of death what i shall show the reader in this final * of my * is lee and his * and * of the old army of northern * on to the end true in defeat as in victory in the dark days as in the * up the thin ranks and standing by the colors to the last that picture may be * it will be * too crossing to the south bank of the potomac stuart established his headquarters at the * an old mansion on the * the family at the ancient hall were stuarts * friends and our appearance now with the red flag * and the * * a gay * as we * the hill was * with enthusiasm and * all at the * loved stuart they love him today and will love him always his * were * on a * * in the * grounds beneath some ancient * * those seen in english * it was a charming spot through the * in the summer * you saw the old walls of the hall at the foot of the hill the * stole away around the base of a * * its right bank * with immense * * beyond extended a range of hills and in the far west the north mountain mingled its * * with the blue of the summer sky such was the beautiful * which greeted our eyes such the spot to which the winds of war had * us good old * and good days there how well i remember you after the long hard march and the * fighting it was charming to * down for a brief space in this * listen * to the * of the * or the voice of the summer winds amid the * of the century * the great tree on the * * under which stuart * his own tent is called stuarts oak to this day no * will ever * it i hope gold could not * it for tender hearts * the * trunk and huge * as a * of the great soldier whom it * in that summer of 1863 so we were * for a little space and enjoyed * the * of this summer * on the * soon the * would sound again and new * would * us meanwhile we laughed and sang * the * of the peaceful hours * the * listening to the birds and * * for myself i had more dreams than the rest of the gray people there the * was not a strange place to me my * of the staff used to laugh and say that wherever we went in virginia i found * i found near and dear ones at the old house on the * and a hundred * which recalled my lost youth every object carried me back to the days that are dead the blue hills the stream the great * and the hall smiled on me how familiar the * and wide * and * * the pictures of * scenes with ladies and gentlemen in the * * the * of famous * hanging between guns * and * in the wide * were not mere dead * but old and * * i had known them in my childhood looked with delight upon them in my * now they seemed to * me * you remember us thus the hall the grounds the pictures the most * object brought back to me in that summer of 1863 a hundred memories of the years that had * years of childhood and youth of * and joy such as we felt before war had come to * us when i * in the * or * the hills looking into bright eyes where life was so fresh and so young the * was on the * then the flower in the * now the * had passed away and the * * up in the hot * it was a worn and weary soldier who came back to the scenes of his youth suddenly as i * thus * * under the great oak which * me i heard a voice from stuarts tent sending its * music on the air it was the great * singing * the * is on the * at all hours of the day you could hear that gay voice stuarts headquarters were full of the most * sounds and * the * was alive with * * the horses * to the * * their * and * * the bright * shone under the * covered with gay * young officers with * * and * * moved to and fro in front of the headquarters tent the red * caught the sunshine in its * folds suddenly a new * is added to the * scene * figures advance over the * lawn bright eyes * * * are lifted by the fingers of the wind * laughter is * over all * the wild * music of the * the days pass rapidly thus the nights bring * not sleep the general goes with his staff to the * mansion and soon the great drawingroom is full of music and laughter the song the dance the * * follow the long hours * by like a * of summer birds and * our old friend * is the king of the * for * * as before on his * and the old gray horse * still in * youth it is the same old * with his * and * courtesy his * smile his * skill in * on the * listen his voice * again as in the days of # and # he is singing still oh * * help this * * come back come back * out of the window i did * sweet * and the grand magnificent * which * you to * the cavalry * * to him yonder with a * of the * the * * the brave whose voice * thunder the * and * of stuart whom he loves and * * on you laugh loud as you listen the * * * than all and the great apartment is full of * and * and dance then the * * back exhausted a deep silence follows * has made you laugh and is now going to make you sigh listen you can scarcely believe that the * is the same person who has just been * through the old gray horse * is no longer * his voice * instead of laughing he is singing his tender and exquisite * flowers he is telling you in tones as soft as the sigh of the wind in the great * how the cold * winds of december stole my flowers my companions from me alas the cold * winds of the coming winter will blow over the grave of the prince of * * the pride and * of the cavalry headquarters is going to pass away and leave his comrades and his * forever you would say that the future * its shadow on the present * tones are so sweet and * that many eyes grow * * he has tears in his voice the * * * and sigh through the old hall when they die away like a wind in the distance the company remain silent * in sad and * * suddenly stuart * up and * stop that * you will make everybody die of the * sing the old gray horse again or * the cavalry * smiles and * then the gay song ended he * a * the * * his flying fingers race over the * * and * * from end to end of the great * the walls the old people in * and * * look down smiling on their little * o gay summer nights on the banks of the * you have * but * still in memory in the autumn of # i * the old hall where those summer days of 1863 had passed in * and * and then i * away to the * * where stuarts oak still stands the sight of the great tree brought back a whole world of memories seated on one of its huge * beneath the * of * just touched by the finger of autumn i seemed to see all the past rise up again and move before me with its gallant figures its bright scenes and * eyes alas those days were dust and stuart sang and laughed no more the grass was green again and the birds were singing but no * * moved there no * * no voice was heard stuart was * sword * under the dry leaves of * and his * was * forever that hour under the old oak in the autumn of # was one of the * that i have ever spent the hall was there as before the clouds floated the stream * the wind sighed in the great tree as when stuarts tent shone under it but the * had * the laughter was * was a company of * that gathered around me and their faint voices * from another world but this is a book of incident worthy reader we have little time for * * the * are brief the * is * to horse events * us and we are again in the saddle those gay hours on the * were too agreeable to last the old hall was a sort of * in the * of war only we paused for an instant rested under the green trees heard the * of the * the * moved * the * * once more and the coming * stuarts headquarters * bade our kind friends * * set out for the * * lees column was then marching the short * had been succeeded by new * meade was advancing along the east slope of the blue ridge to cut lee off from richmond but the * succeeded no better now than in 1862 meade failed as mcclellan had failed before him the army passed the blue ridge drove back the force sent to * them in flank as they moved and * to culpeper from which they withdrew behind the rapidan here lee took up his position crowned the south bank with his artillery and * general meade * the north bank rested such had been the result of the great campaign in its merely military * lee had * the north delivered battle on the territory of the enemy suffered a * retired and was again * nearly the same ground which he had occupied before the advance moving * and forward on the great * of war the two * seemed to have gained or lost nothing the one was not flushed with victory the other was not * by defeat each went into camp ceased active operations and prepared for the new conflict which was to take place before the end of the year i shall record some * of that rapid and * campaign beginning and * in the month of october then i pass on to the more important and * pages of my * the mighty struggle between lee and grant to return for a moment to the cavalry it held the front along the rapidan and * * from madison courthouse on the left to chancellorsville on the right stuart kept his * on all the fords of the two * having his headquarters in the forks of the * not far from their junction i should like to speak of the charming hours spent at the * mansion near which headquarters had been established the sun shone bright at the house on the * hill but not so bright as the eyes which gave us friendly welcome years have passed since that * things have * neither time or the new scenes will * from some hearts the memory of that beautiful face and the music of that voice we * today as we * in the * and happiness attend the fair face and the kindly heart i saw much of mohun in those days and became in course of time almost his * friend he exhibited still a marked reserve on the subject of his past life but i thought i could see that the * was * day by day he grew * his * seemed leaving him who was this singular man and what was his past history i often asked myself these * * in giving me no * to the * i felt a * that some day i should * out the heart of his * so much in passing for my relations with mohun we had begun to be friends and the chance of war was going to throw us together often i had caught one or two * of a past full of strange * the hours that were coming i was to have every * revealed meanwhile lee was resting but preparing for another blow his army was in the highest spirits the camps * and laughed and were full of * gettysburg was forgotten or if remembered it only served to * the troops and * them with a passionate desire to try again in the * of a new victory the old defeat would * such was the condition of things in the army of northern virginia in the first days of october 1863 it soon became * that lee had resolved to strike a blow at his adversary how to do so with advantage seemed a hard * between the * lay the rapidan which would be an * * in the path of an army retreating after * the same * which * general meade from * lee * to prevent a like movement on the part of his adversary thus an advance of the southern army on the enemys front was far too * to be thought * the only course left was to * their flank this could either be done by crossing lower down and * the enemy off from the rappahannock or crossing higher up and * him off from manassas lee determined on the * in a bright morning early in october the great movement began leaving fitz lees cavalry and a small force of infantry in the works on the rapidan * the enemy general lee put his columns in motion for the upper fords the men * the movement with cheers of delight as they wound along with glittering * through the hills and across the river you could easily see that the old army of northern virginia was still in full * gettysburg had not * * that lee could count on it for new * and * * than any in the past the head of the column was directed toward madison courthouse which would enable lee either to advance directly upon the enemys flank by the * road or continue his flank movement pass the rappahannock and cut off his * from washington the advance was an * spectacle the weather was magnificent and the crimson * of the wood * the * of the red * * above the long glittering * of * stuarts cavalry had moved out on the right flank to protect the column from the observation of the enemy the campaign of october 1863 had opened it was to be one of the * but most * movements of the war * little it was yet rich in incident and * scenes a brilliant * as it * * with * that rapid and * * of lees whole army on meade blood * laughter * were * mingled in the cavalry movements at least and to these i proceed from the heights whence you see only the great events the movements of armies and the decisive battles let us now * into the * good reader i will lay before you some * not to be found in the official reports and i promise to carry you on rapidly it was a magnificent morning of october stuart leaped to saddle and * by his red flag * * in the wind set out from his headquarters in the direction of the mountains he was * on his last great cavalry * it was to be one of his most successful and splendid the great soldier as he advanced that morning was the * * of a * his black * floated * his * * his eyes * with joy his huge * * with laughter his voice was gay * full of * of life health the grand autumn and the * and splendid scenes which his imagination painted on his brow he seemed already to feel the breath of victory it was rather an immense * than a man which i looked at on that morning of october 1863 grand physical health a perfectly * soul the * * for action a * * which nothing could break * this could be seen in the face and form of stuart as he advanced to take command of his column that day on the next morning at daylight he had struck the enemy their * of cavalry supported by infantry were at * mountain a small range above the little village of james city here stuart came suddenly upon them and drove in their * moment afterward he was * forward with the * of a * after a * a * came to meet him from the advance guard riding at full gallop well said stuart a regiment of infantry general where yonder in the gap and he pointed to a * in the little mountain before us stuart * and * to gordon the brave north * who had made the * charge at * in 1862 when * was attacked front and rear by the federal cavalry we have flushed a regiment of infantry gordon can you break them i think i can general the handsome face of the soldier * bright eyes flashed all right get ready then to attack in front i will take young and strike them at the same moment on the right flank with which words stuart went at a gallop and joined young that gay and gallant * was at the head of his column in his * eyes and the smile which showed the white teeth under the black * i saw the same expression of reckless courage which i had noticed on the day of * when the young * broke the column on the hill stuart explained his design in three words are you ready all ready general and * * flashed from the * at the same instant the * of * in front indicated * charge young * to the head of his column charge he * and leading the column he * like a * on the enemys flank as he did so * men rushed with wild cheers into the * * * * * * in five minutes the federal infantry some three hundred in number were scattered in * flight leaving the ground * with new * whose * shone like * silver good stuart exclaimed as long lines of prisoners appeared going to the rear a fair beginning at least and he rode on rapidly the cavalry pressed forward without * and reached the hills above james * * name but the city was a small * mere village * down amid an * of hills on the opposite range we saw the enemys cavalry drawn up and as we afterward learned commanded by general * they presented a handsome spectacle in the gay autumn sunshine but we did not attack them stuarts orders were to protect the march of ewell from observation and this he accomplished by simply holding the federal cavalry at * so a * only was made skirmishers advanced and engaged the enemy the whole day thus passed in * failure to drive the federals a single incident marked the day stuart had taken his position with his staff and * on a hill here with his * * he watched the * then gradually the whole party stretched on the grass began to * they were to have a rude * i was lying holding my * half asleep when an * seemed to open beneath me a * like thunder accompanied it i rose quickly covered with dust a glance explained the whole the enemy had directed a gun upon the * group over which the flag rose and the * had fallen and burst in our midst * of all no one was hurt stuart laughed and mounted his horse a good shot he said look at * hat which on examination i found covered half an * deep with earth in fact the shell had burst within three feet of my * a line shot and with a little more * would have just reached me then * surry in a most * manner by the * of a * at * the enemy was still in position and stuart had not advanced we spent the night at a * and were in the saddle again at dawn the hills opposite were deserted the enemy had retreated stuart pushed on their * down the * road passed the village of * and near * mountain came on and pushed them rapidly back on culpeper courthouse all at once quick firing was heard on our right what is that stuart asked an infantry regiment general said * one of our * * quickly up the words * upon stuart like the blow of a sword a wild excitement seemed to seize him bring up a * he * we were riding ahead without support bring up the cavalry i am going to charge bring me a * and drawing his sword stuart rushed at full gallop alone and * toward the federal infantry whose * were seen glittering in the woods never had i seen him more excited he was plainly on fire with the idea of * the whole party the staff scattered to * the cavalry and soon a company came on at full gallop it was the jefferson company under that brave officer captain george * charge and cut them down * stuart his drawn sword * as he forced his horse over fallen trees and the * of the great deserted camp a fine spectacle followed as the federal infantry * up a slope * charged as his men * upon them they suddenly halted came to a * and the long line of * fell as though they were parts of some glittering * the * * flame and the cavalry received the fire at thirty yards it seemed to check them but it did not they had come to an * * in another moment the infantry broke every man for himself and making a * the cavalry pursued and captured large numbers for the second time stuart had charged infantry and broken them * on now through the great deserted camps of * mountain he * upon culpeper the enemys cavalry retreated made a stand on the hills beyond with their artillery and seemed to have resolved to retreat no farther suddenly the thunder of artillery came up from the rapidan i was sitting my horse near stuart and gordon they were both * stuart seemed laughing throughout the campaign that is fitz lee he said he has crossed and driven them and turning round i wish you would go to general lee * will find him toward * tell him we are driving the enemy and fitz lee seems to be coming up i * and left the two generals laughing as before in half an hour i had found general lee he was in camp on the * road and was talking to ewell it was a singular * lee * * erect with his large frank * slight * pale with small * eyes and * on his * thank you colonel general lee said with his grave but charming courtesy tell general stuart to continue to press them back toward the river and turning to ewell you had better move on with your command general he said in his * voice ewell bowed and turned to * returned to stuart he was * the federal cavalry from * to post driven back from the hill where they had * their artillery they had retreated on * stuart had followed like a fate gordon sent round to the left struck their right flank with his old * fitz lee coming up on the right * down on their * in the woods around * took place one of those cavalry * which as my friends the * say must be seen to be * if the reader will imagine in the * of evening a grand * made up of smoke dust blood * * * * * * cannon and wild cheers he will have a faint idea of that little affair at * a * * made this fight * * fitz lee had repulsed * on the rapidan followed him on his retreat * him at every * just as * reached * with fitz lee at his * * * on fitz lees rear by the * road and stuart * down on his thus fitz lee was * * * fitz lee and stuart * it was a grand and * * that it came very near being any thing but * to that * * general fitz as we called * as he was between generals * and * general fitz was the man for a * place * his people as he called his cavalry soon cut through to stuart it was a * and heavy fight old * cut off more than he could * that time said a * afterward in * the fight and at one time it seemed that the enemy were going to hold their ground * beyond was * with * and every * was crowned with cannon when night fell however the whole force had retreated and crossed the rappahannock leaving the ground * with their dead and wounded in the * woods near * stuart sat his horse looking toward the rappahannock and laughing still he was talking with brave fitz lee whose * figure * * and eyes * with * were plain in the * i shall show you that gallant figure more than once in this volume reader you had but to look at him to see that he was the * of soldiers and the best of comrades so night fell on a victory stuart had driven the enemy at every step he had charged their infantry cavalry and artillery * * he was once more in sight of * hill where he had defeated them in the * june singular * of war it used to bear us * but be taken with a sudden fancy to * back to the old * see manassas fredericksburg cold harbor chancellorsville * takes its place with * bloody and * in sight of it took place two of stuarts * * both were * by sunrise stuart was * rapidly up the bank of the rappahannock toward warrenton springs meade had retreated from culpeper and was falling back rapidly lee was pressing on to cut him off in the vicinity of * a hot fight took place at * a little village beyond * river and here the enemy fought from house to house but finally retreated stuart followed and came up with their rear retreating over the bridge at warrenton springs on the northern bank the federal sharpshooters were posted in double line stuart turned and saw not far from him the jefferson company who had charged so * at * mountain a movement of his hand and they were * over the bridge suddenly they * the head * had * horses * the * in the centre of the bridge had been torn * was impossible to cross the men * and came back under a hot fire of sharpshooters stuarts face was fiery to the ford he * and * himself in front of the men sword in hand he led them through the ford in face of a heavy fire charged up the opposite slope and the federal skirmishers scattered in wild flight the * virginia cavalry followed them and they were cut down or captured as the column moved on stuart * along the line toward the front he had just * death with these men and at sight of him they raised a cheer * for old * rose in a * from the column stuart turned his face * rising in his * he took off his hat and exclaimed * for the old * the words were * it may be reader but they raised a storm i felt like i could die for old * after that one of the men said to me stuart disappeared followed by * cheers and his column continued to advance upon warrenton ahead of the army he had * on for a quarter of an hour when he turned to me and said i am getting * about things at culpeper i wish you would ride back to * who is there with two hundred men and tell him to call on young if he is pushed i turned my horse you know where young is on the * road * can count on him i am going on toward warrenton and the general and myself parted riding in opposite * i returned toward * river passed that stream and the long * of army wagons and as the sun was * drew near culpeper as i pressed on i heard the long thunder of cannon coming up from the direction of * what could that sound mean had the enemy again advanced and * the small force of cavalry there going on now at full speed i heard the cannon steadily approaching culpeper courthouse all at once as i drew near the village i heard a tremendous * in the streets a column of cavalry was advancing to the * the * of * was heard beyond the town a short ride brought me to the field and all was explained colonel * had been attacked by a whole corps of federal infantry and two divisions of * his own force was about two hundred men and a single gun he had offered an obstinate resistance however fallen back slowly and when about to be driven into the town young had come to his aid then followed one of the * * of the war young was the author of it you laugh sometimes still do you not old comrade at the * you played our friends on that october evening young threw himself into the fight with the true cavalry * * his whole brigade he opened a rapid fire on the advancing enemy and this obstinate resistance evidently produced a marked effect upon their * they had been * now paused they had been full of * and now seemed fearful of some * it was evident that they * the presence of a heavy force of * night having * they halted this was the signal for the fifth act of the * young * * along two miles of front brought up his * band and played the * blue flag and * it was * to the enemy that at least a corps of lees infantry was there in their front ready to * the action at dawn the * was * shared the * of the gallant * that * we rose the enemys whole force had disappeared such had been the result of the * and i always regarded the affair as one of the * * of the war when i left the brave young he was laughing in triumph if your eye * this page old comrade it may give you another * laughter is something in this * * is it not but whether you laugh or sigh and wherever you may be health and happiness attend you in the afternoon i was at warrenton i found the general moving toward * on a * meade had been delayed much by * as to his * * scarcely advanced beyond the * the object of stuart was to discover his position and * that was the work always assigned to the eyes and ears of the army stuarts cavalry and the * * now at the head of his column was on for the railroad along which the enemy must retreat another * was to * came near being a tragedy stuart steadily advanced and about sunset had passed * when as he was riding at the head of his column a * rode up hastily from gordon holding the rear well said stuart the enemy are in your rear general impossible general gordon sent me to say so stuart turned and * back gordon came to meet him the yankee army are in our rear general said gordon come and i will show you and riding to an * he pointed out across the fields in the gathering gloom long lines of infantry and artillery moving toward manassas stuart gazed at them * as he sat looking toward them a staff officer from the front came up rapidly well captain the enemy are in front general infantry yes with artillery stuart looked at gordon a real * he said * * his * have they seen you gordon he asked i think not general well so far all is well there is nothing to do but to lay low and take the * of getting out stuarts voice was never * he looked quietly at the huge column * off his retreat a splendid chance to attack them he all at once exclaimed and * a * out of his * he wrote a * note to general lee i afterward knew what it contained stuart described his situation and proposed that * then near warrenton should attack at * he would open with his artillery charge with his * and cut his way out a good man in blue uniform now gordon gordon sent off an aid and the man soon appeared from top to * he was of * blue and he listened * to his instructions five minutes afterward he had dismounted given his horse to a comrade and was * on foot through the * toward the federal column a moment afterward he had mingled with their column and disappeared other * also in federal uniform were * the whole force of cavalry was * and concealed in the woods then darkness * and the long night of anxiety began the situation was not agreeable stuart was caught in a * * on both * his rear and his * passing heavy corps of federal infantry their numerous artillery and their * columns of cavalry discovery was destruction the only hope was that the enemy would not * our * if we were once known to be * there goodbye to stuart and his men so the long night commenced the hours passed on and still we were not discovered it seemed * that some noise did not * stuarts * but an * eye seemed to watch over him and an * hand to guard him more than once the * of a horse rang out on the air of night and two or three times the * * of a * attached to the artillery startled the silence of the woods but these sounds were * they evidently attracted no attention from the enemy leaning down in their * the men half * by sleep but afraid of a rough * passed * hours looking for the dawn stuart was never * on his horse at the head of his men he * no emotion you would not have known except for his * tones when speaking to some one that he and his command were in a * * place cool and * he was equal to any event certain capture or destruction of his whole force was * thus the night * away we had not been discovered over the trees was seen the yellow * of dawn i looked round the * faces were * from want of sleep but they evidently felt perfect confidence in stuart he hastened to * it no sooner had light come than he placed his artillery in position as it grew and * the enemy were seen just on a hill in front of us * * their * suddenly a single cannon sent its long thunder * and * through the woods from the direction of warrenton stuart rose erect in his saddle and looked in the direction of the sound his eyes * another followed then another then a long * * of artillery making the hills * there was no longer any doubt about the fate of the * lee had received the * * had opened on the federal columns * as that good soldier knew how to attack stuart * to his guns on his countenance was a grim smile attention he exclaimed the * ran to their * a cheer rose the next instant the guns * flame shell after shell in rapid * * through the * * in the midst of the blue * threw them into the * * stuart did not allow the * to * his sharpshooters opened at the same instant a determined fire the great * went at full speed to the head of his * * like an * * and artillery charged the column in front burst through * it as he went and at a gallop the gray * with guns following broke out and were again free stuart was out of the * from one of the * places that a commander was ever in he had * his whole command once in safety he turned like a wild * on his enemies in ten minutes his artillery had taken a new * * had * roar told the army that his * still floated his star was still in the * such was that * affair of * few more curious * occurred in the war a brave officer of the infantry had accompanied us as an * * got enough of the cavalry he said laughing i am going back to the infantry it is * stuart came back laughing from his * the army * his * with joy and cheers they had already * the air with * in honor of the cavalry on that evening at warrenton springs when stuart charged through the ford * for stuart was now the * everywhere and let me add that the * * * enjoyed his * he was brave and fond of * delighted him in his ears praise sympathy admiration * sweet general lee continued to press forward but the golden moment for * meade had fled he had not been cut off in culpeper he had not been cut off at warrenton he was not going to be cut off at * near manassas hill had been sent in that direction to * the enemys retreat but on the afternoon * the * of stuart an * blow was * him on the banks of deep run he came up with the enemys rear guard under their brave general warren * it in front of an * * and suffered a heavy * general * was shot down at the head of his men the brigade was nearly cut to pieces and warren retreated across deep run in grim triumph carrying off several pieces of hills artillery it was a * blow and * the brave hill deeply general lee was no less melancholy it is said that he was both gloomy and * it was reported i know not upon what authority that when he and general hill were riding over the field and hill * to explain the unfortunate affair the commanderinchief shook his head and said in grave tones say no more * these poor dead soldiers buried from the hill above * general lee accompanied by stuart looked out in the direction of manassas not a blue coat was to be seen meade had made good his retreat everywhere he had * the * of his great * in parting from him finally at * had left blood in his * blood of some of lees best soldiers it is said that general meade made this retreat under * that he was everywhere looking for a position to fight a northern * described how sitting with him by the * general meade had said it was like * out my * not to have had a fight did he say that then he was * but he had succeeded in retreating safely he was behind the works of * lee had stopped the pursuit there was nothing more indeed to be done lee must retire or attack the enemy behind their * that was not very * and he fell back toward his old camps on the rapidan nothing prevented the cavalry however from feeling the enemy in their new position and stuart rapidly advanced to bull run across which fitz lee drove the federal * a * toward their rear by stuart followed he moved toward * * to the left and crossed the * in a violent storm advanced next day toward * then striking the second corps of meade and throwing it into confusion by * the impression that his force was lees whole army he quietly retired by the way he had come his * revealed all the enemy * that the attack was only a cavalry

herself into our arms oh i am so glad to see you she exclaimed with her * * * her eyes * taking care to look at me as she uttered the words then a whole * of young ladies hastened out to welcome us

* to you gentle reader what tom told me long afterward he had advanced and been * attacked and been scattered pardon the * of the army and * the * operations of the gentlemen of the cavalry tom was * but laughing too he was game if he was unfortunate he did not even * the material * of * and having led in the young miss * with a * * air took his seat at the table which promised so much pleasure of another description the * * on us tom was * that day and i was drawn into the * of bad fortune suddenly a * of * came from the grass * in front of the house the * of * from a company of cavalry followed and the young ladies had just time to thrust us into the * when the door opened and an officer in blue uniform accompanied by a lady entered the apartment i recognized the * at a glance they were darke and the gray woman there was no * that powerful figure of low * but * * that gloomy and * face * with the black * and the eye * * but with a reckless fire in them from beneath the heavy * the woman wore an * gray riding * seemed a favorite with her her cheeks were as white as ever and her lips as red her bearing was perfectly composed and she advanced with the long riding * thrown over her arm walking with exquisite grace all this i could easily see the glass door of the * had been left * in the * of our retreat and from behind the * and * we could see into the apartment without difficulty there was evidently little danger of our discovery the * had plainly entered the house with no design to search it darke advanced into the apartment made the ladies a bow which more than ever * me that he had been familiar with good society and requested food for the lady she had * none for many hours and was faint he would not ask it for himself * as he was an enemy he bowed again as he spoke and was silent the young ladies had listened * as he finished they pointed to the * and without speaking they left the apartment darke was left alone with the woman in gray she seemed to have regarded ceremony as * going to the table she had already helped herself and for some moments * rather than * the food before her then she rose and went and took her seat in a * near the fire darke remained erect * at her in silence the lady * to and fro pushed back her dark hair with the * hand and looking at her companion began to laugh you are not hungry she said no was his reply and to think that a * young creature like myself should be it was natural i hoped that you would have given up this fancy of * me you can not stand the * i can stand it easily she said when we have a * object * does not count a * object what is yours sit down and i will tell you i am tired you can * the column in ten minutes so be it said darke * and he sat down near her you wish to be informed of my object in going with you everywhere she said and her voice which had at first been gay and * assumed a * * making the * * i can explain in a very few words my * desire i wish to see him fall * * darke * you mean that * you promised to kill him when you next met did you not promise me that darke looked at the * with grim admiration you are a singular woman he said you never forget a wrong and yet the wrong people might say was committed by * him do you say that exclaimed the woman with sudden * in her voice i say nothing madam was the gloomy reply i only * that you hate much more * than i do i hate * hate him * but i would not take him at * you would strike him wherever you met * the * the * think you would dance the * around him when he was dying and darke uttered a short * laugh you are right said the woman * i wish to see that man * expected you to kill him on that night in pennsylvania you promised to do * your promise i will try to do so madam said darke * and i wish to be present on the occasion darke laughed as before that doubtless has prevented you from having our good friend * the woman was silent for a moment then she said no i have tried that * yes by what * was your agent swartz darke waited listening he has three times * him behind the rebel lines and fired on him as he was riding at night through the woods added the woman * said darke swartz told you that he has done so * * you i do not believe that story but i design nothing of that description against colonel mohun i will fight him wherever i meet him in * him if i * no * a * smile came to the womans lips you seem to * the idea * she said darke uttered a sound * the * of a wild animal and a moment after * the * he dashed some of its contents into a glass and raised it to his lips * * he suddenly exclaimed * the glass down * i want * * the woman looked at him * and said quietly what is the matter her companions * were * until the * * united over the gloomy eyes beneath burned a * fire i have seen him * davenant he said in a low voice it is the second time as he uttered these words darke seemed the * of some singular emotion it was at gettysburg first he continued he was leading the charge on the third day against cemetery heights i was there by accident they were repulsed when he rode back he was carrying a * boy in his arms through the smoke i recognized his tall form and gray hair and heard his voice in the midst of the cannon as he * on his men the * face had flushed his breast rose and fell that was the first time he said the second was the other day when he was riding among the enemys guns near * made him out with my * darke bent down and gazed at the floor in silence the fire in the dark eyes had * his heavy under lip was caught in the large sharp teeth all at once a *

subject is agreeable well i can give you intelligence of * swartz has anticipated me what intelligence your friend mohun is in * the womans face flushed suddenly with whom she said ah there is the curious part of the affair madam returned darke and in a low tone he added the name of the young lady * conway the woman half rose from her chair with * eyes and said who told you that darke smiled there was something * in that * * an * on whom i can * brought me the intelligence he said colonel mohun was wounded in the battle of * and * a house where she was * the wounded * and was caught in

* you see their blood is going to * their hands to * in spite of the * of fire that * their people all is forgotten or they care nothing they are yonder * and * and * the tender hearts are * the world is bright to * i am here and you * our hearts out in despair darke stopped * a sound between a * and a * the woman had listened with a bitter smile as he finished she rose and approached him her eyes burned in the pale face like * of fire there is a better thing than despair she said what * and * his arm almost * that man is yonder she said * with the other hand toward warrenton go and meet him and kill him and end all this at once remember the banks of the * sword * grave remember he * you with a deadly * wounded you laughed at * you back when you met him like a * under the * remember * oath break that oath and i will go and kill him myself as she uttered these words a cannon shot * across the woods listen the woman exclaimed darke rose suddenly to his feet you are right he said * you keep me to the work i do not hate him as you * he is an enemy and i will kill him why do i yield to you and obey you thus what makes me love you i wonder suddenly a second gun * from beyond * we will talk of that afterward said the woman with flushed cheeks think of one thing only * he is yonder good said darke and i hope that in an hour one of us will be dead i care not * * you must not * yourself what am i all i have left he said and with a gloomy look he rushed from the house followed by the gray woman in a moment the voice of darke was heard * to horse a * of * followed and the company of cavalry sat out at full gallop toward the firing at their head i saw * * figure the woman * by an * rode toward the rear in a few minutes the company of cavalry had entered a * of woods and disappeared we had hastened into the * and myself and looked now toward the * it was dark with a long column of federal cavalry which seemed to be in great * the column as well as i could make out * at least a division neither the head nor the * of the blue * was * the main body with its drawn * glittering like silver * in the sun i * not many * something was evidently going on and our present * dangerous with a * * to the young ladies who had hurried in i made a sign to tom and ran to my horse my companion did not join me for at least five minutes * began to master me when he appeared laughing and * a * of red * which i had observed in miss * hair with a bound he was in the * saw him turn and make a gay * toward the ladies on the steps and then we set out at full speed across the fields to * stuart he was evidently engaged with the enemy from the front came quick * * and * from the woods on the left flank and in rear of the enemy was heard the rapid thunder of cannon suddenly every thing flashed upon me i remembered stuarts * smile the absence of fitz lee a * had evidently been laid and general * had fallen into it i was not * the gallant fitz lee had suggested the * he was to move toward * while stuart retreated upon warrenton pursued by * then fitz lee was to attack the enemy in flank and rear from the direction of * cannon would be the signal for stuart to turn general * thus * in front flank and rear * * * would probably be the order of the day with him every thing turned out exactly as it had been arranged stuart retired steadily on warrenton when the federal rear approached * fitz lee came in on their left flank and then stuart turned like a * and bore down on the head of their column that gun we had heard was the signal of fitz lees attack those * * came from stuart as his men charged we had set out at full speed to * stuart as i have said but he saved tom and myself the trouble of riding very far he came to meet us at full gallop with drawn * driving the federal * in * before him the affair that succeeded was one of the most * of the war the enemy were completely * but a part of * force made a hard fight * * * * fitz lees artillery * fields and woods around * were full of * and conflict in ten minutes we had caught up with stuart he was leading his column in person at the head of the front regiment rode mohun with drawn * and pressing his magnificent gray to * speed in his eye was the splendid joy of combat his cheeks * his laughing lips revealed the white teeth under the black * it was difficult to recognize in this gay * the pale bitter and melancholy * of the previous june look surry exclaimed mohun we are driving our friend * stuart is down on him like a * you are driving a personal friend of yours besides i said yonder he * darke * smile disappeared suddenly he looked at darke whose * figure was seen at the head of the * column and that glance was troubled and * i am sorry to meet him he said in a low tone why he would not strike me yonder in pennsylvania when i was in his power but he has * to kill you today i exclaimed i have just heard him * that look out mohun here they are in an instant the two columns had * together like thunder what followed was a fierce and * * * * * men * * and falling from their horses which * over the dead and wounded alike i was close beside mohun as he closed in with darke the latter had plainly resolved on his enemys destruction and in an instant the two men were * * at each other with their * they were body to * faces * was rather a * on horseback than a sword fight suddenly mohun delivered a blow which fell upon his * sword hand nearly * through the fingers * arm * fell and he was at his * mercy instead of * his sword into * breast however as he might have done mohun let its point fall and said take your life now i am even with you sir darke * and a furious * * from his eyes then his left hand went to his * he drew a pistol and * close up to mohun placed the * on his enemys breast and fired the * passed through * breast but at the same instant darke uttered a fierce cry mohun had driven his * point through the federal officers * blood * around the * moment afterward the two * had * dragged each other from their * horses and were * each other with hands and teeth on the ground * with their blood one of * men leaped from horseback and * them apart a sword give me a sword exclaimed mohun * and rising to his feet he * at an * * lips * with * * he fell at full length on the body of his adversary who was * in blood and seemed to be dying what is here described all took place in a few minutes in that time the enemys column had been broken and * back suddenly the wild southern cheer rang above the woods stuart and fitz lee had united their forces in one * column they pressed the flying enemy * and * on their rear with * and cannon * was defeated his column in hopeless * stuart * of having driven me from culpeper he is reported to have said just before the fight and now i am going to drive him but stuart was not driven on the contrary he drove * some of the enemys column did not stop it is said before they reached the banks of the potomac such was the * * of the last great cavalry campaign of stuart the affair came to be known as the * * and stuarts old * still laugh as they recall the * the campaign of october 1863 was over lee was behind the rapidan in december general meade struck a blow in turn at his adversary shall we glance in passing at that affair of mine run i saw a spectacle * a sad one * i am * to describe though aware it has little to do with my narrative i have left * mohun and darke in a bloody * yonder near * i ought to * at length how they were not dead and how they in due time recovered but for the moment i think of a fine sight and a * face which i saw in the woods below * let us ride * reader it will not take long in december then general meade crossed the lower rapidan and advanced to * general lee in his works above a * followed meade marched toward * found his adversary behind * near that place * them felt them moved * and forward before * then one morning before general lee was aware of the fact quietly disappeared returning to the north bank of the rapidan you see i have no battles to describe on this occasion reader we had some hard fighting in the cavalry but i shall not * upon that it is some handsome * and a talk with an old woman which i shall speak of the * were * by general meades troops just before their retreat the men had fallen into line at the word moved silently toward the rapidan and had not taken the trouble in leaving the rebel woods to * their * * amid the * * with leaves the result was a splendid spectacle the * had gradually burned * * the * of dry leaves great * of flame were seen everywhere in the woods and these * * grew larger and larger * together became * * about * * all the * i ever saw i think this was the most curious from time to time the flames * along and reached the foot of some tall tree * with dry * then the * would catch the flame would * through the * * the trunk stream from the * above the * * * in * * would roar a mighty * of flame crimson * and * it was a new * of war * by general meade such was the * spectacle which rose a moment ago to my memory now for the sad scene which i witnessed as i rode back with stuart passing a small house a poor woman came out and with eyes full of tears exclaimed * stuart oh child stop a minute are they coming back they have took every thing i * are not coming back stuart stopped he was riding at the head of his staff * by his * not a * of * was seen on his features as he heard himself addressed in that * oh child have they treated you so * he said in his grave kind voice oh yes exclaimed the poor woman * bitterly they have took every * * and ear of corn i have and every thing from my daughter she is a widow and lives near us these are her children my * come to get out of the way and she pointed to two or three little girls with frightened faces and eyes * with tears stuart seemed deeply * under that * heart which never * was a wealth of * and kindness well they are not coming back my good woman he said in a voice of deep feeling you need not be * are gone now the poor woman clasped her hands oh do you believe that child she said do you believe * never come back i hope not at least stuart replied in a low tone she clasped her hands and for the third time * him as child * oh if they will only never come back that scene * me deeply the poor womans tears brought something into my throat which seemed to * me this time the northern soldiers had been * in their * they had not only destroyed the property and carried off the slaves of the * * the * * they had taken the bread out of the * of the widow and the * them bare and * in that * december of # war conducted in that manner is * it not reader the cry of that widow and her children must have gone up to heaven stuart returned to his * in the pine wood near * where he had slept without * by his * all these * nights then the army began to move soon it resumed its former position the cavalry was sent to watch the fords of the rapidan and stuart returned to his own headquarters near orange courthouse * singing as he had left them to advance and meet the enemy what gay memories are * by that familiar name how we laughed and sang in that * in the hills near orange in the cold winter of 1863 stuart called his headquarters * independence but the officers of his staff gave them the * of * * and i * in my * the old familiar * never were soldiers more comfortable than the * of * * stuarts tent was the most comfortable of all he had stretched a large * beneath some * trees and * up the opening at each end with a * * of * * himself there in his * * like some * hood or * of the * in old times the * * and open air life seemed at first to * the bold * nothing seemed * to his happiness lost here in the forest but soon the * * * even the * * and he exchanged his * for a regular tent of the * description with a plank floor a * and a mighty * * * ere long a cheerful fire of * driving away the * of the cold winter nights which were sent on their way with song such was stuarts own * the staff * were * around with their * * of rock the cavalry headquarters was * warm * in the woods * came and went * * * * the horses * from their * * of pine * near by and in and out of the generals tent played his two * * * and * the companions of his * hours we all * together under a broad * at one table music * songs were * * soon alas to be dead was yet king of the * * stuart joined in his songs to the music of the * and not * did the bright faces of fair ladies * on us bringing back all the * of the summer * blue sky the sunshine and the smiles such was good old * * i recall it with delight the * * cut you to the * when you * out on horseback from the * * but in * * all was warm and bright in the woods on the crest above the winds sighed but in the * below the * * laughter * great * * and as though in open * of winter and its * stuart * in his clear and * voice his favorite * the * is on the * so we sang and laughed all those long winter * the winds carried away the sound of * and * notes the long hours of winter thus * by like birds lost one by one in the night of the past happy days happy nights i remember them still stuart is * than one of my dear companions have followed * their voices sound again their eyes again * their friendly smiles * in memory so the days fled * i wonder if our friends across the rapidan who were going to crush us were as gay as the * about to be crushed the future looked * but we * we did right did we not friend that * was not * * of * it is evidence at least of game * * * * * * in * * * it not good fortune wealth and success are nothing * to that for my part i would rather have the equal mind in * things than money in my * or victory the army of northern virginia had that in the winter of 1863 as they had had it in 1861 and # and were going to have it in the dark year and black winter * april 1865 but i * too long on those days at * * the wave of war had * us to that quiet * for a time we laughed and sang but the storm was coming soon it struck us and we left the harbor driven by the * so i * * * lost amid the hills of orange the spot is desolate today and the * wood is silent but for me stuart is singing there now as * will sing in my memory forever it required a * heart to laugh and sing * * in the last days of that winter and the first days of spring 1864 those very figures 1864 tell the story and explain this do they not reader each year of the war has its peculiar * #* is * * * bright faces * of flowers * from

leader grants * force present for duty may # 1864 was according to the report of the federal secretary of war # men lees force present for duty as his army * will show was # men that is to say rather more than * of his * lee afterward received about # * from * columns grant received about # with about # men lee repulsed the * of grant with about # men from the rapidan to * a loss on his adversary by the federal statement of more than # men these numbers may be denied but the proof is on record the * of general grant in the approaching campaign was one of very great * he intended to * * as he wrote to president lincoln and crush his adversary at whatever * of money and blood from 1861 to 1864 war had been war such as the world * it * battles had been * * * gained then the * rested before new * battles more * or * general grant had determined to change all that it had been tried and had failed he possessed a * * the army of the united states in his grasp was a huge * army of the potomac he was going to * that tremendous * * it * like a new * and strike straight at lees crest and try to end him if one blow did not * he was going to try another if that failed in its turn he would strike another and another all the year was before him there were new men to fill the places of those who fell blood might * in * but the end was worth the cost would it * a hundred thousand men into bloody * that was unfortunate but * would the struggle * and * the world it was possible but these things were * the * must be crushed the * must strike until lees keen * was * * and * were * against each * combat was * * must beat down the * or fall from the grasp of him who * it such was the * of general grant it was not war exactly in the old * of the term it was not taught by * or * by napoleon you would have said indeed at the first glance that it * the idea of * in * let us give general grant his just * however he was not a great commander but he was a man of clear brain he saw that * force could alone * the army of northern virginia that to wear it away by * * its blood drop by drop was the only thing * he had the courage to * that * to come back to events on the rapidan in the month of may 1864 lee is ready for the great * now seen to be * his right under ewell * the works on the southern bank of the rapidan above chancellorsville his centre under * hill lies near orange courthouse his left under longstreet is in reserve near * the army of northern virginia is thus posted in * of corps extending from * by orange toward the fords of the rapidan when the enemy cross on their great advance ewell is ready to face east hill will close in on his right and longstreet in the same manner on hills right then the army will be in line ready to strike at grants flank as he * through the wilderness for lee is going to strike at him the fifty thousand are going to order the one hundred and forty thousand to * stuarts cavalry is watching it * from madison courthouse along * river on the left of the army and on the right from ewells camps past chancellorsville to fredericksburg such was the situation on the first of may the two * were watching each * one was about to spring to * now from the heights of * to the * of incident and personal observation for this volume is not a history of the war in virginia but the * of a staff officer belonging to stuarts cavalry may 1864 had come we were soon to be in the saddle the * * of general grant was about to * its * one * was the night of the first of * was sitting in general stuarts tent looking into his * * fire and * in this * i was not interrupted it was nearly midnight and the rest of the staff had retired stuart was writing at his desk by the light of a * in a captured camp * and from time to time without turning his head * some brief words upon any subject which came into his head after writing ten minutes he now said * surry general was my as brief * i think mohun was a friend of yours yes general we became * on the march to gettysburg well i have just received his commission you mean as brigadiergeneral you know i long ago applied for it i knew * he has not been exchanged a great * you miss a pleasure i promised myself i would give you what pleasure general to take mohun his commission with your own hands i am truly sorry i can not you know he was * wounded and we had to leave him in warrenton then the enemy advanced for a long time we thought him dead thus i am sorry i am * the pleasure you offer some day i hope to accept your offer accept it now colonel said a * voice at the door i turned suddenly as did the general at the opening of the tent a head was * head passed * followed by a * mr nighthawk private and * * * in with the * step of a * he was * his small eyes were as * his smile as * his * coat white * and * * * as before good evening gentlemen said mr nighthawk smiling * i bring news of colonel mohun and * in like an * or your * laughed stuart an * i am told that is the bird of wisdom gentlemen you * the * on the head when you said gentlemen replied stuart laughing but how about mohun is he exchanged nighthawk and stuart * round and pointed to a chair nighthawk sat down * not exchanged exactly general but safe he said he escaped exactly general and you helped him i believe so good you really are a * * you seem to have a peculiar fancy for mohun he is the best friend i have in the world general well that * for it but how did he escape i will tell you in a few words general i rather pride myself on the manner in which i conducted the little affair you remember colonel mohun was very * wounded when you defeated * at * it was in a fight with colonel darke of the federal cavalry who was also wounded and left dying as was * supposed at a small house on the * when you fell back colonel mohun was left at warrenton his wound being so severe that he could not be brought farther in his * and here he * until he was * his * was * as a * had passed through his breast but he is a gentleman of vigorous constitution and he * at last but unfortunately to find himself a prisoner general meade had * the country and colonel mohun was * from hospital to fort * as a prisoner of war i have informed you general continued mr nighthawk smiling and turning the * of his black hat between his fingers that colonel mohun was one of my best friends for that reason i went to see him at warrenton and had arranged a very good plan for his escape when unfortunately he was all at once sent away thereby * all my * i followed however saw that he was taken to fort * and proceeded * at once you have probably not visited this place general or you colonel it is a fort and outside is a pen or * as it is called * two or three * inside are * for the prisoners in the * of a * and grounds to walk in except in the space marked off by the dead line if any prisoner * that he is shot by the * whose beat is on a * running round upon the top of the * well i went to the place and found that colonel mohun was confined with other officers in the pen where they had the usual federal * of * * bad * and * * for a gentleman like himself accustomed before the war to every * that * wealth could supply this was naturally * and i determined to * no * to effect his escape unfortunately the * of fort * are very * however to cross the dead line is death to attempt to * is * in * and other * * and to * the * * resulted in having the whole affair revealed after they had received the money it really seemed as if colonel mohun were * to the living death of a * prison until the end of the war since * had ceased and it was only by * a * of very great risk that i accomplished the end in view what was your plan nighthawk said stuart rising and moving to the * where he stood * in the * original i lay my life * exactly that general and nighthawk smiled * i have always observed general said mr nighthawk raising his eyes in * * as it were that there is no better rule for a mans conduct in life than to make friends with the * of * in power a profound * laughed stuart friends are * was your principle yes general and i made one of the * of the * certain major * was exceedingly fond of the * of all evil i made that * acquaintance applied for the place of * in the pen and this place i * by * to pay a heavy * in thirty days this was saturday night on monday morning i presented myself before the gate and demanded * as the * appointed * of the pen i was admitted and taken before the officer of the day in his quarters who are you he asked * the new * lieutenant where are your papers i had them ready and presented them to him he read them carefully looked at me * and said that is * * i looked at him he had a red nose i have some excellent french * captain i said * him at sight of the * * which i drew half from my pocket and exhibited to him i saw his face * you are a keen fellow and know the world i * he said and taking the * he poured out nearly a glass full of the * and * it do you intend to keep that article of * he said for my friends captain i replied with a * which he evidently understood let me see your papers again i * them and he glanced at them all * are in regular form there is the key of the * * on that * take possession and my friend the captain * a second glass of the * and made me a sign that i could go i bowed * took the key and went and opened the * * after which i * out to look at the prisoners in the * the * had seen me visit the officer of the day and go to the * * thus he did not * with me when i went into the * as i was * a good union man and an * of the post such was the manner in which i secured a private interview with colonel mohun we could talk without the presence of a * and we soon arranged the plan for his escape i had determined to * a federal uniform to be * in to him and an hour afterward i left him * to see him again as soon as i could visit * and return with the intended * a strange piece of good fortune * me or rather accomplished my purpose at once i had scarcely returned to the * * and spread some * to sleep upon when the officer of the day came in and i saw at a glance that he was half * in consequence of the large amount of * which he had * in a thick and * voice he * the * * at the post * the article i carried and demanded another * at the * i looked at * that a little more would make him * all at once resolved on my plan this was continued mr nighthawk with * * and smiling as he spoke to make my friend the officer of the day * and then * his uniform and i succeeded

my own citizens dress over all concealed his cap and * beneath my * wrapped the * lieutenant in my * for fear he would take cold and going out locked the door and proceeded to the quarters of the prisoners again the * took no notice of me i found colonel mohun in his * ten minutes afterward he had * his gray uniform with that of the federal lieutenant and watching the moment when the back of the * was turned we walked together toward the gate of the pen that was the moment of real danger outside the narrow gate another * was posted and the man might be * * with the officer of the day or have noticed his appearance * the guard had been relieved about an hour * new * had not seen the officer of the * when colonel mohun put his head through the little window beside the gate * open the gate * open the * presented arms as he passed and i followed * door * behind us thus the colonel was out of the pen continued nighthawk smiling the rest was not very dangerous unless the alarm were given they might miss the * * might have been seen to go into the * * i * colonel mohun in a low tone to proceed as rapidly as possible in a direction which i pointed out the path indicated led to a spot on the island where i had concealed a small boat among some * once across on the * i hoped that the danger would be over in spite of my * colonel mohun took his time he is a cool one he even turned and walked toward the fort which he carefully * the guns * the * and the ground around it that place could be taken nighthawk he said with a laugh and he continued to * around the place receiving at every moment * * from passing soldiers which he returned with the * * and an air of authority which i never have seen * i * to you general that it made the * burst out on my forehead and it was fully an hour before we reached the boat i * in and seized the * for i saw a dozen soldiers approaching us from the direction of the fort for * sake sit down colonel i exclaimed in five minutes we will be lost he did not reply he was feeling in the * of the * coat and drew out a * with a * attached then as the men came toward us he began to write i looked over his * bad habit i * * i read

repeated the words of * note did you ever hear of a * hand general but i must end my long story the colonel wrote this note while the soldiers were coming toward us when they had come within ten steps he * to one of * man came up * the colonel said take this note to the * at once my heart had * to my throat general the next moment i drew a good long breath of real relief the federal soldier touched his cap took the note and went back toward the fort without further delay i pushed out and * across to the * where we soon arrived then we left the boat struck into the fields and pushed for the * station on the railroad on the way i could not * from * the colonel with his * he only laughed however and we went on without * an hour afterward we reached the station and the northern train soon came we got in the cars started and we were en route for baltimore suddenly the * sound of a * came from the direction of fort * a moment afterward came another and then a third a prisoner has escaped from fort * said one of the * near us raising his eyes from a * colonel mohun laughed and said * without * his voice in the least ten to one they have found your friend the lieutenant nighthawk such a

toward me the next moment he threw himself upon a chair leaned his head upon my shoulder and began to * one of his * who leaped into his lap well surry old fellow we are going to get into the saddle look out for your head excellent advice i replied i * you to follow it you think i * myself do you in the most reckless manner for * an instance he laughed i saw stuart was talking to rest himself

leaned his arm upon the rude * above the * passing his hand over his forehead as was * with him a hard campaign is coming surry he said at length more * i intend to do my duty in it and * the good opinion of the world if i do not secure it i have * my life many times and shall not * from it in future i am a * and i intend to live or die for old virginia the * is coming the enemy are about to

for myself i am going to fight whatever is before * win victory with gods blessing or die trying once more surry remember that we are fighting for our old mother and that virginia * every man to do his duty his face * as he spoke in his * blue eyes burned the fire of an * resolution a courage that nothing seemed able to crush years have passed since then a thousand scenes have swept before me but still i see the * * with his proud forehead raised and hear his * voice * virginia * every man to do his duty this conversation took place at an early hour of the morning two hours afterward i was in the saddle and riding toward chancellorsville with the double object of * the * and taking mohun his commission i have described in my former * that melancholy country of the wilderness its * * its roads narrow and deserted which seem to wind on forever the desolate fields here and there covered with * * the * * their * wings the * crying in the * and the * * * amid the * covered with its green * strange and * country * * where death * already two great armies had * there in may 1863 now in may # the * * was again to thunder men were going to * here in a mad * even more desperate than the former two roads * from orange courthouse to * old turnpike and the plank * through * i took the latter followed the * * * through the * and toward evening came to the point where the * ford road comes in near chancellorsville here surrounded by the * * * and * of the great battle already fought i found mohun ready for the battle that was coming he commanded the regiment on * opposite * ford and was pointed out to me at three hundred yards from an old torn down house which still remains there i fancy mohun had dismounted and leaning against the trunk of a tree was * a cigar he was much * and * than when i had last seen him but his eye was brilliant and * his carriage erect and proud in his fine new uniform * that left at fort * and his brown hat * with a black * he was the * of a * ready at a moments warning to meet the enemy we exchanged a close grasp of the hand something in this man had attracted me and from * we had become friends though mohun had never given me his confidence i informed him of * visit and narrative * him on his escape and then presented him with his appointment to the * of brigadiergeneral * for stuart he is a man to count on exclaimed mohun and here * is the order for me to take command of four regiments i * you mohun i hope to do good work with them my dear * i think they are just in time with which words mohun put the paper in his pocket you know the * intelligence he said yes but do not let us talk of it tell me something about * first listen to a little narrative from me and i described the visit which i had made with tom * to the house near * the scene between darke and his companion and to keep back nothing repeated the * of their conversation mohun * his * then burst into a laugh well he said so those two * characters are still bent on making * of me are they did you ever hear any thing like it they are perfect * * for blood nothing more nor less i said the whole thing is like a * is it not a perfect * the very word and i have not a * of a key mohun looked at me for some moments in silence he was evidently * and * his eyes fall played with the * of his sword then he suddenly looked up i have a confidence to make you surry he said and would like to make it this very day but i cannot you have no doubt * that colonel darke is my bitter * his companion is no less even more * some day i will tell you what all that means my life has been a strange one as was said of randolph of * the * of * cannot * it these two persons * to * understand more than you possibly * i do not understand the * made to general davenant i am not the * of his * of any one i am not in * do not intend to * be frank with you friend i have little confidence in * you no doubt * that this strange one whom you have * met on the rappahannock in pennsylvania and near * is the cause she seems to be a perfect * is she not you would say so more than ever if i told you what took place at warrenton and again * * were * together then his bitter expression changed to laughter what took place at warrenton i said looking at him * exactly my dear * was a real * only a * played a prominent part in the affair and you know * belong * to tragedy mohun uttered these words with his old reckless * a sort of grim and * * was plain in his * a * * me about it mohun i said he * a moment well i will do so he said at length it will * you my guest while dinner is getting ready i am listening well to go back you remember my fight with colonel darke near * certainly and i was sure that you had killed each other you were mistaken he is not dead and you see i am not he was wounded in the throat but my * * the * and he was taken to a house near at hand and thence to hospital where he recovered my own wound was a * through the * and this gave me so much agony that i could not be carried in my * farther than warrenton where i was left with some friends who took good care of me meanwhile general meade had again advanced and occupied the * was discovered and removed as soon as possible to the federal hospital where they could have me under guard faith they are * * friends the yankees they are * that every little * and they had no idea of * that tremendous southern * colonel mohun to escape so i was sent to hospital the * caused a return of * was within an * of the * this * me to the * that i wish to * for your * for some days after my * to the federal hospital i was * but am now * that much which i then took for the * of a * brain was real i used to lie * a great deal and one gloomy night i saw or * i saw as i then supposed that woman enter my ward in company with the surgeon she bent over me * upon me with those dark eyes which you no doubt remember and then drawing back said to the surgeon will he live impossible to say madam was the reply the ball passed through his breast and although these * are almost always * men do now and then recover from them will this one i cannot tell you madam his constitution seems powerful i saw her turn as he spoke and * those * eyes on me again they were enough to burn a * in you surry and made me feel for some * but there was * the scene here * retired the next night however it was renewed this time the surgeon felt my * touched my forehead placed his ear to my breast to listen to the action of the heart and rising up said in reply to * earnest glance of * yes i am sure he will live you can give yourself no further anxiety about your cousin madam her cousin that was not bad you see she had gained * as i * from some words of their conversation by * herself as my cousin i was a member of her family who had gone * and * the cause of the * but was still dear to her * heart * affection not even the sin of the * cousin could * the tender * of her love i had * from the right * on * with the confederate * but i was * come back should the * * remain * and the loving welcome be * you can give yourself no further * about your cousin madam such was the assurance of the surgeon and he turned away to other * of whom there were however very few in the hospital and none near me as he turned his back madam looked at me her face was really * and i thought at the moment that she was a * i * her closing my eyes to shut out the vision i kept them thus shut for some moments when i * them she was gone well the * * did not seem * to be * my fever returned throughout the * day i turned and * on my * as night came i had some * dreams a storm was * without and the rain falling in * the building trembled the windows * was a night of nights for some * work and i remember laughing in my fever and * now is the time for * bad dreams and * * to * around me i fell into a * at last and had as i thought a * bad * i felt certain that i was * and that what i witnessed was the * of my fancy what i saw or seemed to see was this the door opened * head was thrust in and remained * for an instant then the head moved a body followed madam the lady of the dark eyes * * toward my * it was enough to make one * surry to have seen the * movement of that * i gazed at it through my * * the midnight eyes burning in the white face half covered by a shawl thrown over the * under that * the right hand of the * * something which i could not make out in three quick steps it was beside me i say it for the figure * that of a * or some horrible thing from the eyes two flames seemed to * the lips opened and i heard in a low * ah he is going to recover then as the words left the * lips it reached my * at a bound something * * and i started back only in time to avoid the sharp point of a * which * my head and nearly buried itself in the pillow on which i lay well i started up and * to seize my * but she suddenly broke away from me still * her * her clothing was torn from her * * toward the * i leaped from my * to rush after and arrest her i had not the strength to do so however i had scarcely taken three steps when i began to * * i exclaimed extending my arms to arrest her flight it was useless a few feet further i * head seemed turning * again * * i fell at full length on the floor at the moment when the woman disappeared that was curious was it not it would have been a * * was more * in being no dream at all but a * what had taken place was simple and easy to understand that woman had come * on this * night to murder me and she had very nearly succeeded had she found me asleep i should never have * fortunately i was * some noise frightened her and she disappeared a moment afterward one of the * came and finally the surgeon when i told him what had taken place he laughed well colonel go back to bed he said such dreams * your * more than every thing else i * without taking the trouble to * him my breast was * again and i did not get over the excitement for some days the * did not return i slowly recovered and was taken in due time to fort * rest you know i forgot to tell you one thing the surgeon almost * me that i had been the victim of * unfortunately however for the theory of the worthy i found a deep * in my pillow where the * had entered so you see it was madam and not her * who had done me the honor of a visit surry an hour afterward i had * with mohun at his headquarters in the woods mounted our horses and were making our way toward the rapidan to * the * this * two hours we found nothing * as sunset approached we * our steps toward chancellorsville i had accepted * invitation to spend the night with him as i rode on the country seemed * familiar all at once i recognized here a tree there a * were passing over the road which i had followed first in april 1861 and again in august 1862 when i came so * upon * and heard his singular * we had been speaking of * to whose brigade * regiment belonged and the young officer had grown * * * as one of the greatest soldiers of the army under whom it was an honor to serve well i said there is a spot near here which he knows well and where a strange scene passed on a night of may 1863 ah you know the country then said mohun perfectly well what are you looking at that hill yonder shut in by a * there is a house there and i * on followed by mohun in five minutes we reached the * our horses easily * it and we rode up the hill toward the * mansion i * it * it was * save that the * seemed * away and the * about to * on the window to the right hung by a single * it was the one through which i had looked in august 1862 there was the same door through which i had burst in upon * and his companion i dismounted threw my * over a * * and approached the house suddenly i stopped at ten * from me in a little group of * a man was * on a grave covered with * grass at the * of my * he rose turned * was * in a moment we had exchanged a pressure of the hand and then turning to the grave that is the last * of poor * he said * in his deep grave voice you know how he loved me surry and how you loved him * i can understand your presence at his grave my dear friend * sighed then * mohun who approached this spot he said is well known to colonel surry and myself mohun then turning to me he added i found a melancholy spectacle awaiting me here other than * grave yes come and i will show you and he led the way into the house as i entered the * and miserable mansion the sight which greeted me made me * on a wretched bed lay the * of a woman and at a glance i recognized the woman * who had played so tragic a part in the history of * the face was * * the eyes were open and * the lower * had fallen in the rigid and * hand was a dry and * * of bread she must have * to death here said * * at the * and approaching it he took the * from the fingers as he did so the teeth seemed * at him poor creature he said this * was probably all that remained to her of the price of her many * i pardon her and will have her buried as * turned away i saw him look at the floor there is * blood he said * to a * on the plank and the other is the blood of * who was buried near his victim i remember i * and * my * fall upon my breast i returned in thought to the strange scene which the spot recalled so * there is but one other * in that * of whom i know nothing * you mean * * * raised his head quickly his eyes * with a * * she is my wife he said the joy and * of my life i no longer read * * and * at my * no longer * surry and try to rush against the * that is to end me god has * a lost life in sending me one of his * and it was she who made me promise to come * and pray on the grave of our dear * * turned toward the door as he spoke and * me to ride with him left the mansion as i had agreed to stay with mohun i was obliged to * five minutes afterward he had mounted and with a * the tall form disappeared in the forest we set out in turn and were soon at * * i shared * * and was * by the sun shining in my face my companion had disappeared but i had scarcely * when he was seen approaching at full gallop throwing himself from his horse he * my hand his face * all right surry he exclaimed i have seen * my command is all arranged i have four * regiments and they are already in the saddle i * you my dear general make good use of * i think you are going to have the opportunity at once you are * enemys cavalry are drawn up on the north bank of the river any firing in front they are feeling at all the fords are you going there at once i will go with you and i mounted my horse which stood * near by * some * of bread and * as we rode on we soon reached * command it consisted of four regiments drawn up in column ready to * at sight of the young * the men raised a * mohun * with drawn * and * to the front a moment afterward the * * and the column advanced toward the rapidan within a mile of which it * and myself riding forward to * at * ford directly in our front the * were engaged firing at each other across the river on the northern bank were seen long columns of federal cavalry drawn up as though about to cross i rode with mohun to the * of the lofty hill near the ford and here seated on his horse beneath a tree we found * it was hard to realize that on the evening before i had seen this stern and * figure * in prayer upon a * heard the brief deep voice grow * when he spoke of his wife but habit is every thing on the field * was the soldier and nothing but the soldier you see he said the game is about to open * to the federal cavalry you remember this spot and that hill yonder i think yes i replied and your charge there when we captured their artillery in august # as he spoke a * firing which we had heard for some moments from the direction of * ford grew more rapid five minutes afterward an officer was seen approaching from the side of the firing at full speed when he was within a hundred yards i recognized * * he was * his eyes still * his * floated his lips were smiling he greeted me * and then turned to general * and reported the enemy * to cross at * i will go then will you ride with me surry keep a good look out here mohun i accepted * invitation and in a moment we were * accompanied by * toward * glad to see you again colonel exclaimed the young man in his gay voice you * me of old times and a young lady was speaking of you * a certain miss fitzhugh i will * * no such person colonel ah you are married last spring but i might as well be single thats the worst of this * wish they would stop it i dont mind hard * or fighting or sleeping in the rain what i do mind is never being able to go home i wish old grant would go home and see his wife and let me go and see mine we could then come back and * away at each other with some satisfaction * was * all the way and i * him to talk his gay voice was delightful we talked of a thousand things but they interested me more than they would interest the reader and i pass on to matters more important * rapidly toward * we soon arrived and found the enemy making a heavy * there it * throughout the day and i remained to witness the result at sunset however the firing stopped and * * invitation to share the * of his * i set out on my way back to orange night came almost before i was aware of it and found me following the * road to get on the orange plank road do you know the * road reader and have you ever * over it on a * night if so you have * a peculiar * it is impossible to imagine any thing more * than these strange * in their * the * * and the * * the * trees with their * * are like * reaching out * arms to seize the * by the hair * * there and you * place your hand on your pistol as you ride along to be ready for some * and * enemy at least i did so on that night i had now * some distance and had come near the lonely house where so many singular events had occurred i turned my head and glanced over my shoulder when to my surprise i saw a light * through the window what was its * the house was certainly * even by the * * had informed me that a * had that morning buried the * there was but one means of * the * and i leaped the * riding straight toward the house soon reaching it i dismounted and threw open the door what should * my eyes but the * figure of mr nighthawk seated before a cheerful * and * * his * as i entered mr nighthawk rose * without * the least mark of astonishment good evening colonel he said smiling i am glad to see you and i never more surprised to see any one than you here nighthawk why so colonel i could not help laughing at his air of * * did i not leave you at our headquarters that was two days ago colonel and this is your residence perhaps i have no residence colonel but am here * on a little matter of business ah a matter of business i think it might be called so colonel which it would be * to * to me however that is a pity for i am * curious my dear nighthawk nighthawk looked at me * with a * smile i have not the least * to * you colonel you are a gentleman of * and have another claim on my respect what is that you are a friend of colonel * a very warm one then you can command me and i will tell you at once that i am awaiting the advance of general grant ah now i begin to understand i was sure you would at the first word i uttered colonel general grant will cross the rapidan * tomorrow evening his whole force will probably be * i expect to * some important information before i return to general stuart to you i am mr nighthawk an humble friend of the cause employed in secret * general grant i shall be an honest * of union opinions who has suffered from the * of his troops and goes to headquarters for * you see they have already * me of every thing continued mr nighthawk waving his arm and smiling not a * a * a * or a * of food has been left me they have destroyed the very furniture of my * * and i am cast a mere * on the cold * of the world mr nighthawk had ceased smiling and looked grave while it was i who burst into laughter his eyes were raised toward heaven with an expression of * resignation he spread out both hands with the * of mr * and presented the appearance of a * citizen * * the most trying * when i had ceased laughing i said i * you on your * * nighthawk they * to be crowned with success but how did you discover this house i was * with its former * mrs * she was a sister of a friend of mine whom i think you have seen colonel what friend his name is swartz colonel not the federal spy the same colonel whom we saw last in the house between * and gettysburg i saw him the other day returned mr nighthawk smiling * is it possible near culpeper courthouse colonel and to let you into a little secret i expect to see him tonight i looked at the * with * that man will be here if he * his appointment colonel you have an appointment yes colonel in this house tonight with what object in * name nighthawk * for some moments before * the fact is colonel he said that i * mentioned my appointment with swartz without * how singular it must appear to you unless i gave you some explanation but i am quite at my ease with * are a friend of colonel * i will explain as much of my business as * will permit to be brief i am anxious to * a certain * in * possession a certain * i said looking * at the * exactly colonel which swartz has * colonel and which he stole from the papers of colonel darke on the night of * combat with darke in the house near * mr nighthawk looked * at me in turn ah you know that he said quickly i saw him * it through the window while the womans back was turned i am deeply * to you colonel said mr nighthawk * for * me of this fact which i assure you is important swartz * to me that he had the paper and had * it in that manner but i * seriously whether he was not * me he is a very * * knows the value of that * and my appointment with him tonight is with an eye to its * from him do you think he will come i think so he would * his soul for gold and that woman he seems to be her friend he would * her for silver after * which * * mr nighthawk smiled this man * me beyond expression his * movements were strange * was singular to meet him in this lonely * more singular still was the business which had brought him what was that paper why did nighthawk wish to secure it i gave up the * in despair well i said i will not remain longer i might * off your friend and to * is out of the question even if you were willing that i should be present in fact colonel i shall probably * some very private matters with my friend swartz so that you prefer i should go mr nighthawk smiled he was too * to say yes you are not afraid to meet your friend in this lonely place i said rising not at all colonel you are armed mr nighthawk opened his coat and showed me a * of * i have these but they are * colonel * i have an * with swartz and he with me what is that that we shall not * the * * only destroy each other by superior * you speak in * nighthawk and yet my meaning is very simple if i can have swartz arrested and hung or he me it is all fair but we have agreed not to fight so if you caught him tonight you could have him hung as a spy yes colonel but nothing would * me to * him ah i have given him my * that he shall have safe conduct i laughed bade nighthawk goodbye and left him smiling as i had found him in ten minutes i was again on the * road riding on through the darkness between the * * my * were by no means gay the scenes at the lonely house had not been cheerful and * that * * with the * of bread in the * fingers that * of blood on the floor the grave of * * the appointment of the * nighthawk with the federal spy all were * and * who was nighthawk and what was his connection with mohun who was mohun and what had been his previous history who was this youth of * wealth as nighthawk had * in whose life * supposed to be dead but still alive had * * mohun and nighthawk are two * i * and i give the affair up with which words i * on and soon * on the orange plank road leading toward mine run as i entered it i heard * on the * * and a company of * * toward me through the darkness as they came i heard a gay voice singing the lines i * up in the morning i * up in the morning i * up in the morning before the break o day there was no * that gay sound it was stuart riding at the head of his staff and * in a moment he had come up and promptly halted me ah thats you surry he exclaimed with a laugh * about here in the wilderness what news i reported the state of things in front and stuart exclaimed all right we are ready for them * * is * are in the saddle hear that * it is a good * * * well * * * well do it too stuart laughed and began to sing never mind the weather but get over double trouble we are bound for the happy land of lincoln as the * voice rang through the * * i thought how fortunate it is that the grave people are not here to witness this singular want of dignity in the great commander of lees cavalry those grave people would certainly have rolled their eyes and * oh how * was not the occasion solemn was it not * to laugh and sing no * it was right and much better than * the eyes and * at home and * stuart was going to fight * he sang * heaven had given him animal spirits and he laughed in the face of danger he laughed and sang on this night when he was going to * against grant as he had laughed and * when he had * against * his proud * floated in front of jacksons veterans and he led them over the breastworks at chancellorsville singing old joe hooker will you come out of the wilderness stuart * on we turned into the * road and i found myself * my steps toward the rapidan as i passed near the lonely house i cast a glance toward the * light had * friend arrived we soon reached * ford and i conducted stuart to * * which i had left at * he had just wrapped his * around him and laid down under a tree ready to mount at a moments warning what news * said stuart * his hand some fighting this evening but it ceased about * general stuart looked toward the river and listened * i hear nothing * and passing his hand through his * he * half to himself i wonder if grant can have made any change in his * the order at least was * brought by nighthawk i said stuart turned toward me suddenly i wonder where he could be found if i knew i would send him over the river tonight to bring me a * report of every thing i drew the general aside i can tell you where to find nighthawk where shall i bring him like * surry i wish to * him at once without reply i * my horse and went back rapidly toward the house in the wilderness i soon reached the spot rode to the window and called to nighthawk who came out promptly at my call your friend has not arrived i said he will not come till midnight colonel when i am afraid he will not see you * are wanted and i explained my * nighthawk * was easy to see that he was much disappointed well colonel he said in a resigned tone i must give up my private * calls i will be ready in a moment and * he put out the * forth in rear of the * a horse concealed in the * * me in front swartz will not know what to think he said as we rode rapidly toward the river he knows i am the soul of * and this failure to keep my appointment will much distress him distress him nighthawk he will think some * has happened to me and mr nighthawk smiled so sadly that i could not * from laughter we soon reached the spot where stuart awaited us at sight of nighthawk he uttered an * of satisfaction and explained in brief words his wishes that will be easy general said nighthawk can you * a federal uniform i always travel with one general and mr nighthawk * the * behind his saddle drawing forth a blue coat and * which in five minutes had * his black clothes before us stood one of the blue birds nighthawk was an * yankee stuart gave him a few additional instructions and having listened with the air of a man who is * the words he * upon his memory nighthawk disappeared in the darkness toward the private crossing where he intended to pass the river half an hour afterward stuart was riding toward * ford as we approached mohun met us and reported all quiet stuart then turned back in the direction of chancellorsville where nighthawk was to report to him before daylight if possible i * behind a moment to exchange a few words with mohun something told me that he was * connected with the business which had * the appointment between nighthawk and * at the first words which i uttered i saw that i was not mistaken mohun raised his head quickly listened with the * attention and when i had informed him of every thing said * well ill keep * appointment for him you i said yes my dear * is a matter of more importance than you think the business will not take * enemy will not be moving before * you said i think that the appointment was for midnight yes mohun drew out his watch * a * which he drew from a small * case just eleven he said there is time to * before midnight if we ride * you show me the way i saw that he was bent on his scheme and said no more in a few moments we were in the saddle and riding at full speed toward the house where the meeting was to take place mohun rode like the wild * and mile after mile disappeared behind * away beneath the rapid * of our horses during the whole ride he scarcely opened his lips he seemed to be * deeply and to scarcely realize my presence at last we turned into the * road and were soon near the lonely house we have arrived i said * the * * and we * up the * toward the house which was as dark and silent as the grave * and * our horses in the * we opened the door mohun again had * to his * and * the * left by nighthawk on an old pine table and glanced at his watch midnight exactly he said we have made a good ride of it surry yes and now that i have * you safely mohun i will * retire why not remain if you think it will * you my dear friend but you are going to * your private affairs are you not they are not private from you since i have promised to * my whole life to you then i remain but do you think our friend will keep his appointment there he is said mohun as * were heard without he is * a moment afterward we heard the * * then his steps were heard on the small * all at once his figure appeared in the * it was swartz the * person the small eyes the immense double * and the * fingers covered with * * were * he was * in citizens clothes and covered with dust as from a long ride mohun rose come in my dear mr swartz he said * you see we * you the spy * it was plain that he was * beyond measure at seeing us he threw a glance behind him in the direction of his horse and seemed about to * mohun quietly drew his * and * it fear nothing my dear sir he said and above all do not attempt to escape swartz * and cast an * glance upon the * does the sight of this little * * you said mohun laughing it shall not be * of that * mr swartz and he * the * and * it in its * now he continued sit down and let us talk swartz * before * * glance his own sank he took his seat in a * chair drew forth a huge red * * * his forehead and said quietly i expected to meet a friend here tonight gentlemen instead of enemies interrupted mohun we are such it is true my dear sir but you are quite safe your friend nighthawk is called away he is even ignorant of our presence here but meeting him would have been different gentlemen i had his safe conduct you shall have it from me may i ask from whom said swartz from general mohun of the confederate army swartz smiled this time then making a * bow he replied i knew you very well * is why i am so much at my ease i am pleased to hear that you are * when i last saw you you were only a colonel but i was certain that you would soon be * or killed there was a * * of * in the voice of the * he did not seem to have uttered these words in order to * his * but to express his real sentiment he was evidently a character good said mohun with his * * of * these little * are charming but i am in haste * us come to business my dear sir i came * to ask you some questions and to these i expect plain * swartz looked at the * * but without * his glance on the contrary had in it something * open and * i will reply to all your questions general he said and reply * i have long expected this interview and will even say that i wished it you look on me as a yankee spy and will have but little confidence in what i say nevertheless i am going to tell you the whole truth about every thing ask your questions general i will answer them mohun was leaning one * on the broken table his glance calm and yet fiery seemed bent on * to the most secret * of the * heart well he said now that we begin to understand each other let us come to the point at once where were you on the morning of the * of december # swartz replied without * on the bank of * river in * virginia and bound for petersburg the object of your journey to * * * and winter * then you * in a * or a wagon in a * general you reached petersburg without meeting with any incident on the way i met with two very curious ones general i see you know something about the affair and are anxious to know every thing i will tell you the whole truth but it will be best to let me do it in my own way do so then said mohun * his eyes more * upon the spy swartz was silent again for more than a minute * on the floor then he raised his head passed his red * over his brow and said to begin at the beginning general at the time you speak of december # i was a small * in * and made my living by * * and * to petersburg well one morning in * * me that it was the * of * set out as usual in my * drawn by an old * with a good * on board to go by way of * neck i had not gone two miles however when passing through a lonely piece of woods on the bank of the river i heard a strange cry in the * it was the most * you can think of and made my heart stop * i * down from my * left it standing in the narrow road and went to the spot it was a strange sight i saw on the bank of the river i saw a woman lying * with water and * she was * dressed and of very great * i never saw any human face so pale or clothes more torn and * the spy paused mohun * his eyes from the light with his hands and said * go on well * was enough to * * what is more * still i have never to this day discovered the meaning of the womans being * it was plain that she was a lady she was * with cold and had cried out in what seemed to be a sort of * when i raised her up and * the * out of her clothes she looked at me so * that i was frightened i asked her how she had come there but she made no reply where should i take her she made no reply to that either she seemed * of her * to make a long story short i half led and half carried her to the * in which i put her making a sort of bed for her of some old * i set out on my way again without having the least * what i should do with * she seemed a * only with a sort of idea that her friends might probably pay me for my trouble some day well i went on for a mile or two farther when a new * happened to me that was stranger * was like a * and you will hardly believe * as i was going through a piece of woods following a * by which i cut off a mile or more i heard * near the road and once more stopped my * then i listened i was * and began to believe in * the * came from the woods on my left and there was no doubt about the * having listened for some time i * courage to go in the direction of the sound can you think what i found general what said mohun in the same cool voice tell me a man lying in a * real grave * and * man with a * through his breast and * with blood is it possible and mohun uttered a laugh just as i tell you * is the simple * truth when i got to the place he was * to get out of the grave and his breast was * * i never saw a human being look * help he cried out in a * voice like when he saw * as he spoke he made such a strong effort to rise that his wound * with blood and he * he * did he and what did you do said mohun i took him up in my arms general as i had taken the woman carried him to my * when i bound up his breast in the best way i could and laid him by the side of the * lady to get a * from his friends too no doubt well general we must live you know and did i not * something for being so * for the use of my * certainly you did is not the * worthy of his * but go on * * is interesting * general it is the * the word of swartz i no longer doubt now if i did before said mohun but tell me the end of your * i can do that in a few words general i * up my old * and went on through the woods thinking what i had best do with the man and the woman i had saved i could take them to petersburg and tell my story to the * or some good citizen who would see that they were taken care of but as soon as i said * to myself i thought he is the chief of * * is one of the * words in the language general some people * and their flesh * when you cut a * or * on a window * it is strange but i have always felt in that way when i heard or thought of the word * and here i was going to have * with the said * i was going to say i found these people on the * * and the other in a * * grave no i thank you we never know what our characters will stand and i was by no means certain that mine would stand that then the * wished to have my lady and gentleman under my eye so after thinking over the matter for some miles i determined to leave them with a * of mine near * neck named * who would take care of them and say nothing well i did so and went on to petersburg where i sold my * when i got back they were in bed and on my next visit they were at the point of death about that time i was taken sick and was laid up for more than three months when i went to see my birds at * neck they had * without leaving you their * no they were at least * they left me a roll of bank * than i thought they had about them you had * them of course when they were lying in your * said mohun swartz smiled i * it * forgot to mention the fact i had found only a small amount in the * * on the * i never could understand where he or she had concealed about their persons such a considerable amount of * i suppose in a secret pocket mohun * that is often * that was the last of them swartz smiled and glanced at mohun what is the use of any * my dear mr swartz said the latter you may as well tell the whole story as you have gone this far you are right general and i will finish the war broke out and i sold my * * and * in a better * is running the * across the potomac and * in * for the richmond * on one of these * i met * in the streets of washington no less a person than the lady whom i had * she was * dressed and far more beautiful but there was no * her i spoke to her she recognized me took me to her house and here i found the gentleman dressed in a fine new uniform he was changed * wound had long * he was * and strong but i knew him too at a glance well i spent the evening and when i left the house had accepted an offer made me to * a new business with that of * * that of spy you mean said mohun swartz smiled you speak plainly general we call ourselves secret * either word * the idea mohun raised his head and looked swartz full in the face his glance had grown if possible more * than before and a grim smile * to the * expression of the spy well my dear mr swartz he said * that is a curious history others might doubt its * but i give you my word that i do not i did well to let you proceed in your own way instead of * * i have not yet done and this time shall return to the * of * at your orders general said swartz whose quick glance showed that he was on his guard and * what was coming mohun leaned toward the spy let us proceed to call names he said the man you * from the grave was colonel darke exactly general is that his real name or a false one swartz * then replied a false one his real name * and the lady is his wife general good said mohun you are well informed i see my dear mr swartz and it is a pleasure to * with a gentleman who knows so much and knows it so * you * my pride general i do you * to the point your story was cut off in the middle after the interview in washington you continued to see colonel darke and his wife i saw them frequently general in the * at their home both yes general where did they live near * pennsylvania where you were on a visit just before the battle of gettysburg yes general very good and rising quickly mohun * the spy who drew back * where is the paper that you stole from the woman that night he said swartz was unable to * the fiery glance directed toward him by mohun then nighthawk has told you all he exclaimed colonel surry saw you * the paper swartz looked suddenly toward * smiles had all * the paper give me the paper exclaimed mohun you shall have gold for it i have left it in culpeper general * me the paper swartz started to his feet mohun caught at his * spy * suddenly a quick firing was heard coming rapidly from the direction of * ford the enemy have crossed mohun i cried mohun started and turned his head in the direction of the sound they are advancing i said but look * spy mohun * drawing his pistol swartz had * by the moment when our attention was attracted by the firing to pass through the door gain his horse at a bound and throw himself into the saddle with an * that was * in one so * at the same moment * * * but the * * * over the * head in an instant he had disappeared in the woods mohun rushed to his horse i followed and we were soon riding at full speed in the direction of the firing as we advanced however it * we pushed on and reached the bank of the rapidan just as * men had driven a party of the enemy over it was only a small body who crossing at a private ford and * the * * had * into the * to retire promptly when they were * the affair was nothing unfortunately however it had enabled the federal spy to * us swartz had disappeared like a bird of the night and all pursuit of him in such a wilderness was impossible an hour afterward i had * stuart such were the singular scenes which i witnessed amid the shadows of the * wilderness in the first days of may 1864 the narrative has brought the reader now to an hour past midnight on the third of may an hour * is to say at midnight * federal forces began to move at six in the morning they had * on the north bank of the rapidan and as the sun rose above the wilderness the blue columns began to cross the river general grant at the head of his army of # men had set forth on his great advance toward * advance so often tried so often defeated but which now seemed from the very nature of things to be destined to * any other * seemed * what could # do against nearly * their number what could arrest the immense * * forward to crush the confederacy a glance at grants splendid * was enough to make the * heart * on this #* day of may 1864 he was crossing the rapidan with what * a * host heavy * of blue infantry with glittering * * of * artillery with their * * columns of * armed with * and * * made the earth shake and the woods * with their heavy and * tramp mingled with the roll of * in front of them a little army of * and ragged men looked on and waited without * their advance what did that waiting mean did they intend to * the passage of that * toward richmond it seemed * but that was exactly the intention of lee it is now known that general grant and his officers * themselves greatly on the safe passage of the rapidan and were * that lee would * to retreat toward the south anna instead of retreating lee advanced and delivered battle the first * took place on the #* of may when the federal army was rapidly * in the wilderness ewell had promptly advanced and about noon was forming line of battle across the old turnpike when he was * attacked by warren and his advance driven back but the real * was behind ewells rear closed * advanced in his turn * warren with fury swept him back into the * seized two pieces of his artillery with about # prisoners and for the time completely * the federal force in his front such was the first blow struck it had failed and general grant turned his attention to * hill who had hastened up and formed line of battle across the orange plank road on ewells right * directed the assault here and we have general lees * to the fact that the federal * to drive back hill were repeated and desperate all failed hill * held his ground at night the enemy retired and gave up all further * on that day to make any * grant had expected to find a mere * while lees main body was retreating upon richmond he found two full corps in his front and there was no doubt that a * of * approaching lee was evidently going to * * was plainly to shut up grant in the wilderness and drive him back beyond the rapidan or destroy him it was * and the fighting was over the two * had drawn back and * down * * and gathering new strength for the * conflict of the next day from the * rose the * * of the two * only a few * were heard now and then from the skirmishers and these * the last * of a storm which had spent its fury i had been sent by general stuart with an order to general hampton who commanded the cavalry on hills right hampton was sitting his horse in a field extending at this point between us and the enemy and if it were necessary i would draw his * it is not necessary however every one is familiar with the figure of this great and faithful soldier in his old gray coat plain arms and * on his large and powerful * and horse ready for battle in the war i saw many great * was one of the * having delivered my message to general hampton who received it with his air of grave yet cordial courtesy i turned to shake hands with captain * * young officer as brave as * and one of my best * an * from the staff attracted my attention and looking round i saw the cause at the opposite * of the * field a solitary * was seen * out of the woods occupied by the federal infantry and this man was * a * making his way into our lines at a sign from general hampton captain church went to meet him and as my horse was fresh i accompanied my friend in his ride the * came on at full speed to meet us and for a moment his horse * the * * like a * bird then all at once his speed * he approached at a * and through the gathering gloom i * above the blue uniform the * smiling countenance of nighthawk good evening colonel said nighthawk i am glad to see you again and hope you are well so you have turned * nighthawk i said laughing * * colonel i could not get off before will you * me where i can find general stuart i will take you to him and riding back with captain church and nighthawk i soon found myself again in presence of general hampton a word from me explained the real character of the * general hampton asked a number of questions nighthawk replied to them and then the latter begged me to conduct him to general stuart i did so without delay and we soon reached stuarts * where he was talking with his staff by a * at sight of the blue figure he scarcely turned then suddenly he recognized nighthawk and burst into laughter well my blue * he exclaimed here you are at last what news is grant going to cross the river nighthawk hung his head and sighed * i could not help it general why * you come before it was impossible general stuart shook his head strike that word out of your * my friend that is good advice general but this time they * me they * every road and i had to join their army well i hope you got the # * said stuart laughing that was another * general but i enjoyed the very best society yonder what society nighthawk that of grant meade and * ah my old friend general * but where are grants headquarters nighthawk tell me every thing at old wilderness tavern general and you saw him there in the midst of his * was * one of his * i understand well their intended movements nighthawk shook his head i could have * you those of today general how i heard general meade * his order through the window of his headquarters and can repeat it * if you desire by all means * will * his * but is it possible that you can do so i can general i * every word on my memory and * his eyes * upon * nighthawk commenced in a low * voice the following movements are ordered for the #* may 1864 general sheridan commanding cavalry corps will move with * and * divisions against the enemys cavalry in the direction of * crossing general * with the third cavalry division will move at # am to * * on the * road he will keep out parties on the orange courthouse * and plank road the * road * road and in the direction of * store and andrews store or good hope church # majorgeneral * commanding second corps will move at # am to * * church and * his right toward the fifth corps at * store # majorgeneral warren commanding fifth corps will move at # am to * store on the orange courthouse plank road and * his right toward the sixth corps at old wilderness tavern # majorgeneral * commanding sixth corps will move to the old wilderness tavern on the orange courthouse * as soon as the road is clear the * voice stopped i had listened with astonishment and found it difficult to credit this remarkable * of memory though it took place before my eyes or rather in my ears it is really wonderful said stuart * you see said nighthawk returning to his original voice so to speak you see general this would have been of some importance yesterday it is very important now said stuart it * grants * wish to get out of the wilderness he is at old wilderness tavern he was this morning general with meade and * you were there i was general what did you * nighthawk little or nothing general true i heard one or two * things as i * among the * near what general grant came out talking with meade * and warren general meade said they have left a division to * us here while they * and prepare a position toward the north * what i want is to prevent these fellows from getting back to mine run stuart laughed well these fellows dont appear to be going back what did grant say he * general and did not open his lips only once when general meade said something about * what did he say i can give you his words he took his cigar from his * out the * replied oh i never * so much the better said stuart the general that does not * * his men and i * that general grant will soon * his * stuart had ordered his horse to be * and now mounted to go to general lees headquarters by the * he said did you hear warren or * say any thing nighthawk nighthawk smiled i heard * utter a few words general what he said to warren i hear hood is to take stuarts place i am glad of it for stuart is the best cavalry officer ever * in north america the morning of the #* of may was * in with thunder the battle of the * day had been a sort of * the real struggle came by a curious * grant and lee both began the attack and at the same hour at five oclock in the morning the blue and gray ranks rushed together and opened fire on each other or rather they fired when they heard each others steps and * you saw little in that * i have already spoken more than once of this * * land of * * * where sight failed and * had to be made by the * the officers advancing in front of the line with * the * here were worse than night fighting the * strange beyond example regiments brigades and divisions * on each other before they knew it and each opened fire * alone by the * of steps in the * there was something * and * in such a struggle it was not a conflict of men * against each other in * * two wild * were * and * each other in the * when they heard each others steps they sprang and * one fell the other fell upon him then the * rose up and went in pursuit of other * dead was lost from all eyes in this mournful and desolate country of the * wilderness did the bloody campaign of 1864 begin here where the very * seemed * here in blind * as at midnight did # men in blue and gray * each * and * of * war had had nothing like it destruction of life had become a * and was done by the * the genius of blood apparently tired of the old * * of * had * the * death in the * of the * on the morning of may #* lee and grant had * and the battle became general along the entire line of the two armies in these rapid * i need only * this bitter * * will describe it lee was * to get around the enemys left and * him up in the * in this he failed just as longstreet who had arrived and taken part in the action was advancing to turn the federal flank on the * road he was wounded by one of his own men and the movement was arrested in * career but lee * to his plan he determined to lead his column in person and would have done so but for the * of his men to the rear * the troops as he rode in front of them to the rear and he was obliged to obey he was not needed the gray lines * forward the * was full of smoke and quick * of flame then the woods took fire and the scene of * had a new and * * added to it dense clouds of smoke rose * and * the * the flames * * * and were * in the * faces and still in the midst of this * * of horrors the * of destruction went on without * at * general lee had driven the enemy from their front line of * nothing was gained what could be gained in that wretched country where there was nothing but * * general grant saw his danger and no doubt * the object of his * arrest and * him in this * where numbers did not count and artillery could not be used there was but one thing to * get out of the * so on the day after this * * in which he had lost nearly # men and lee about # grant moved toward * the * of the wilderness were again silent and the blue and gray * in the * did not move the * had gone to * each other elsewhere in the * and smoke of that desperate * of the infantry i have lost sight of the * cavalry * which marked each day with blood and now there is no time to return to them a great and * event * the pen with one scene i shall * those heroic * that scene will be * does the reader remember the brave breathed commanding a * of the stuart horse artillery i first spoke of him on the night * chancellorsville when he came to see stuart at that time he was already famous for his door die fighting a * by * he had come over to help us had been the * man of * the favorite of stuart the admiration of the whole army for a courage which the word reckless best * now in this may 1864 his familiar name of old * breathed * by stuart who held him in high favor had become the * of * * and * * by that of * to fight his guns to the * or go in with the * best * breathed a * * in combat he * at nothing and led everywhere i saw brave men in the * * than breathed when he failed in any thing it was because reckless courage could not accomplish it he was young of vigorous frame with dark hair and eyes and * by sun and wind his voice was low and deep his * simple and * his ready laugh and * bearing indicated the born soldier eyes * friendly and full of * it was only when breathed was fighting his guns or leading a charge that they * * * and seemed to flame to come to my incident i wish reader to show you breathed to let you see the whole individual in a single * it is good to record things not * in history they are after all the real glory of the south of which nothing can * her i please myself too for breathed was my friend i loved and * * only a month or two before he had made the whole army * laugh * too see how memory * me off i am going to give ten words first to that incident which made us laugh in the last days of winter a force of federal cavalry came to make an attack on * the rapidan high up toward the mountains and * to surprise the place unfortunately for him general * who commanded the expedition was to find the stuart horse artillery in winter quarters near so sudden and unexpected was * advance that the artillery camps were entirely surprised at one moment the men were lying down in their * * * * horses turned out to * the guns covered a profound peace * the next they were running to arms * and in confusion with the blue cavalry * straight on their * * in hand breathed had been * like the rest laughing and talking with the men * made him suddenly king and * in hand he rushed to the guns calling to his men to follow with his own hands he * a gun round drove home a charge and * the piece to bear upon the federal cavalry * in among the * within fifty yards of him man the guns he * in his voice of thunder stand to your guns boys you promised me you would never let these guns be taken a roar of voices answered him the * * at the voice of the master suddenly the pieces * flame shell and * * through the federal ranks breathed was everywhere cheering on the * * succeeded * the ground shook then the enemy gave back * and losing heart breathed seized the moment many of the horses had been caught and hastily * breathed leaped upon one of them and * mount the men threw themselves into the * armed with * others with * others with pieces of * caught up from the * charge * breathed at the head of his men he lead a * charge upon the federal cavalry which broke and fled in the * * pursued by the ragged * breathed in front with * cheers and * of * they were pursued past * to the rapidan without pause that night stuart went after them their officers held a council of war it is said to decide whether they should not * their artillery near * to prevent is capture on the day after this they had escaped in passing * on their return from * one of the federal * stopped to get a drink of water at the house of a citizen * the matter asked the citizen well we are retreating who is after you nobody but old * breathed and his men armed with * such was one of a dozen * in * life let me come to that which took place near * courthouse grant had moved as we have seen by his left flank toward that place general fitzhugh lee opposed him on the way and at every step * the head of the federal column with his dismounted sharpshooters and horse artillery near * courthouse it was the stand made by fitz lees cavalry that saved the position * the * of the whole campaign sent by stuart with a message to the brave general fitz i reached him near * courthouse at the moment when he had just ordered his cavalry to fall back slowly before the advancing enemy and take a new position in rear two guns which had been firing on the enemy were still in battery on a hill upon these a heavy federal skirmish line was steadily moving and beside the guns breathed and fitzhugh lee sat their horses looking * at the advancing line give them a round of * breathed exclaimed general fitz lee breathed * but the skirmish line continued bravely to advance all at once there appeared in the woods behind them a regular line of battle advancing with * * to remain longer on the hill was to lose the guns the * were * around us and there was but one course * fall back take the guns off breathed exclaimed the general there is no time to lose join the command in the new position farther down the road breathed looked * * a few more * general and turning to

at a * gallop pursued by * only a few more * general * breathed i wont lose the guns all right as he spoke the enemy rushed upon the single gun breathed replied by * * in their faces he sat his horse

days of desperate fighting when * all the roads and * * stuart opposed at every step grants advance toward the * but i can not describe those * they must be left to others the pen which has paused to record that * of breathed is drawn * as by the hand of fate toward one of those scenes which stand out * and bloody from the pages of history from the moment when grant crossed the rapidan stuart had met the * of sheridan everywhere in bitter conflict and the days and nights had been * all over with battles now on the ninth of may when the two great * * each other on the * a more * service still was demanded of the great * sheridan had been * to * general lees * and if possible capture richmond the city was known to be well * * of troops and a determined assault might result in its fall sheridan accordingly cut * a heavy column took command of it in person and * like a * toward the devoted city no sooner however had he begun to move than stuart followed on his * he had no difficulty in doing so a great * told the story that cloud hung above the long column of federal cavalry accompanied it wherever it moved and indicated clearly to stuart the course which his adversary was * if he could only * with however small a force between sheridan and richmond time would be given for preparation to resist the attack and the capital might be saved if he failed to * sheridan would accomplish his * would fall it was a * hope after all that he could arrest the federal commander general sheridan took with him a force * at # stuarts was in all about # gordon who was not in the battle at yellow tavern * that action was fought by fitz lees division of # men all told but the men and officers were brave beyond words the * to daring resistance was * they would do all that could be done such was the situation of affairs on the 9th of may 1864 stuart set out at full gallop on his iron gray from * courthouse about three oclock in the day and reached * toward * junction just as night fell here we found general fitz lee engaged in a hot skirmish with the enemys * and that night stuart * an attack upon their camp but abandoned the idea his spirits at this time were excellent but it was easy to see that he realized the immense importance of * the enemy an officer said in his presence we wont be able to stop sheridan stuart turned at those words his cheeks flushed his eyes * and he said no sir * rather die than let him go on on the next morning he moved in the direction of * junction riding * to * with his friend general fitz lee i had never seen him more * some events * themselves forever on the memory that ride of may #* 1864 was one of them have human * a * ever at the near approach of death does the shadow of the * hand ever * itself to the eye i know not but i know that no such * came to stuart no shadow of the coming event * the path of the great * on the contrary his spirits were * beyond example almost and riding on with general fitz lee he sang in his gallant voice his favorite * come out of the wilderness and * the cavalry as he rode on thus he was the * * of a * his seat in the saddle was firm his blue eyes * his heavy * * with laughter at the least * something in this man seemed to spring forward to meet danger * aroused and * him all his * were * by it in that ride through the may forest to attack sheridan and arrest him or die stuarts bearing and expression were * * and * his black * floated in the spring * like some * and he went to battle * a song resolved to * or fall riding beside him i found my eyes * attracted to his proud face and now i see the great * as then clearly with the eyes of memory what a career had been his what a life of battles as we went on through the spring woods amid the * songs of birds all the long hard * of this man passed before me like an immense * the * * and fighting in the * valley the charge and route of the * * at manassas the falling back to the * and the fighting all through charles city the famous ride around mcclellan the advance and * on the rapidan and rappahannock after * mountain the night attack on * when he captured * coat and papers the march on jacksons flank and the capture of manassas the advance into maryland the * at * * and * with the hard * work as lee retired to sharpsburg his splendid * of artillery on the left wing of the army there the retreat covered by his cavalry the second ride around mcclellan and safe escape from his * the bitter * at * and * as lee fell back the hard fighting * on the banks of the rappahannock the * * with artillery on the night of fredericksburg the winter march to * the desperate battle at * ford the falling back before hooker the battle of chancellorsville when he succeeded jackson the * * of * the war of * below * the advance across maryland into pennsylvania when the long march was * all over with battles at * * * gettysburg where he met and repulsed the best cavalry of the federal army the retreat from gettysburg with the * affair near * * the rear of the army as it again crossed the potomac then the campaign of october * with * route at * the assault on meades head of column when he came over to mine run the bold attack on his rear there and the hard * fighting since grant had come over to the * remembered all these splendid scenes and * services as i rode on beside stuart through the fields and * of * and thought this is one of those great figures which live forever in history and * memories today i know that i was not mistaken or * under the influence of * affection and admiration that figure has passed from earth but still lives stuart is long dead and the grass * him but there is * a foot of the soil of virginia that does not speak of him he is gone but his old mother is proud of * she not answer mountains where he * where he * * a * as you * through the * yonder past his grave let me rapidly pass over the events of the * of may * little brigade had been ordered to follow on the rear of the enemy while fitz lee moved round by * to get in front of them stuart rode and met gordon gave the brave north * so soon to fall his last orders and then hastened back to fitz lee who had continued to press the enemy they had struck the * railroad but the gray * were close on them colonel robert randolph that brave soul * like gordon charged them * here took nearly a hundred prisoners and drove them across the road at this moment stuart returned and pushed forward toward * from which point he intended to * on and get in their front about four in the afternoon we reached * church and the command halted to rest stuart stretched himself at full length surrounded by his staff in a field of * and * his hat over his face to protect his eyes from the light * a short sleep of which he was very greatly in need the column again moved and that night * near * awaiting the work of the * at daylight on the #* stuart moved toward * here he came up with the enemy attacked them * and drove them before him and out of the village * * and * a considerable number then he put his column again in motion advanced rapidly by the telegraph road toward yellow tavern a point near richmond where he intended to * the * moment of decisive struggle to which all the fighting along the roads of * had only been the * was at hand stuart was riding at the head of his column looking straight forward and with no thought apparently save that of * in time he was no longer gay was it the coming event was it the loss of sleep the great interest at * the terrible struggle before him i know not but he looked anxious * almost melancholy my men and horses are tired * and hungry but all right he had written to general bragg from * and these words will serve in large measure to describe the condition of the great commander himself i was riding beside him when he turned to me and said in a low tone do you remember a conversation which we had at orange surry that night in my tent yes general and what i said every word is * i think upon my memory good do not let one thing ever escape you remember that i said what i say again today that virginia * every man to do his duty i will never forget that general he smiled and rode on for half a mile he was silent then i heard escape from his lips in a low * voice a * which i had never heard him sing before soon with * ill be marching i know not why but that low sound made me * yellow tavern at the mention of that name a sort of * * me even today when nearly four years have passed in my eyes the * is * a gloomy cloud seems ever hanging over it no birds sing in the trees the very sunshine of the summer days is sad there but i pass to my brief description of the place and the event which made it one of the black names in southern history yellow tavern is an old * * on the * road about six miles from richmond nothing more dreary than this desolate * * can be * its doors stand open its windows are gone the * floor * beneath the * and the winds * through the * * like * spirits * near and * some * secret this is the scene of some * of darkness you are * to * as you place your feet upon the * when you leave the spot behind you a weight seems lifted from your * * * such was the yellow tavern when i went there in the spring of 1864 is it different today do human * laugh there i know not but i know that nothing could make it cheerful in my eyes it was and is and ever will be a thing * for the military reader however a few words in reference to the * features of the * are necessary yellow tavern is at the forks of the telegraph and mountain roads six miles from richmond the telegraph road * north and * this road stuart marched the mountain road comes into it from the * by this road sheridan was coming open the left hand with the * * the * finger * north the * is the mountain road the * the telegraph road where the * * the hand is the yellow tavern in open fields and richmond is at the * toward the head of the * is a wood here * commanding stuarts right was placed his line * the mountain road so as to strike the approaching enemy in flank from * left or near it stuarts left wing under * extended along the telegraph road to the * two lines thus forming an * * on a hill near * right was breathed with his guns the object of this * of stuarts force will be seen at a glance * commanding the left was across the enemys front * commanding the right was on their flank and the artillery was so posted as to * at once the front of both stuarts wings the enemys advance would bring them to the first * of the * there they would receive * fire in front * in flank and * * the cross fire on that point over which the enemy must pass would be deadly take a * reader and draw the * and lines of fire that will show stuarts excellent design stuart had reached yellow tavern and made his * before the arrival of sheridan who was nevertheless rapidly advancing by the mountain road major mcclellan * had been sent to general bragg with a suggestion that the latter should attack from the direction of the city at the moment when the cavalry * the federal flank all was ready it was the morning of may #* 1864 never was scene more beautiful and * the men were * like their horses but no heart * from the coming * * in a thin line from the tavern into the woods on the right of the mountain road the men sat their horses with drawn * * in the sun and the red * waved * in the fresh may * as though * stuart who rode in front of them such was the scene at yellow tavern the moment had come at about eight a * * * with the tramp of * was heard then a * came at a gallop from the right to stuart the enemy were in sight and advancing rapidly stuart was sitting his horse near yellow tavern when that intelligence reached him he rose in his saddle took his * from their * case and looked through them in the direction of the woods across the mountain road suddenly quick firing came on the * loud * stuart * his * shut them up * them in their case and drew his * never had i seen him present an appearance more * his head was carried * erect his black * floated his blue eyes * was the * * of a soldier and as one of his * officers afterward said to me looked as if he had resolved on victory or death i had seen him often aroused and * for action on this morning he seemed on fire and * a * king of battle suddenly the skirmish line of the enemy appeared in front of the woods and a quick fire was opened on stuarts sharpshooters under colonel * in the * of the two roads stuart hastened to take the real * he posted two guns on a rising ground in the * and opened a heavy fire and * by this fire the enemy suddenly made a determined charge upon the guns stuart rose in his * and gazed * at the heavy line advancing upon him and * * * back take back the guns he said they were * up and went off rapidly at the same moment colonel * appeared his men * * every foot of ground as they fell back toward the telegraph road where a deep cut promised them advantage colonel * was a tall * officer with a ready smile and a cordial bearing he and stuart had bitterly * and the general had * the colonel it is scarcely too much to say that they had been deadly enemies for the first time now since their * they met but on this day their * seemed dead the two men about to die * each others hands they are pressing you back colonel exclaimed stuart yes general i have but three * * and you see their force you are right you have done all that any man could can you hold this cut i will try general their * crossed never was stuarts face * if you say you will you will do it hold this position to the last colonel ill hold it until i die general with a pressure of the hand they parted fifteen minutes afterward * was dead attacked at once in front and on both * in the road his little force had been cut to pieces he fell with three of his * and his * were scattered stuart witnessed all and his eye grew fiery * has died the death of a hero he exclaimed order * to * his brigade and attack on the right he added to lieutenant garnett * twenty minutes afterward * men were seen advancing and driving the enemy before them this relieved the left and * continued to * on until he struck up against a heavy line behind * breastworks in the woods he then fell back and each side remained * awaiting the movement of the other such was the * to the real battle of yellow * * of * which * the furious * stuarts melancholy had all * he was in splendid spirits he hastened back his artillery to the point from which it had been driven and soon its * roar was heard rising above the woods at the same moment a * * up what news a * from gordon general stuart took it and read it with high good * gordon has had a handsome little affair this morning he said he has * them and looking toward the * i wish gordon was here he said the guns continued to roar and the enemy had not again advanced it was nearly four oclock night approached but the great blow was coming stuart was sitting his horse near the guns with breathed beside him suddenly the edge of the woods on the mountain road * with blue * as they appeared the long lines of * * from the * then they rushed like a * toward the guns the attack was so sudden and * that nothing could stand before it for a short time the men fought * crossing * and * their * but the enemys numbers were too great the left was driven back with * cheers the federal * pressed upon them to drive them completely from the field suddenly as the men fell back stuart appeared with drawn * among them calling upon them to * his voice rose above the fire and a wild cheer greeted him the men * the enemy were met again * to * and the field became a scene of the most desperate conflict stuart led every charge i shall never forget the appearance which he presented at that moment with one hand he * his * horse with the other he * his * in his cheeks burned the hot blood of the soldier breathed he exclaimed general take command of all the mounted men in the road and hold it against whatever may come if this road is lost we are gone breathed * to the head of the men and * follow me his sword flashed * and * the * into his horse he * ahead of the column * in the middle of a * of enemies a * sight followed breathed was seen in the midst of the federal cavalry * himself with pistol and * against the * which were * at him on every side he cut one officer out of the saddle killed a lieutenant with a pistol ball was shot slightly in the side and a * * laid open his head but five minutes afterward he was seen to clear a path with his * and * * with blood the * * effected nothing the enemy * their line and again charged the guns which were * a heavy fire upon them as they rushed forward the * of their horses shook the ground a * cheer arose from the blue line stuart was looking at them and * out in front of the guns his eyes flashed and taking off his brown felt hat he waved it and * then he * to take command of a column of * men coming to meet the charge they were too late in a moment the enemy were * among the guns all but one were captured and that piece was saved only by the terror of the * they * their horses into a gallop and rushed toward the chickahominy followed by the * who were * them and * for gods sake boys * go back * got breathed * go back to him that terror of the * which the * * so bitterly ended all the gun * on at wild speed suddenly struck against the head of the column advancing to meet the enemy a * * against it could not have more * broken it before it could * the enemy had struck it forced it back and then the whole federal force of cavalry was * upon stuart his right where fitz lee commanded in person was giving back his left was broken and driven the day was evidently lost and stuart with a sort of * rushed into the midst of the enemy calling upon his men to * and firing his pistol in the faces of the federal * suddenly one of them * past him toward the rear and as he did so placed his pistol nearly on stuarts body and fired as the man disappeared in the smoke stuarts hand went quickly to his side he * in the saddle and would have fallen had not captain * of the first virginia cavalry caught him in his arms the * had passed through his side into the * and wounded him mortally in its passage it just * a small bible in his pocket the bible was the * of his * the * had * that it should not turn the fatal * stuarts immense * * him for a moment pale and * in the saddle he still * the field and called on the men to * go back he exclaimed and do your duty as i have done mine and our country will be safe a moment afterward he called out again to the men passing him go back go back * rather die than be * the old * flashed from his eyes as he spoke then a * passed over them his head sank upon his breast and still supported in the saddle he was led through the woods toward the chickahominy suddenly fitzhugh lee who had been * fighting on the right * up and * stuart his face was flushed his eyes * you are wounded he exclaimed * stuart replied but look out fitz yonder they come a glance showed all in the midst of a wild * of * * quick * and * * the federal cavalry were * forward to * the * lines stuarts eye flashed for the last time turning to general fitzhugh lee he exclaimed in a full * voice go ahead fitz old fellow i know you will do what is right this was the last order he ever gave upon the field as he spoke his head sank his eyes closed and he was borne toward the rear there was scarcely time to save him from capture his wound seemed to have been the signal for his lines to break they had now given way * enemy were pressing them with loud * fighting with * * they fell back toward the chickahominy which they crossed * pressed by the * enemy stuart had been placed in an * and borne across the stream where dr randolph and dr * made a brief examination of his wound it was plainly * he was hastily driven by way of * into richmond his hard fighting had saved the city when sheridan attacked he was repulsed but the capital was * * * hours afterward stuart was dead the end of the great * had been as * as his life was * his death was that of the christian * who * to the will of god and * whatever his loving hand * for him he asked * that his favorite * should be * for him and when president davis visited him and asked general how do you feel easy but willing to die he said if god and my country think i have * my * and done my duty as night came he requested his physician to * him if he thought he would live till morning the physician replied that his death was rapidly approaching when he * bowed his head and * i am resigned if it be gods will i should like to see my wife but gods will be done when the proposed attack upon sheridan near * was spoken of in his presence he said god grant that it may be successful i wish i could be there turning his face toward the pillow he added with tears in his eyes but i must prepare for another world feeling now that his end was near he made his last * you will find in my hat he said to a member of his staff a little confederate flag which a lady of columbia south carolina sent me * that i would wear it on my horse in battle and return it to her send it to her he gave then the name of the lady and added my * always worn in * promised to give to mrs * lee at * my * i leave to my son his horses and * were then given to his * papers directed to be sent to his wife a prayer was then offered by the minister at his * his lips moved as he repeated the words as the prayer ended he * i am going fast * am resigned gods will be done as the words escaped from his lips he * i was not at stuarts * when he died while * the rest to hold him in the saddle i had been shot through the shoulder and * hours afterward i lay at the house of a friend in richmond turning and * with fever in my * i heard a mournful * of * it was many days however before i knew that they were * for stuart when at last after more than a months * to my bed i rose and began to * * faint and weak but * great loss for the first time struck me in all its force where should i turn * * should i go jackson dead at * at yellow * i seemed to have lost my support to * and * in darkness without a guide these two * of battle had gone down in the storm and like the * of * i looked around me with * and * eyes asking * i was now to direct my steps and what work i should work in the coming years jackson * could * them they had loved and trusted * headquarters had been my home now when they disappeared i had no friends no home and an * sense of loss * upon me as a dark cloud * and * a * smiling and full of sunshine another * had come to me my father was dead the war had * the * of that * heart as it * the * of thousands and the * head of the house had * into the * from this double blow i scarcely had strength to rise for weeks i remained in a sort of * * and was only aroused from it by the necessity of looking after my family affairs as soon as i had strength to mount my horse i rode to * * a good aunt had come and * herself as the friend and * of my little * and with the arms of my young sister around me i wept for my father i remained at * * more than two months the long ride had made the wound in my shoulder * and i was again stretched upon a bed of illness from which at one time i thought i should not rise more than once i made a narrow escape from * parties of federal cavalry in the neighborhood and on one occasion an officer entered my chamber but left me * under the impression that i was too ill to live it was late in the month of august before i rose from my bed again and set out on my return in those three months and a * from the time i left * with * events had happened in virginia grants * and lees * had been * day and night hill and valley mountain and * and * * general grant had hastened forward from the wilderness only to find lee * him behind breastworks at * courthouse the confederate commander had taken up a defensive position on the line of the * and for more than two weeks grant threw his * against the works of his adversary in desperate * to break through on the 12th of may at daylight he nearly succeeded the horse * * was charged in the * of morning the * were surprised and * in the trenches the works carried the artillery captured and a large number of prisoners fell into the hands of the enemy the blow was heavy but general grant * little advantage from it lee * his troops formed a new line and repulsed every assault made on it throughout the entire day when night fell grant had not advanced further lees position was stronger than before and plainly * for many days grant was occupied in * and feeling his adversary at the end of a week the hope of breaking lees line was seen to be desperate then commenced the second great movement by the left flank toward richmond grant disappeared one morning and hastened toward * junction when he arrived lee was there in his front ready to receive him and the new position was stronger if any thing than that of * grant felt it abandoned the attempt to carry it at once and again moved on his * and * way by the left flank toward richmond crossing the * at * he made straight for the capital but reaching the * he found lee again awaiting him then the days and nights * as they had been * since the day when grant crossed the rapidan lee could not be driven and the federal movement by the left flank began again grant made for cold harbor and * his army to burst through the chickahominy and seize richmond the huge * began to move at daylight on the third of june half an hour afterward # of general grants forces were dead or wounded he was repulsed and driven back his whole loss from the moment of crossing the rapidan had been about # men that ended all hopes of * the lines of the chickahominy the federal commander gave up the attempt in despair and resumed his * march moving still by the left flank he hastened to cross james river and advance on petersburg but lee was again too rapid for him in the works south of the appomattox the gray infantry under the brave general wise * the enemy they repulsed every assault and grant sat down to lay * to richmond from the distance of thirty miles such had been the great campaign of the summer of 1864 in virginia lee had everywhere stood at bay and repulsed every attack he had also struck in return a great * blow in maryland at cold harbor early in june news had arrived that a federal column under * was advancing on lynchburg a force was sent to * * under the command of early that hard * crossed the mountains attacked his adversary drove him beyond the * and then returning on his steps hurried down the * valley toward the potomac driving every thing before him once at the potomac he hastened to cross into maryland once in maryland early advanced without loss of time upon washington at * he met and defeated general * pressed after him toward washington and reaching the * works advanced his lines to the assault but he had but a * after the long and * march his numbers were * * to storm the * of the capital grant had sent forward in haste two army corps to defend the city and early was compelled to retreat across the potomac to the * valley with the sole satisfaction of * that he had given the enemy a great * and had * the * flag in front of the * of washington i have not space to describe the cavalry movements of the summer hampton had succeeded stuart in command of all the cavalry and the country soon heard the ring of his heavy * in june sheridan was sent to capture * and * but hampton * and defeated him in a fierce action near * and in another at * pursued him to the white house hurried him on to james river and sheridan crossed that stream on * glad no doubt to get back to the blue infantry hampton crossed also * to * defeated the enemy at * church * their men and * they had been * with a * loss of more than # prisoners such were the events which had taken place during my * illness they came to me only in * * or by means of chance newspapers sent by my * at last however i rose from my sick * and * my aunt and sister who were to remain together at * * set out on my return stuarts staff were all scattered and * new positions i was one of them and i again asked myself more * than at first where shall i go the gentlemen of the red * at richmond would doubtless * me however and riding on steadily with a keen look out for * parties i at last reached the city on the next day i * my application in the war office to be assigned to duty a week afterward i had not heard from it * the red * were evidently not in the least bit of a * hat in hand i awaited their good pleasure richmond presented a singular spectacle in that summer of 1864 it was * the * city by our friends over the * and in truth there was something gloomy and tragic in its * the very atmosphere * it on every countenance you could read anxiety * the * effect of the terrible suffering and * of the * all things * to * the colors of the * picture hope long * had * the * hearts men were nervous anxious * up by the hot fever of war provisions of every description were sold at * * fathers of families could scarcely * the * food for their * and children the streets were * with poor * * sisters * mothers and pale daughters whose black * told the story of their loss to all eyes * * at the * agony * the heart soldiers pale and * from their * * by cannon * through the streets * dashed * and forward from the telegraph office to the war office the poor * rich scarcely * any better black hair

* they were better society was * from its * strange characters were thrown up the * had come to the top and bore itself bravely in the sunshine the whole social * seemed * and * from its base and in the midst of this * of * women * men * * * the * city day and night rolled the thunder of the cannon telling that grant and lee were still holding their high * at petersburg such was richmond at the end of summer in 1864 society was approaching one of those * when all things appear * * * toward some great * all * was * the * had come forth * * and * its * in the light of day * seemed coming and with it all the powers of darkness that spectacle was singular to a soldier * in camps and * now for some years to the * * of the field i looked on with astonishment the whole * seemed * characters

the acquaintance of the youthful * at the first glance i felt that i was in the presence of an original character his * on the * had just commenced he was seated * in an * surrounded by * from which he * * throwing the papers as soon as he had done so in a * upon the floor his black eyes long black hair * behind the ears and thin * cheeks were not agreeable but they made up a striking * the black

failed i * his figure and some scenes of that great * your own * reader * at the door of the * house on broad street nearly opposite the * church i was admitted by a negro servant sent up my name and was invited by mr * to * to his * on the second story i went up and found him leaning back in a high chair of black * in an apartment commanding a view * of james river and * on a table beside him were books and * furniture of the room was plain and simple he greeted me with great * * very * and offering me a cigar i had not seen him since his return from europe and looked at him with some curiosity he was as * as * eyes as black and * but his long black hair as straight as an indians and worn behind his ears when i first knew him was * now and his upper lip was covered by a black * his dress was simple and exceedingly * it was impossible not to see that the famous * was a gentleman as i had visited him * upon a matter of business i * it and then rose to take my departure but he urged me with * * not to * him he saw few persons he said i must stay and * with him i had business then i could attend to it and would do him the favor to return looking at my watch i found that it was nearly two * had informed me that he * at * not to * the reader with these details * to a very * memory i found myself two hours afterward seated at table with the editor of the * the table was of ancient and * * the dinner consisted of only two or three * but these were of the best * * * and served upon * of the most * description coffee * a great * not only the * * and other pieces of the service were of silver the * upon which they rested was of the same * * and * * we * at table throughout the entire afternoon my host having * every attempt which i made to * by taking my hat from my hand and * upon me another excellent * cigar * so extreme in one who bore the reputation of a * was at least something * as my host had * to my weak side by greatly * a slight literary * of mine he would be proud he assured me to have it thought that he had written it i yielded surrendered my hat * the cigar offered me and we went on talking i still recall that conversation the last but one which i ever had with this singular man unfortunately it does not * the narrative i now write and i would not like to record his * and * directed at the government he * it without mercy and his * upon the character of president davis were exceedingly bitter one of these was * for the grim * of the idea opening a volume of * complete works he had just * showed me a passage in one of the * * of the great * where king * on his * after * * upon his * * that having * all his enemies en * * he is ready to die a grim smile came to the face of the * as he showed me the passage that * mr davis exactly he said he * his enemies en * * i believe i will make an * and * the passage on * he * understand it that was * it not reader i raised my pen to draw a line through the incident but it can do no * now the solitary * spoke freely of himself and his * for the future with a few * from our talk on this point i will * my account of the interview you see i am here * to the pen he said and * i have that which * the * officers if the government takes a fancy to order * into the ranks smiling slightly as he spoke he showed me his right hand the fingers of which he could scarcely * i was wounded at cold harbor in june 1862 he added not much wounded either but sufficient to prevent me from * a sword or * it is a * i should like to be able to show an honorable * in this cause and i am sorry i left the army by this time i might have been a * a majorgeneral possibly i replied but the position of an editor is a powerful one do you think so dont you yes colonel but what good is the * doing what can all the papers in the confederacy effect besides i like to command men i love power i laughed i would * the * view of things i said why not take the good the gods provide as a soldier you would be in * your * say nothing of the * that might cut short your career and yet this life of the brain is wearing too but my health is all the better for it he said a friend was here to see me the other day and i startled him by the observation i shall live to eat the * that * the grass over your grave when he * my meaning i replied for two * come of a * race and have an * sign of * i never dream and my sleep is always sound and * do you believe in that * i said thoroughly he replied laughing i shall live long in spite of the * which would destroy me in an instant if the secret * i have could only accomplish their end without danger to themselves you do not really believe surely that you have such * not believe it i know it you have them colonel too how long do you think you would live if your enemies had their way with you perhaps you think you have no enemies who hate you enough to kill you you are greatly * man has his enemies i have them by the thousand and i have no doubt you too have them though they are probably not so numerous as mine but their * comes to nothing because to * it would bring them into trouble he replied neither your enemies or mine would run the risk of * us in open day but suppose they could kill us by simply * it i should drop down dead before your * you would fall a * in main street before you reached your home a gloomy view enough but i dare not deny it it would be useless colonel that is the way men are made for myself i * all of * nearly all he uttered the words with intense bitterness and for a moment remained silent this is gloomy talk he said and will not * you let us change the * when i am not * public * * of this wretched administration and the old man of the sea * upon the * * ought to try and * myself you find the * a heavy weight upon you it is a * around my neck why not throw it off if you find it * because i look to this journal as a father does to an only * my pet my pride and the support and honor of myself and my name in the future you are proud of it it has made me and it will do more for me * than it has ever done yet he paused and then went on with a glow in his * face every man has his * object in this world colonel mine is the success and glory of the * i intend to make of it what the london times is in england and the * great power which shall lay down the law control * * parties and direct events it has given me much trouble to * it but a * now from the * i expect to realize the great dream of my life the dream of your life what is * i may ask without * oh i make no secret of it and as a gentleman speaking to a gentleman can say what i could not in the society of * or common people my family is an old and honorable one in * by way of explanation only i beg you to note we are thus people of old * but my * of the family is * my object is to * it and you will perhaps * me to the * young * in * my * who * to * the family * and * up the lonely old * * is it you remember yes i said well i always * with that character he is * bad you say granted but he is * and * his object is noble i * with you the object is noble i am glad you think so colonel i see i speak to one who has the old virginia feeling you respect family who does not there are those who * to care * for it but it is because they are * yes was the * reply * very * ones i laughed at the * * for my own part i said i do not * to be * whether or not my father was a gentleman i bow as * to the * as if it were the * he came over with but still i am glad my father was a gentleman i hope no one will * with that you are mistaken they will hate you for it you are * i interrupted you i am glad the * came colonel for it gave you an opportunity of showing me that my views and your own are in * * on this subject i will proceed therefore without ceremony to tell you what i design doing some day i listened with attention it is always interesting to look into the * of a remarkable mans character this human being was * in an * filled with * and chance was about to give me an * into his secret thoughts he * a * in his fingers * a moment and said i am still * very young either for i will soon be * i know no young man who has better * than myself and few who have done so well i suppose i am worth now nearly # in good money i have more gold * than i know what to do with the * is very valuable property and is destined to be much more so i expect to live long and if i do i shall be rich when i am rich i shall buy the old family estate in * county and shall add to it all the land for miles around i shall * a house to my fancy and with all my * * in i shall teach these people what they never * to live like a gentleman the glow had * on the * face it was easy to see that the * had * to me the dream of his life your scheme is one i said which takes my fancy greatly but why do you intend to wall in your property to keep out those * called men ah i forgot you do not like those * without * i like some of them colonel but the majority are worse than my * * and frank yonder sometimes i think they are * * each other so i laughed there was something * in the grim * of this singular * what is your * man i said for doubtless you have such an * yes i like a man of * who does not * or * i like wigfall for his * and his magnificent courage it is the * thing there is no put on there he has native * * * it is no * on him to * it the * is in him and you cant shake him you would admit your men of * then into the * * in * i dont know he said * with my * a good * english books and * hate your yankee * * travel i think i could get through life without very great * i do not expect to be governor of virginia for ten years yet and smiling the * said let us change the subject what are people talking about i never ask what is the news is any thing said of * virginia that is a * idea whom have you seen * a * set i said and i gave him an account of my dinner at mr * what a little * he said i think i will run a * through that * and * him he would make a fine * served up la * * you have read * * yonder it is a * affair and taking up the * bound volume which must have cost him a considerable * he quietly * it out of the window as he did so the * devil appeared at the door holding proof in his hand you see i am never safe from * colonel this * * * me at the * i rose and put on my hat come and see me again soon if it * your * he said i am going to write an * and i think i will serve up your host * do not use his name be * he will be the * only and * me to the door mr * * a * bow upon me which i returned

had made a speech of * * in congress on the condition of the country and i had listened * at the brave voice which rang out its * * well amid the storm i was now going to call on the * to express my admiration of his * appeal and * upon the * * of the hour i found him in a mansion not far from the splendid residence of mr * here he occupied * or rather a single * in 1864 my dear reader that was a very common * of living like others judge conway was too poor to occupy a whole * too poor to board he had a single apartment containing a few * and a bed was waited on by a maid and i think prepared his own * which were plain to * he met me at the door of his bare and * apartment extending his hand with the * and stately courtesy of the ancient * his figure was small slight and bent by age his face thin and pale his hair nearly white and falling in long * upon his shoulders under the gray * * keen * but * eyes as i pressed the hand of my host and looked around the poor apartment i could not * from a sentiment of profound bitterness two days before i had * at the table of a * * who * * * * wore fine * and * the * officers * in * and * and now here before me was a gentleman of ancient * whose * had been famous who had himself played a great part in the history of the * this gentleman was poor lived in * had * a * he had been * and was still the * of great * but the bare land was all that was left him for support he had been surrounded with * but had * all to the cause he had had two gallant sons but they had fallen at the first * crossed * were above his poor bare * from the splendid table of the * * i had come to the * apartment of this great * and * gentleman oh * i * it is your * not the * of * that suit this * the old * pointed with all the grace of a * to a bare * and received my * upon his speech with * * i am glad that my views are * by your good opinion colonel he said and that you * of the tone of them i am naturally given to * habit * from my friend the late mr randolph but the country wants * and yet not to * is so hard my dear sir very hard think of the army * soldiers * * in ruin and entire destruction threatening us the old * was silent a moment afterward he raised his head and with his thin finger pointed to the crossed * above his * i try to bear and * since i lost my poor boys he said they died for their * ought to live for it and do what i can in my * * my bitterness and try to utter words of good cheer but we are * gloomy * let us come to more cheerful matters i am in very good spirits today my daughters have come to make me a visit and the old face * with smiles its expression was quite charming i see you do not appreciate that great * my dear colonel he added smiling you are yet * though i * to hear you are soon to be united to

with papers and * * a cigar the * of which indicated its excellent * i enjoyed the * of mr * in spite of the difference of our * and positions he had been the friend of my father and in my turn did me the honor to * his friendship upon me on this evening i was seized with the fancy to visit * passing through the grounds of the capitol where the * washington and his great companions looked silently out into the moonlight reached the small house followed the path through the * and opening the door in the rear found myself suddenly * in a cloud of cigar smoke through which * the * figure of mr * he was seated as usual in his large * by the table covered with papers and a small bell near his hand seemed placed there for the * of * an * without the trouble of rising near the bell lay a * of * *

road we are gone mr * * his cigar with extreme * as he spoke but one thing remains i said what is that lee will retreat from virginia mr * shook his head he will not why not he will be prevented from doing so under any circumstances until too late at least and the result * he said to me the other day when he came to see me here for myself i intend to die sword in hand i could not * from a sentiment of profound gloom as i listened to these * * it seemed * that they could be well * but i had more than once had an opportunity to remark the extraordinary * of the remarkable man with whom i * you draw a black picture of the future i said and the south seems moving to and fro on the * of a * no * could be more just and what will be the result of the war that is easy to reply to political

calling out * come in the door opened and a stranger * into the apartment he was * in a blue federal uniform * by a brown * * his face was almost covered by a red * his lips by a * of the same color and his eyes disappeared behind huge green * come in repeated mr * who seemed to recognize the * what news the * glanced quickly at me speak before him said mr * he is a friend i am very well * with colonel surry said the other smiling and have the honor to number him i hope among my own friends with which words the * quietly removed his red * took off his green * and i saw before me no less a * than mr nighthawk nothing was more * in this singular man than these sudden * at places and times when you least expected him i had parted with him in * on the night when he deserted from the enemy and rode into our lines and he was then the secret agent of general stuart now he * in the city of richmond with an excellent * it was evident between himself and mr * our * was cordial and indeed i never had * nighthawk among * * general stuart assured me one day that he * refused all * and his profound almost * devotion to mohun had deeply impressed me love of country and * care of the young * whose past life was as * as his own seemed the * * of nighthawk and he always presented himself to me rather in the light of a political * than as a spy his first words now indicated that he was a secret agent of the government he seemed to have been everywhere and gained * to everybody and once more as in june 1863 when he appeared at stuarts headquarters near * he * me by the * and extent of his information political and military * of the highest importance and calling for * action on the part of the government were * by nighthawk in his calm and * voice he gave us an account of a long interview which he had had at city point with general grant and wound up as usual by * an * * movement of the enemy which * took place as he announced mr * listened with close attention asking few questions when nighthawk had made his report the * looked at his watch said * * * late and added aloud come back at ten tomorrow morning my friend your information is * interesting and important nighthawk rose and i did * * the * request of mr * to * my visit he held the door open with great * and said smiling i need not say my dear colonel that the views i have expressed this evening are * the present at least * i replied with a bow and a smile * you are at liberty to repeat them if you wish only i beg you will * them to mr * an unknown * if you write a book and put me in it send me a * * a moment afterward i was * my way through the * thinking of the curious * i had left at the gate nighthawk awaited me and i scarcely recognized him he had resumed his red * and green * i am glad to see you again colonel he said * i heard that you were in the city and called at your * but found you absent you wished to see me particularly then nighthawk yes and tonight colonel ah i know you are a friend of general * a very * friend well i think we will be able to do him a very great service by * to a little matter in which he is interested colonel are you * and willing to accompany me i looked * at nighthawk he was evidently very much in earnest i am entirely * and perfectly willing to accompany you i said but where nighthawk smiled you know i am a * person colonel both by character and * i fear the habit is growing on me in spite of every * i make i * i will end by burning my coat for fear it will tell some of my * well i said with a smile keep your secret then and lead the way i am ready to go far to * mohun in any thing i thank you colonel from my heart you have only to follow me and nighthawk set out at a rapid * through the grounds of the capitol toward the lower part of the city there was something as singular about the walk of my companion as about his appearance he went at a great * but his progress was entirely * you would have said that he was * along upon * wings in an * short time we had reached a street below the capitol and my companion who had walked straight on without turning his head to the right or the left all at once paused before a tall and * house which would have appeared completely * except for a bright red light which shone through a * opening in the door at this door nighthawk gave a single * the glass * the * space * back and a face * my companion uttered two words and the door opened giving * to a * which we * the * having already disappeared at the head of the * was a door which nighthawk opened and we found ourselves in an apartment where a dozen persons were playing * upon these nighthawk threw a rapid * one whom he appeared to be * was evidently not among the * another moment he returned through the door i following and we * a second flight of * at the top of which was a second door here another * * the way but my companion again uttered some low * door opened a * * apartment with a * of * and every * presented itself before us and in the midst of a dozen * who were playing * i * * mr * mr * and colonel * for some moments i stood watching the spectacle and it very * * my experience before me i saw prominent * officers of high rank * of government holding * positions all * with an * that * to fury one gentleman in * of the * * in his hand a huge * of confederate notes of the * of # and # and this worthy * twice the pretty little amount of # upon a * and each time lost the play so absorbed the soldiers * and * that our presence was * my friend mr * did not turn his head mr * mr * and colonel * were red in the face and * after that evening i knew where some of the public money went as i was looking at the strange scene of reckless excitement one of the * a * individual with black * rich dark * gold * and wearing a fine suit of * and looked toward us nighthawk was already * at him and suddenly i saw their * cross like * * they had evidently recognized each other and going up to the gentleman of the * nighthawk said a few words in a low voice which i did not * with pleasure my dear friend said the * gentleman but you are sure you are not provided with a * of general * can you believe such a thing returned nighthawk * i thought it possible you might have one waiting below but if you give me your word nighthawk and without further * the worthy followed nighthawk and myself down the * as we approached the * door the * * opened it we issued forth into the street and the * gentleman * a keen look upon me in the clear moonlight said i believe we have had the pleasure of meeting before colonel i am ashamed to say i do not remember where sir i said my memory is better colonel we met last may in a house in the wilderness near chancellorsville is it possible that you are swartz very much at your service it is wonderful what a difference is made by a * and * as he spoke he * removed his black * and the gold * in the man with gray hair small eyes and double * i recognized the spy of the wilderness * his * and * mr swartz smiled in a * manner and said may i ask to what i am * for this visit nighthawk replied even more * i wish to have a conversation with you my dear swartz before * you ah you intend to arrest me unless you make it * how by * the paper which we spoke of in the wilderness said nighthawk * swartz shook his head that is not in my power my friend i did not bring it with me will you think me very * if i say i do not believe you my dear swartz swartz smiled well that would be speaking without ceremony my * i assure you i am unable to do as you desire * you repeat that curious statement my dear swartz well * me by * me to the * you arrest me * as a spy why not it is impossible nighthawk you resist i might do so and opening his coat mr swartz exhibited a * and * i show you these little * said he laughing * to let you see my friend that i might * your * you know i am not * in * them on occasion but i make a difference you are not a common * or * * are a friend and comrade and i am going to prove that i appreciate your feelings and respect your wishes nighthawk fixed his eyes on the * and listened you are a friend of general * said mr swartz with * good * you wish to secure a certain * in which he is interested you fancy i have that * here in the city of richmond and your object very naturally is to force me to surrender it well i do not object to doing * a consideration i fully intend to * it when my terms are accepted i would have stated them to you in the wilderness but you were unable to meet * to general mohun but his * defeated every thing you meet me now and without discussion demand the paper i reply that i have not brought it with me but three days from this time will meet you at a spot agreed on with the * for which you will return * consideration nighthawk shook his head unfortunately my dear swartz experience tells me that the present is always the best time for * a bird in the hand is worth two in the * mr swartz smiled * and i am the bird in your hand something like it i am a spy dont use hard names my friend by no means my dear nighthawk and if i have hurt your feelings i deeply regret it but i am speaking to the point you regard me as a federal spy * in * * my * and are going to arrest me and search my * for that paper the necessity is painful said nighthawk it is useless my friend i will try it swartz smiled and drew a paper from his pocket which he * you are then determined to arrest your old comrade nighthawk yes my dear swartz as a spy exactly in spite of this and mr swartz held out the paper do me the favor to read this colonel and then * me by returning it i took the paper and easily read it by moonlight it contained the following words the * is employed on secret service by the confederate government and will not be * the paper was * by a * of high position in the government and was * with the * of the department over which he * there could be no doubt of the * of the paper the worthy mr swartz * up before me in the * and unexpected light of a confederate * i read the paper aloud to nighthawk and pointed to the official * and * nighthawk uttered a * and his * sank upon his breast that spectacle seemed to * the sympathy of his friend there my dear nighthawk said mr swartz in a feeling tone dont take the blow too much to heart i have * you this game and your hands are tied at present but i * that i will meet you and * that paper when * nighthawk in three days from this time where at the house of our friend * near * neck in * on your word on the word of swartz that is enough my dear swartz i will be at * when we will come to terms and now pardon this visit which has put you to so much * i was merely * my dear friend when i spoke of * you arrest you nothing could * me to think of so * a * and now good night my dear friend i will return with you colonel with which words nighthawk * his friend and we returned toward the upper part of the city such were the scenes of a night in the summer of 1864 on the next morning a piece of good fortune * me in spite of continued visits to the * and an amount of * which must have been exceedingly * to the gentlemen of the red * i found myself at the end of august apparently no nearer to an * to duty than at first it really seemed that the confederate states had no need of my services that the privilege of * military duty in behalf of the government was one * guarded and not to be * * upon any one i was in despair and was * the * of * my empty commission and * in the cavalry as a private soldier when the * * * to * me from all my * appeared in the person of colonel p of army headquarters this accomplished soldier and gentleman met me as i was coming out of the * on the morning after the visit to mr * looking i suppose like some * of the * of the * countenance and stopped to * the cause of my * i informed him of the whole affair and he laughed * you have set about your affairs my dear colonel in a manner entirely wrong he said you should have gone to some general discovered that your grandmother and his own were third cousins expressed your admiration of his * * the * with whom he was * written * to the papers about him and then one morning said by the by general you are * to another staff officer the result would have been a * letter to the war department * your * would have * your * would have been torn from the horrors of richmond and once more enjoyed the great privilege of being shot at i * the * laugh alas i said i have no genius for all that i never yet could * the * of the knee that * might follow * and i suppose i shall be compelled to * and enter the ranks why not better men are there carrying * or * or * the * still you gained your rank by your * i am going to make you an offer which will enable you to * it come and be my * * officer is required to * the cavalry and horse artillery which is so distant often that i have no time to visit them a thousand thanks colonel you could not offer me a more pleasant duty you will have to ride a great deal but will have a great deal of freedom if you consent to my proposition i will have the matter arranged at once and will request you to make a * of * to general * army near winchester he looked at me laughing the * * charming place he added and you are certain to be very tired when you reach the vicinity of * if you find it * to stop * for a day or * my * to colonel * and any of the family you find present with which words he laughed again shook me by the hand and then his tall form disappeared in the * of the war office on the next day i found my * awaiting me i was appointed * * of the cavalry and horse artillery of the army of northern virginia tremendous title that evening i went by * to petersburg to visit colonel p and receive his instructions returning the same night the next day set out on horseback for the valley of the * by way of orange * cross roads and * gap of this journey it is * for me to speak in the present volume some curious * occurred to me in the valley near * and i made the acquaintance of st * * of * one of the * and * gentlemen i have ever known the * * to and some events in the strange history of my friend captain * are * in a separate * to which i have given the * title * to * or days and nights on the banks of the * i remained in the valley from the first to the * of september when i set out on my return to petersburg little thinking that on the very next day general early would be attacked on the * driven from winchester and forced to retreat up the valley in spite of fighting which was never * i had received some rough * in a cavalry combat near the old chapel beyond * and my ride back was * but at last i reached richmond and made preparations to set out at once for the army on the evening before my departure i went to visit the grave of stuart at * on the beautiful hill above the * west of the city as i approached the lonely spot where the great * was lying beside his little * of whom he had often spoken to me with tears a thousand memories * at the door of my heart with head bent down and * resting on my breast i drew near the * * over which waved the autumn * * with yellow and * in these few moments all the splendid career of stuart passed before me as on that day when i rode with him toward the fatal field of yellow tavern i remembered all his hard * his glorious * his * over such * as * his claim to a * from the * * and * him with the most famous leaders of cavalry in all history i recalled the courage the joy the gay laughter of the great * blue eyes that flashed * * voice singing the merry songs i remembered all the occasions when he had led his men in the * he had wept for jackson bowed his head above the cold face of * he had met the * * * from nothing in his path fallen to save the virginia capital and died * gods will be * remembered all that and with something in my throat that seemed * me drew near the quiet * beneath which rested such a career and so much glory the birds were * and singing the * waving * raised my * suddenly i became aware that a solitary * was * over the grave he was an officer in gray uniform he held a flower in his hand which he dropped upon the grave * a low * as he did so at the same moment he turned round and i recognized the great * colonel * * hours after i had passed over the same number of miles and found myself at the staff headquarters on the left bank of the appomattox above petersburg i had soon * my tent with the assistance of a servant had * a * of * * to protect it from the * * of the coming winter and a few days afterwards was surrounded with many * of comfort my tent had been * at one end rose an excellent * * of * * * on two * * a spring bed i had secured a * * chair and my saddle and * were disposed upon a rough * near a black * containing my small * of * and the pine table and desk holding official papers having * this * the * i settled down for a long * it was not a great while before i * myself on the good fortune which had provided me with that warm * more than once however i * something like a sentiment of shame when in the dark and * nights with the * * on my tent i sat by my warm fire and heard the * of the sharpshooters along the lines beyond petersburg what right had i to be there by that * fire in my warm tent when my * of them my * yonder fighting along the * hills what had i done to * that comfort and * from all pain i was * or reading by my * * were keeping back the enemy and perhaps falling and dying in the darkness i was * in my chair * into the * and going back in memory to the fond scenes of home so clearly that i laughed the hearts laugh and was happy and they they too were thinking of home * their * and children to * down the next moment * with cold or * and fall with * blood as the * * them why should i be thus * by a good * i often asked myself that question and i could not answer it i could only * i did not * here to get out of the way of the * yonder are my * guard and keep the brave soldiers of this army and now worthy reader having given you some idea of the manner in which the more fortunate ones * near petersburg in 1864 i am going to drop the subject of army headquarters and my * there jackson and stuart are dead and have become figures of history i have drawn them as well as i * dare not attempt to do the same with the great commanderinchief he is alive may he live * * him i pass on so if i speak of general lee it will be of the individual in his official character what he * he will have uttered in the hearing of many with these words of * i * the * of my history october 1864 had come the situation may be described in a few words grant had drawn his lines from a point in charles city on the left bank of james river across that stream and across the appomattox around petersburg to the * * road where he threatened the * railroad lees line of communication with the south and west fort harrison had just been taken grant was gradually * in his * along the immense line extending across the two * past the scene of the famous * * to the vicinity of the * a distance of nearly forty miles one * * and thunder went up day and night grant was * * carrying out his * and the military view apart never was spectacle more * than that presented in these * the long lines of works were * with the smoke of battle the * of cannon * the * * shells rose described their fiery * and * in the trenches and these were * as they rose and fell by the * of * the roar of artillery the * cheers of the blue and gray people who never seemed weary of fighting * and * their * to each other at night the spectacle was * the * were like * of * * down upon their * the * * at each * shell burst in * * shining for a moment then * and yonder object like a * eye shining * through the * is that it is a lamp my dear reader with a * * and on this * is written for the information of the * while yet the lamp * out to burn the * rebel may return lees lines * grants following the blue * across the * around petersburg toward the * railroad beyond the right of the confederate infantry stretched the cavalry which consisted of the divisions of * hampton and * * former commanding fitz lee with his division was in the valley such reader was the situation when i joined the army the great fifth act of the tragic * was approaching three days after my arrival i mounted my horse crossed the appomattox followed the * road struck * at the * road and soon found myself in the heart of the * pine woods of that singular country * my official duty was to * and report the condition of the cavalry and horse artillery of the army at the beginning and middle of each month and now first * the reader that i performed my duty in all weather and amid every difficulty i will drop the official * of my history and proceed to matters rather more * on the day after my departure from petersburg i had made my * and was returning i had been received by my old friends of the cavalry with every mark of cordial regard general hampton general lee and the various officers and men whom i had known as a * of general stuart seemed to welcome the sight of a face which perhaps * them of their dead leader and i had pressed all these warm hands and received these friendly * not without * i too was carried back to the past i saw * and davenant but not * was absent visiting his * line * was the same stately * grave and friendly voice greeted me * as in old days and * davenant now a major commanding a * of horse artillery shook hands with me as * and * as * even more sad how had his suit * were things more * i asked him these questions with a laugh * for my * he assured me sadly that it was not in the least an * but that he had not seen the person to whom i * for many months and * a * which would have become a girl this young * of the horse * such he always proved himself in a * to change the subject soon afterward i took my departure turned my horses head toward petersburg and set out at a round * between the walls of pine it was * when i reached the * of the military road and tired and hungry i was * * the long ride still before me when rapid * behind me attracted my attention and turning my head i recognized the bold figure of mohun he was mounted on a fine animal and came at full speed in a moment he had caught up recognized and we exchanged a warm grasp of the hand i am delighted to see you surry i thought you had deserted us old fellow the sight of you is a * and the sight of you my dear mohun you look * indeed mohun had never presented a better appearance with his dark eyes his * and * cheeks his * * lips which parting with a smile showed white and regular teeth he was the picture of a gallant soldier all his old melancholy and * bitterness gone as * is swept away by the morning sunshine you are * * mohun where are you going and what has happened to you * begin to understand and * * i said five forks is not far from here is it mohun colored but the next moment burst into laughter you are right old friend it is impossible to * any thing from you and a friend of yours is * you are going to see yes my dear surry was his reply in a voice of sudden * you are not mistaken and you see i am like all the rest of the world when we first met on the rapidan i was a * i * them all for i had had reason that was my state of mind when a very beautiful and noble girl whom you have seen crossed my path events threw us * the wound i received at * caught me as i was falling on that * several times afterward i saw and * with her finding her proud * * to admiration but as honest and true as * still our relations did not proceed beyond friendship and when i told you one day in the wilderness that i was not her * i spoke the truth i am not exactly able to say as much * to finish my account of myself i came here to * on the right of the army and a week or two after my arrival the enemy made a cavalry * toward the * railroad i followed and came up with them as they were * a house not far from five forks well i charged and drove them into the * who should make her appearance at the door but miss conway whom i had last seen in culpeper as you know her father * * is now at * after following the enemy back to their own lines * them up with * and * i came back to * the extent of their * at five forks such is the simple explanation of the present situation my dear friend miss virginia cordially invited me to come whenever i could do so and although miss georgia was less * fact said nothing on the * was not cast down thereby i returned have been often since * all mohun laughed the hearts laugh you have heard that have you not reader now tell me about yourself he added and on the way to five forks i see you are tired and hungry come they have the * * yonder and are the soul of * the offer was * why not accept it my * * exactly three * at the end of that time i was riding beside mohun in the direction of five forks which we reached just as i * my account of myself since mohun and i had parted in the wilderness five forks was an old mansion not far from the place of the same name now become * it was a building of large * the grounds were * and had been * the house had evidently been the home of a long line of gentlemen whose * * by those of their fair * * the walls of the great drawingroom between the lofty windows in the hall stood a tall * filled with law books and * of * from the * hung pictures of * and old * such was the * which the federal cavalry had visited leaving as always their * in broken furniture * * and * grounds i shall not pause to describe my brief visit to this * house the young ladies had returned from richmond some time before * by the * * that faithful old * * and as a result of the * which i had spent with them and their father i had the honor to be received in the character of an old friend ten minutes after my arrival i saw that mohun was * in love with miss georgia and i thought i * as clearly that she returned his affection their * * * meeting and mohun followed every movement of the * girl with those long fixed * which leave nothing in doubt the * sister miss virginia received me with charming * but a secret melancholy * down the * * the blue eyes were sad the very smiles on the * lips were sad all was plain here too at a single glance the pure girl had given her heart to the brave * davenant and some * * of her father toward the young officer forced them apart what was the * of that * why had judge conway so * torn his daughter away from davenant at the ball in * why had that shadow passed over the old * brow when i uttered the name of the young man in richmond i asked myself these questions * decided in my mind that i should probably never know i was mistaken i was going to know before midnight after an excellent supper over which miss georgia * with stately * she too had changed in as marked a degree as * rose declared i must return to petersburg and bade the young ladies who cordially pressed me to remain * mohun declared that he would remain an hour * having promised a visit soon at his camp on the * i mounted my horse and set out through the darkness for petersburg following the white oak road i passed * run at * mill and went on over the * road * upon the scene i had just left all at once my horse placed his foot upon a sharp * in the road * nearly fell and when i touched him with the * i found that he * * * i * his foot the sharp point had entered it and it was * * the accident was * * to ride on i found the hurt worse than i had expected my gray * on as if the * were broken i dismounted once more led him slowly by the * and continued my way on foot a quarter of a mile farther the animal was in such agony that i looked around for some light by which to examine the hurt more fully on the right a * was seen through the trees i made straight toward it through the woods and soon found myself near a group of * one of which was * up whose headquarters are these i asked of a man on post near mine my dear colonel said a voice in the darkness near my * yonder is * and * me to recognize you with which words the figure advanced into the light and i recognized the tall and stately form of general davenant he gave me his hand cordially and i explained my * you are unfortunate but fortunate too said davenant as i have a man among my * who knows all about horses i will

plain desk and two * on the other a rough * of pine * filled with * and spread with * upon the * a boy of about * was sound asleep the light * * * in * over the * young face at a glance i recognized the youth who had entered the ranks at gettysburg taken part in picketts charge and been borne out through the smoke wounded and * in the arms of his father the young * had evidently recovered and was as * as before his little * * was as * his face as smiling as on that evening near paris an hour afterward general davenant and myself were * like old friends we were by no means strangers as i had * been thrown with him in the army and my * with will doubtless * me to the brave soldiers regard an accident now seemed about to make us still better * the * had reported that it would be impossible to proceed farther with my horse that night and i had accepted the invitation of general davenant to remain with him until morning my brigade is holding the right of the army colonel he had said we have just moved to this position and have not had time to become very comfortable but i can offer you a * supper and a * after it with a warm welcome i assure you i declined the supper but accepted the bed and seated opposite the * old * in his gray uniform had begun to * something about the stately general of infantry drew me * toward him his bearing was lofty and not without a * of * but under all was an exquisite * and courtesy which made his society quite charming at some words of mine however in reference to my visit on this day to his son a decided expression of gloom had * the smiles of the old soldier yes colonel he said with something like a sigh * has lost his good spirits and has been much * for more than a year you are his * share his * doubtless know the * of this * i do general a very common cause of trouble to young * young lady a young lady repeated general davenant in the same gloomy tone he has committed the * of falling in love as the * is * conway he paused before the words miss conway and uttered them with evident * they issued from his lips indeed with a * of * and he seemed glad to get * of them if i may so express myself i can talk of this affair with you colonel he added * for will has told me of your regard for him i bowed and said you are not wrong in * that i am one of your sons best friends general i was long in the cavalry with * is no more heroic soldier in the * it has given me * sorrow to see him * under such melancholy general davenant with his hand * his brow listened in silence i have not * the * of this * i * would have been * i know will would tell me i * it however and i have visited the young lady at her house tonight i will certainly use my * * to remove all * general davenant suddenly rose erect his eye was * i beg you will not colonel he exclaimed the * between himself * * never be removed i looked at the * flushed face with * wonder and replied you * me general are there any such * in life there are i made no reply there are colonel repeated the now fiery old soldier judge conway has been * of a * wrong to me no son of mine shall ever form an * with his family i looked up with deep astonishment this is a very great surprise to me my dear general i said i thought from many things that it was judge conway who opposed this * and from the belief that you had done him some great wrong general davenant had taken his seat again after his * once more his forehead was covered with his hand for some moments he * a silence so profound that nothing * the night but the long * of the sleeping boy and the * tramp of the * then all at once the general raised his head his expression was no longer * was * sad i have been * colonel he said * and in these few minutes have come to a somewhat singular determination what is that general to tell you why my son can never marry the daughter of judge conway general davenant leaned his * on the desk rested his forehead in his hand and said in a deep * voice my story need not be a long one colonel those who * gay * and * * * in * * is charming to them at such * go back to the past with a smile on the lips * every little * every color of the bright picture my own narrative will be brief because it is a gloomy one it is far from pleasant to return to the scenes i * to describe i only do so to * a * which seems to * to my family and myself to show you that in spite of judge conway i * your good opinion * i do not * any pleasure to myself in * these events alas one of the * things to a proud * i am * to even seem to defend his good name from * * * his * as he spoke the old soldier looked * into the * before us in a moment he went on i was born in the county of * colonel where my family had lived from the time of the first * of virginia my father was a large * and his most * friend was mr conway the father of the present judge the family friendship was * by the young people of the two * my two most * friends were george and william conway one is dead the other is judge william conway member of congress we had played together as children been companions at school when our fathers died and we in turn became the representatives of the two families our friendship became even more close i was half my time at five * paid long visits to me at the * * together went to * together * wine together and were * george was especially my favorite he was the soul of * everybody loved him and i entertained for him the most tender friendship his brother william was equally * but did not * you as * although a person of the highest sense of honor and * * for * of the first order he was * bitter and when once aroused allowed nothing to * him at such moments his best friends * him for he was dangerous he * no opposition his * was like a * fire and a friendship which he had formed with that gentleman of splendid powers but * * john randolph of * served still more to * him in the * of the natural * of his * more than once i have seen him almost * at the mouth as he * some political adversary from the * and when one of these * of * seized him he became as * as a wild animal you can scarcely realize that now sorrow has * him trouble has * him i have nothing to say against the judge william conway of today he is a * * a gentleman of * courtesy and * of character but as a young man he was a * and i think the fire is still * beneath the gray * of the man of * such were george and william conway when i knew them as young * one * * the soul of kindness and * the other proud honorable but subject to * of * * which made all avoid him when the * was upon him from this * description you will understand why george was a greater favorite with me than his brother our friendship was indeed as close and tender as possible and we passed our majority and approached the age of twentyfive without ever having had a moments * of our * then all at once there appeared upon the stage that cause of so much happiness * joy grief to * woman to make a long story short george conway and myself were so unfortunate as to become attached to the same young lady and very soon this sentiment * both on his part and on my own to a wild and * * the young * is * to mention her * a person of rare beauty and mistress of all the * which bring young men to the feet of women she used these * too for nothing delighted her so much as to * admiration and * love * the effect which her grace and * had produced upon myself and george she made every * to * our * first one then the other and in the end succeeded in breaking those close * of friendship which had bound us from the time when we had played together as children that is a sad * colonel but it is the truth the bright eyes and smiles of a girl had * a * friendship the mere love of admiration in the heart of a young girl had interrupted the affection of * george and myself cold and * toward each other soon things became still worse from friends we had become mere * * we became strangers and finally * * whispered * * the flames if the young lady smiled on me at a party where george was present the good people around us looked at him with * meaning if she smiled on george their eyes were turned toward me and they * and whispered that is all * it not an old story which every country neighborhood knows you laugh perhaps at hearing it told of a and * you do not laugh when you are one of the * well not to * my history * an open * and * at last arose between myself and poor george we had been * on to hate each other and * escaped having an affair * to the pistol as the * it never came to that however i saw ere long that the young lady had made up her mind george was in every way a more * and * person than myself and after drawing me on * me and * me to offer her my hand she turned her back on me and married george such was the result of the campaign george had * i am obliged to say that i * him cordially i should never have done so from the simple fact of his success i am not so * as that my dear colonel bitter as was my disappointment i could have bowed to the * the young * offered my hand to dear george but there were our friends the * and * they were * in their * the whole affair under their personal * and * a hundred * to * and * me you would have said that they were bloody * * bent on trouble that their * was to * * me and cause * george had laughed at me they said never had had a moments doubt of the young * * had often * about me and expressed his pity for my * * had even * himself and the young lady by * my * and raising a laugh at my * these reports were * and * repeated for my information i was * and * and driven nearly mad by * a * nearly resulted but that last step was not taken i simply made my bow to the happy pair left them without a word and returned home determined to drop the whole * none the less * and * from that moment george and myself rarely met and never as friends i had been brought to hate * knew the * although he was innocent of all wrong to me as i know today made no effort to win my regard again he was as proud as * said * our * here separated forever such is the necessary introduction colonel said general davenant to the events which i * to * more than twenty years had passed continued general davenant when that old * which had been aroused in me toward george conway produced bitter * i was to be taught by a terrible experience that * is a deadly sin that god * it more severely than all other * for it is the * which * the whole heart to bitterness i had * * no effort to * * it like a * in the * of my breast and now god * as a * that the * should turn and * me to go back for a moment however george had * year afterward i had * him my wife was an angel upon * is an angel in heaven * in comparison with the deep affection which i felt for her the * fancy for the young lady whom my * had married appeared the * * william conway had also married and he and george with their * were living at five forks william was judge of the * * the * their affection for each other at this period of their * * was said to * that of their youth was said to i say colonel for i never saw either of them all * between the pines and five forks had ceased twenty years before and george and william conway were as much strangers to me as if we lived in opposite quarters of the * for time had not * rather * * cordial of the past on the contrary the * had become * * * us had grown * when i met either of the brothers we exchanged no * without looking at each * the family * between the * and the * was not even * to it had become an old story and lost its interest such was the condition of * the * which i occupied toward the two * the event which i am about to * took place the event in question was tragic and terrible it came without warning to * the entire * country one night on his return from the county seat * he was said to have gone upon some matter of business george conway was * and his body concealed in some * by the * the body was not discovered until the morning * the murder his * horse was then seen standing at the door of the * at five forks and in great terror judge conway set out rapidly to look for his brother who was supposed to have met with some accident two or three * whom he * to meet joined in the search the body was discovered and on examination revealed a deep * in the region of the heart apparently * by a * or a * the blow had evidently been * other hurt was visible george conway seemed to have been * by some unknown person and * on his return from the courthouse it was impossible to * the * of the crime or form any idea of his * upon the person of the * man a large * of money which he had received that day was discovered he had not been * thus by one * to rob him and his peaceful and * character * the * that he had aroused such * as could have led to the bloody * the whole affair was a profound * * could be discovered to the * or the * of the * the body was borne to five forks where it was laid in state to * * on the next day judge conway it was said had nearly lost his reason at this sudden and terrible blow he had loved his brother with extraordinary affection and the event struck him like a * his * of grief was succeeded by rage he fell into one of his * with flushed face * eyes and mouth * with a * of fury he mounted his horse went at full speed to the courthouse made * of everybody who had seen his brother asked with whom he had last been seen and left no stone * to * out the author of the crime meanwhile the whole county was * with * eyes the extraordinary event who could have * the act who could have * and * a man so * popular who was safe if such a state of things could * in a peaceful * a good citizen could not ride to see a * or to the county seat without danger of being * grief * horror were the * * some one must be discovered upon whom to lay the crime and that some one was the individual before you colonel let me continue i beg continued general davenant * your look of astonishment is quite natural you feel the * of a gentleman at my words but allow me to go on with my narrative poor george conway was buried on the day after the discovery of his body and an immense * accompanied him to his grave the funeral * was a mile long for the * attached to the event had drawn people from far and near and when the body reached the * the crowd nearly filled the small * i was present in my carriage with my wife and my son charles yonder then a child in arms you will understand colonel that i had not the heart to be absent i had long ceased to feel a sentiment of any great regard for the * but at the intelligence of * sudden death all my old friendship had * old kindly feeling came back pity * all * i thought of his former love for me and i determined to do all that remained in my power to show my * his funeral among those who * him well the body was borne to the grave the service read and the remains of the unfortunate gentleman * in their last * then the * * on the coffin the service ended and george conway had passed away from all eyes i looked at his poor wife and brother with tears in my eyes all my * was * memory went back to the old scenes at that instant i could have reached out my arms and drawn the * brother to my heart * my tears with his own all at once however i looked at judge conway with astonishment i had expected to see him * with * as he now raised his head and turned in the direction of the spot where i was standing i saw that his features were * with * his cheeks were crimson his teeth * his eyes * with blood suddenly these * eyes met my * cheeks a moment before so red grew * * it is you who * my brother he threw himself upon me with the fury of a wild animal and his fingers were nearly buried in my throat the assault was so sudden and terrible that i * back and nearly fell over the grave then * my * i caught judge conway by the throat in turn * him from me and stood * him pale * my throat * resolved if he attacked me again to put him to death with the first * upon which i could lay my hand he was meanwhile * in the hands of his friends who by main force held him back let me go he * * at the mouth with * man * my brother i will take the law into my own hands he shall not leave this spot alive he * to come here in the presence of the dead body of george * he is his * these words were rather * than uttered the * seemed to have lost his reason from pure * of rage if his friends had not * him by main force he would have thrown himself upon me a second time when one of us would have lost his life colonel for i was now as * * as himself that i should be thus * * with the * crime that the * of the old and honorable house of the * should be thus * * his person * his good name torn from * he should be * thus in the presence of all as a * and * you are * sir i at length said * to * my * your grief has * your brain i can pardon much in you today sir but * how you again attempt to * me hear him was the * and furious reply of judge conway and reaching out his thin fingers a habit he had caught from mr * pointed at me where i stood hear him he * * he is * he is * and yet he * my brother whom he has * for twenty * * him like an * and * him there is the proof and drawing from his pocket a * covered with * blood he threw it upon the grave before all eyes good god it was my own at the sight of that terrible object continued general davenant i * back and nearly fell i could not believe my * thought of * the * of the fearful * could only gaze at it with a wild horror * over me and then all these terrible * were too much for me i took two steps toward the grave reached out with a * to grasp the * whose * of blood seemed to burn themselves into my * * seized me and * my head fall i * when i * my * i was in my carriage supported by the arms of my wife and * up the avenue to my own house opposite me in the carriage little * who * realized apparently that some trouble had come to me was crying bitterly and a rough * was * to quiet his * the * in question was a * when i * at the grave my friends had caught me in their * with burning * that the charge against me was a base * the * who was * by judge conway to arrest me had declined to do more than direct a * to escort me home and see that i did not attempt to escape that was kind i was a * and my proper place a * why should i be more * than some poor common man charged with that crime had such a person been * with such a charge supported by such * evidence as the bloody * would any ceremony have been observed to * all would have cried no * for the * and why should the rich mr davenant be treated with more consideration on the day after my * spare you all the * scenes my poor * agony and every thing * the day after i got into my carriage and went and demanded to be confined in * it was the first time a davenant had ever been in * i went * without * if not without a * no sooner had i taken this step than the whole country seemed to have left their homes to visit me in my prison on the evening of the scene at the grave twenty persons had called at the pines to express their sympathy and * at the charge against me now when the iron door of the law had closed upon me and i was a real prisoner the visitors came in * without number one and all they treated the charge as the mere result of judge * * laughed at others * it as an attempt to * and destroy * were certain that an * would at once * my * and * me to liberty and honor alas i could only thank my friends and reply that i hoped that such would be the result but when they had left me alone i fell into * of the * * what * could i give that i was innocent there was a terrible * of circumstances on the contrary to support the * of my * more than i have mentioned colonel i had visited the courthouse on the same day with poor george conway and for the first time in twenty years had exchanged words with him and the words were * we had both been in the * office of the county when that gentleman asked me some * * what year such a person had died and his will had been * i think i replied * a year the * shook his head * that it must have been later and * to poor george conway who agreed with him * mr davenant is certainly in the wrong i was much * that * some * * george made a similar * and some * almost * words passed between us the affair went no further however i left the * office and having attended to the business which brought me left the courthouse about * as i mounted my horse i saw poor george conway riding out of the place i followed slowly not * to come up with him turning into a * which led toward my own * knew nothing of the murder until it was * abroad on the next day that is much like the special * of a * it not colonel if i had really * the poor man would not this be my * of * every thing you see i do not deny what several * could prove the fact that i * with conway came to high words uttered * exhibited * followed him from the courthouse at * * all that but add that i struck into a * and went home that sounds * i assure you even to myself today imagine the effect it promised to have then when i was a man charged with * would naturally try to frame such a statement as would clear * when a large portion of the community were excited and * at the murder such had been the truly unfortunate scene in the * * * which made me follow the man going to his death and my known * of long standing supported the * of my * there was another and even more fatal * * discovery of the * with which george conway had been * that * was my own it was one of peculiar * with a * of * and i had often used it in presence of my friends and others a dozen persons could make oath to it as my property but it was not needed the scene at the grave made that useless i evidently did not deny the * of the * which had been used in the commission of the murder at the very sight of it on the contrary in the hands of the brother of my victim i had turned pale and * this was the condition of things when the special term of the court held * to try me commenced at * a great crowd assembled on the day of the trial judge conway had * the * as * interested and the judge from a * * had taken his place below the seat of the judge sat the * outside the * the * were crowded so closely that it was with difficulty the * made a passage for my entrance to one resolution i had * in spite of the * of all my * * no * in this determination nothing could shake me a * pride * me mingled with bitter * if i the * of one of the * and most honorable families in the county of * was to be * as a * my past life my family and personal character did not * the * i was to be dragged to death on * * as a * because some * had * my * and committed a crime with * i would go to my death * i would * to frame * let the law murder me if it would no * * should save my life by * i would be * by god and my past life or would die such was my state of mind and such the * of my * to * * when the court now assigned me * i rose and * them to appear for me in the midst of a * scene and with the * * sitting * in his chair resolved to take no part in the trial the * appeared upon the stand and rather by * than the * consent the * proceeded to * them the circumstances which i have * to you were all proved in the * manner the * in the * office on the day of the murder my long * against him * back more than twenty years the fact that i had followed him out of the village just at * on the fatal night and the discovery of my * in the tall grass by the * near the body i had * no * but some appeared of their own * and gave important * many * * that my * toward george conway had almost entirely disappeared in the * of years and that i had spoken of him upon more than one occasion with great kindness the * of the county described the scene in his office * that the affair had appeared to him a mere * of * words without * of the least * on my part the most important witness however was a poor man living in the neighborhood who made oath that he had been riding toward the courthouse on the evening of the murder had passed mr conway and riding on farther came in sight of me and he had before reaching me seen me turn into the * which led toward my own residence i could not have committed the murder he added for mr conway had time to pass the spot where his body was found before i could have * back to the * and caught up with him unfortunately the witness who gave this * bore a very * character and i could see that more than one of the * * that he was * himself another * * also * to * the favorable impression thus made from the * * of * the fatal * had not been exhibited in court suddenly a * called for it and it could * be found the * * that he had left it in the * office where he supposed it to be entirely safe upon * for it however in the * where he had * it the * was * when that fact was stated i saw a curious expression pass over the faces of more than one of the * they evidently * * play was the door of the office locked asked one of them yes sir was the reply were the windows secured by * with * are all the * on the windows of this building firm i think so sir there is one that is not said the * and he pointed to a long iron * on one of the windows which bore evident * of having been * from its * the * looked in * in the direction indicated you are right sir he said some one has entered the courthouse by breaking open the * and * that * from the * office which is never locked a meaning silence followed the words it was not difficult to understand it the * looked at each other and in their * i could read * davenant is on trial for his life he or his friends * * to prove an * on the night of the murder and not * with that they * a * to enter the courthouse and * the * which * his connection with the * it may not appear in evidence against him the evidence closed i had not uttered a word i had * in my heart that i would not * a finger in the * now * beyond * i rose and addressed the * in * words their * i told them was of little importance if i was to lose the respect of my * i had made no effort to * their decision but now on the * it might be of a * grave i would utter my dying words i would * myself to * before god and on my honor that i had long since * george conway the * done * the scene on the day of his murder was the result of * * caused by business * and not * i had forgotten it in an * directly to my own * only heard of the murder on the day after its commission as to the * had been * if not charged with having had the * * well my answer to that was to * that to the best of my knowledge and belief the murder was committed with my own * more than that a witness had * that he saw me turn into the road to my own residence at such a distance behind george conway that i could not have * him before he had passed the fatal spot the witness was mistaken there was time by riding across the * through the * i could easily have * him and now gentlemen i said i have done i have left you no ground to charge me with * * having the evidence of my crime * * in darkness to * my crime and blind your eyes in * my * or * that * was mine i repeat it was possible for me to * mr conway and do him to death by a blow with it now retire gentlemen bring in your * thank god no * of real * will rest upon a davenant and i can appear before my * as i stand here * ten minutes afterward the * had retired with every mark of * upon their faces the great * of * seemed moved almost beyond control suddenly the crowd opened i saw my wife * through the space thus * living wall on each * in an instant she had thrown herself into my arms with a low cry which brought tears to the * faces of the * i placed my arm around her * with her for this * * and was trying to * her when she hastily gave me a letter a strange man had brought it an hour before she * was marked in * will save mr * life she had mounted her riding horse and brought it at full speed in person without waiting to question the stranger who had at once disappeared i opened the * at its * the same instant the * made their * the * said gentlemen of the * have you agreed upon a * we have sir said the * what is it not * the courthouse rang with * the crowd rushed toward me to shake me by the hand and * me suddenly in the midst of the * i heard the furious words * you have escaped but i * you before god and man as the * of my brother it was judge conway who mounted upon a * with * eyes * lips teeth * in a wild fury shook his arm at me and * me as a * before god if not before man general davenant was silent for a moment the deep voice so long * in my ears made the silence * now you know my dear colonel he suddenly added why my son can not form an * with a daughter of judge conway i bowed my head the whole * was * before me the family opposition is * said general davenant with a proud smile he * because he * that i * his * i object because he * it he * me * * the grave in the courthouse in public as in private and i could not think of * his honor to give his consent to the marriage of his daughter with the son of an escaped * the old soldier uttered these words with gloomy bitterness but in a moment he had * his * that was the end of the affair he said i went home accompanied by a * of friends who seemed never weary of * me and on the next day i wrote a * * to judge conway which i placed in the hands of a friend to * to him an hour afterward i had mounted my horse * rapidly caught up with this friend on his way to five forks and had taken from him the * which i * to pieces you will probably * the * which compelled me to do this it was not * to the modern form of single combat i am sorry to say old as i was i had still the ancient * on that subject i did not then know that * were mere * play that one infantry skirmish results in the * of more blood than all the affairs of a * the * that induced me to withdraw my * was one which you will probably understand the pale face of the dead george conway had * up before * knew his brothers deep love for * he regarded me as the dead mans * and i no longer * under that public * in the courthouse or at least * myself let him go on his way poor * heart i said with deep pity i forgive him and will not * that * to me such is my history colonel it is sad you see i have * it to explain what has come to your * bitter * which judge conway * toward me and his * at the very name of davenant these events occurred more than ten years ago during all that time he has been * under the belief that i am really * of his brothers blood see where my high pride has conducted me said general davenant with a smile of * melancholy and bitterness i was proud and * on the day of my * would not use the common * of * * my life by * * and * the * of that * pride * a sort of * at * a charge of base * was my sentiment then and i remain as * today i am a * was found not * go and tell judge conway the contents of that letter received in the courthouse the contents of the letter general yes colonel what did it * beg you to tell me the * of the * of george conway general davenant had scarcely uttered the words which i have just * when rapid firing was heard in the woods a quarter of a mile from his headquarters and a moment afterward a * came at a gallop bearing a * my horse came in the brief tone of command and general davenant * open the * which he read * the enemy are advancing to attack me he said this note was written ten minutes since the attack has commenced will you go and see it colonel * general davenant ordered another horse as my own was useless we mounted and rode at full speed through the woods in five minutes we were at the scene of action a heavy assault was in progress the enemy had * a large force in front of the hastily * * and were * by a determined charge to carry them general davenant was everywhere amid the fight the * and * head and beside him i saw distinctly in the * the brave figure of little * who had started from his * * on a huge sword and was now * to and fro cheering on the men as * as his father it was an * sight to see that child in his little * * with his * cap * * on his * * see his * cheeks his smiling lips and his small hand * that tremendous * as he * * amid the fire and yet i said there are those who will not believe in * race fill the space which that * * my dear reader with an * * of the head as a * went through my hat the charge was repulsed in twenty minutes but the firing continued throughout the night when it ceased toward * and i rode back with general davenant and * who was as gay as a * and entertained me with * of gettysburg i was completely broken down with * throwing myself upon a bed in general * tent i fell asleep when i opened my eyes the sun was high in the * i looked around for the general he was * i rose and at the door of the tent met * with bright eyes and cheeks like roses the general has gone to corps headquarters colonel and told me to present you his * and beg that you will remain to breakfast after which * and somewhat * sentence the youthful * drew near * me in a friendly way upon the back and exclaimed with * eyes i say colonel * that a * old * we had last night my reply was a laugh and a glance of admiration at the gay boy i declined the invitation of general davenant as i had to return my horse was brought and i found his foot much * in half an hour i was on the road to petersburg once back at the * i * deeply upon the history which i had heard from the lips of general davenant i shall * however from * these * if the reader will cast his eyes back over the pages of these * he will * that i have confined myself generally to the simple * of * * to offer my own * upon the scenes passing before me were i to do so what an * volume i should write and how the reader would be * now to bore a reader is in my eyes one of the greatest * of which an author can be * it is the * sin indeed in a writer for which reason and acting upon the theory that a * ought to explain itself and be its own * i spare the worthy reader of these pages all those * which i * in after hearing general * singular narrative pride pride i * rising at the end of an hour i think i can understand * as is this instance but i wish i had heard who was the real * of george conway having thus * the subject i set about drawing up my official report and this * * * soon * from my mind every more * subject it was nearly ten days after this my first ride into the * of * before i again set out to look after the cavalry the end of october was approaching grant had continued to * away along his immense line of * and day by day step by step he had gone on extending his left in the direction of

lee was lost unless he could mass his army and cut his way through the forces opposed to him and this fact was so * the situation was so * from the moment when the * road was seized upon by general

suddenly the blue lines * they were rushed by railroad toward petersburg and grant hastened to thrust his columns still farther beyond lees right in order to turn it and seize the * road that was not the * of a great soldier it may be reader but it was * general grant was not a man of great military * he was patient * and * to defeat lee what was wanted was genius or * or grant in the long run *

strike such was the critical condition of affairs when i again set out to make my regular * of * of the cavalry crossing * run at * mill i turned to the left and soon found myself riding on between the lofty walls of pine through which the roads of * wind like a * when near * neck i determined to stop and * my horse i always carried * behind my saddle a small * containing about a * of corn for that purpose and as i generally selected some * house where i could myself rest while my horse was * i now looked about me to discover such my search was speedily * three hundred yards from the road in a * of * trees i saw a small house which i soon reached the * of the * were poor and mean beyond expression through the open door i could see that the * was even more * than the outside as i dismounted a man came to this door are you fond of natural history reader and have you ever * yourself by * * between certain human * and certain * birds or * i have seen men who * horses * * * * this one * the bird called the * read the description of the * their feet are placed more * than in any other birds and only afford them support by resting on the * which is * like the sole of the foot of a * the wings are very small and are furnished with * of * only * * their bodies are covered with * * * to the touch and closely applied over each other their * are slow and * and from the form of their wings they can not * the individual before me recalled the * that he was * * instead of * the feet * with the above description the arms were short and hung like wings the coat of the worthy was a ragged * which ended in a point behind like the * of a bird and the movements of the individual were slow and * to a degree which * the * that under any circumstances he could be induced to * add a long * neck two * eyes a mouth * from ear to ear and a nose like the bill of a * you will then have before you the gentleman who bore as i soon discovered the * name of mr * when the worthy who had * his arms by way of * and shown me into his mansion informed me that such was his name i knew that the house at which i now found myself was the place of meeting agreed upon between nighthawk and swartz at their interview in richmond here also the man and woman * by swartz on the * had been left on his way to petersburg as the spy had informed us in the wilderness well general * mr * with a smile and in a * voice * the news i am only a * mr * well colonel any thing * nothing i think any news with you mr * i have heard of you from a friend of yours * and who * that be colonel mr nighthawk

well i * they are both dead or * a kept their * nighthawk dead he must be * you are mistaken friend * said a voice behind him and nighthawk in person entered the house nighthawk had appeared as was his wont as if he had * from the earth but this * disappeared from my mind at once i was looking at his face it had completely lost its * expression was pale and bore * of great * something of the old * * came to the eyes as he greeted me cordially but sitting down in the * chair as though completely * out he became as * as before and what * be the matter with you mr nighthawk said mr * you look s if the night * had been * of you with * on and mr * * his wings stretched out his neck and seemed about to * i am tired * said nighthawk * go to the spring and get me some fresh water you * come back in a * as i wish to talk with colonel surry and mr nighthawk rose and * sat down near the window through which he could * the object of this movement was soon evident mr * took a * and went out as though to seek the spring when he had gone a few * however he turned to the right and disappeared behind the house toward the opposite window which was open nighthawk rose went to the door and caught mr * * result of which was that the * hastily moved off * in a minute he had * along and disappeared no sooner had his figure * than nighthawk turned hastily toward me will you go with me tonight colonel on an expedition i intend to make he said an expedition nighthawk a work of mercy colonel let us talk quickly that man * is a * both * i wish to * every thing before he * explain nighthawk i will colonel do you remember that night in richmond when swartz made an appointment to meet me at a house near * neck perfectly well this is the * i expected important results from that meeting unfortunately i was prevented by some * who arrested me from reaching this spot on the appointed day i was here two days afterward * for * had not been * as that was the most * thing in the world to me i set out to find him in the enemys lines yes colonel i had no doubt i would come across him somewhere so i went through the country behind the federal lines looked everywhere for my man have been looking ever since i left * at last have found him where in the upper room of a deserted house not three miles from this place within the enemys * line the upper room of a deserted house * to * there colonel the work of darke and that * who goes about with him i am willing to * colonel good * is it possible i said swartz is shut up and left to * exactly * here is how i know it i was coming back worn out by my long search after swartz when in passing this house i came suddenly upon a * of about fifty men to avoid being seen i ran being on foot and got behind the house i had no sooner done so than i heard * from the upper part of * as the house was entirely * these sounds excited my * to say astonishment well i determined to find the * of them i * through a broken * the second floor by a * * and went straight toward a door behind which i heard the * it was heavily locked and i could not even shake it then i ran to the * between the room and the * it made of * between the * of which i could * looking in i saw swartz he was sitting on an old broken chair beside a table with three * and his hand was buried in his hair as if he was trying to * it out when i called to him he started and his * stopped he turned his head no sooner had he recognized me than he cried out with joy and for some moments he could say nothing but save me save me nighthawk they are * me to death i will not * out my story colonel i see * coming back i had scarcely exchanged ten words with swartz when i heard the gallop of a horse and running to the window saw that woman get off a * reflection told me that she was coming into the house i knew that if discovered i would be shot or taken * i decided on my course in a minute i said to swartz wait a few * will go and bring you help i * through a back window dropped to the ground ran into the * here i am colonel waiting for night to come to return and * swartz can you do so with one * look out while i * the * * go with you and provide for * too i had seen a * passing along the road in front of the house and as mr * came in at the same moment i sent him to * the * and bring him to the house as soon as mr * had left us on his * i * a * from my * obtained from nighthawk an * description of the * where swartz was confined and writing a note to mohun informed him of our intention if he could send a * of cavalry to drive in the * near the house it would * the success of our design i added as i finished this note mr * appeared with the * he proved to belong to * command i * the note to him * him that it was important and must reach mohun * i looked at my watch it was four oclock already the sun was * toward the * * i looked toward it and then at nighthawk who * in an hour colonel he said and as i am broken down i will sleep with these words nighthawk leaned back in his * chair covered his face with his * and in ten * his long quiet * showed plainly that he was asleep a * man * a * man is mr nighthawk said mr * and he * his arms and * about in a manner so extraordinary that he looked more like a * than ever night came on i left my horse at mr * set off on foot with nighthawk crossed the * * the * * by a * * in a * * and was approaching the house in which swartz was shut up nighthawk moved with the * and * step of a * i could see the man was a born * intended by nature for the calling he had * service he scarcely uttered a word when he did it was in tones so low that they were lost in the * of the wind amid the great * * * from the trees and i was compelled to * my ear close to catch the words fifty * from the bank a * object on horseback was visible by the dim light the * * nighthawk but he need not see us and * or rather * into the shadow of the trees he led the way without noise to a point directly in rear of the * a hundred yards farther a fire * and around this fire were the * figures of men and horses this was evidently the * three hundred * to the left rose a dark object * and * against the night which it * in * only in the upper portion of the house a dim light like a star * some one is yonder came from nighthawk in a * as before let us go there colonel and * down until his body nearly reached the earth my companion * * toward the house i * him we passed * and almost immediately were behind the house nighthawk then rose erect and said in a * i am going to * remain here colonel if i think you can come up without danger i will make you a signal through that window with these words nighthawk pointed to an open window about ten feet from the ground * past me through the broken * of one beside which we were standing and disappeared like a shadow i waited holding my breath from the upper portion of the house came the * sound of voices i was * to * the words uttered when i saw nighthawk appear at the upper window and make me a sign that sign indicated that i might * with a * amount of safety and passing without noise through the window i found myself in a bare and deserted apartment with a single * window opposite me on the right was an open door i passed through it and found myself at the foot of a rough * * half of a narrow passage * not without more than one * which i must confess sent a * through my * i reached the upper landing found myself in front of a closed door and beside this door encountered the warning hand of nighthawk look he said and drawing me toward him he pointed through a * in the board * which separated the passage from the apartment leaning on * shoulder i placed my eye at the * on a broken chair beside the * table sat darke * * and armed with pistol and * in an old * without arms the singular woman who seemed to accompany him everywhere sat * to and fro and * * with a small * the handsome gray * which * her slender and graceful figure * them on an old bed frame sat the unfortunate * i would scarcely have recognized him if i had not known that it was he his frame had fallen away almost to nothing his clothes hung upon him as upon a * * his cheeks were pale * his eyes * his bearing * * and * beyond expression let me spare the reader one horror however * was not * the unfortunate man at this moment beside him on the floor lay a piece of * and an * * it was evident that food had been brought to him and as some of that food remained * he must have satisfied his * from swartz my glance passed to darke this second * of the worthy proved to me that he was what is * * * but drink appeared not to have * him it seemed even to have made him more * in the eyes and lips of the heavily * * could be read a * of gloomy * something * bitter melancholy the woman in the gray dress had never appeared * she * to and fro in her chair with an air of perfect * the interview had evidently * some time before our arrival at the house but as the reader will * we came soon enough to * a somewhat singular * as i reached my position near the door darke was speaking to swartz you ask why you are shut up here to * he said and as i have some time on my hands tonight i am going to tell you that might be called * no i am talking to a dead man you see i hold out no false * will not leave this house alive * will go back and tell you something which will serve to explain the whole darke paused a moment and then gazed with a strange * of gloom and tenderness upon the gray woman perhaps you too madam he said speaking in a low tone may be ignorant of a part of my history you know the * not all you shall know every thing listen and i beg you will not * me about ten years ago i * to be at * courthouse a few miles only from this spot and one day a certain mr george conway visited the courthouse to receive a considerable * of money which was to be paid to him at the words a certain mr george conway uttered by the * in a * and * voice i very nearly uttered an * that name which general * * narrative had surrounded with so many gloomy * produced a profound effect on me as it now escaped from this mans lips and had it not been for * warning pressure on my arm i should probably have * our vicinity fortunately i * the rising * it had attracted no attention and darke went on in the same low tone i was in the * office of * when the money i * to was paid to mr conway it * to about ten thousand dollars and as i had at that time no business in the region more important than hanging around the tavern and * and playing * besides this i was at the end of my resources having lost my last * on the night before at the * idea occurred to me that it would not be a bad plan to ride after mr conway * him on the road * my * to him and request a small * out of his * means to prevent myself from being * of my * and * is that a * way of saying i intended to act the * perhaps * this occasion by no means madam what is * * is it not the * and * * of the poor as well as the rich well i was not going to rob * i was going to request a small * so far from * * * he uttered that word always in a * * * i had no such intention i was entirely * upon my whole person there was not one deadly * was only by accident that i found when riding out of the courthouse that i had a small * in my pocket this i had picked up by pure accident from the table of the * office where some one had laid it down i had * commenced * my * with * attention was attracted by something else i finished * my * and without being aware of what i was doing put the * in my pocket well you may think perhaps all this is * you are mistaken many things turned on that * the devil himself placed it in my grasp that day well darke continued i have told you my design and now i will * you how i carried it out i saw mr george conway receive the * notes bank notes and gold that was enough i knew the road he would take and going to the * of the tavern i * my horse and rode out of the place in a western direction when i was out of sight however i turned * toward five forks pushed into the woods and about sunset took my stand in a piece of * on the side of the road * coming by there was always a marked * when he came to the name of his victim he went on more rapidly now well he came along about * some one followed him but i could not make out who another man came on from the direction of petersburg passed me and him and the other who had followed him out of the courthouse turned into a * and disappeared then i saw that the game was in my own hands i waited looking at him as he approached me i * i did not intend to * him i was * but i remember what i intended he came on i rode toward him demanded the money he refused i threw myself on him as he struck at me with the * of his heavy * then we both rolled to the ground i under his * was on my throat i was * help he cried and i came near crying it too all at once my hand fell upon my pocket i felt the * i drew it out opened it and * him as he was * me that was the whole do you call it a murder i rose up as he fell back his breast was all bloody his eyes turned round he * something and fell back dead the * paused and * his brow with his huge * hand his face was a strange spectacle the most bitter and terrible * of the human heart were written there as with a pen of fire then i looked at him he went on i said to myself this is a murder * for he was * not * and my first thought was to * the body i dragged it to the * * it in some * and thinking i heard some one coming leaped on my horse who had stood by * had * * left the * spot as fast as i could go the money was left on him i * i did not touch a * of it and would not have touched it even if i had not been interrupted i had not intended to kill him it was the result of the struggle i took nothing of his away from that place but i left something of my own the * with which i had struck him the devil had put the * thing into my hand and now the devil made me drop it there within ten feet of the dead body darke had spoken in a low * gloomy voice and something like a * had passed through his frame as he painted in brief words the * scene this emotion now seemed even to grow * was there good left in this wild animal that * he continued was very nearly the means of hanging an innocent man it belonged to a gentleman of the neighborhood who had * laid it on the table of the * office a few moments before i as * picked it * this gentleman had just had * words * a * what made things worse was that they had long been * when he was found there dead in the * next day the * of the * found near the body was arrested as the * well he went to * and the trial was coming on soon the evidence against him was strong he was the known enemy * conway he had * with him on that day and his * was found * * which the money had not been touched a * you see would have taken the money as it was * the crime must have been committed by a personal enemy who was that enemy the * name was davenant well the trial was near i had gone back to the courthouse on that day and was still hanging around the place what was i to do i had to * whether i would let an innocent man be * for my crime or go to the * and say * the * am the * that was rather more than i was ready for and i * on a means which might serve the * was important * most * i was in the * office one day hanging round and listening when i saw the * put the * in a * to have it ready near court on the day of trial well that night i broke into the * the * waited to see what would * on the trial as the day drew near i felt like a real * and had the prisoner all the time before my eyes hanging on a * i * * than ever but i could not get that picture out of my mind i saw worse pictures than before so i determined what to do i sat down wrote a full * of the murder which i * and a friend of mine carried this to the prisoners wife i had put on it in haste this will save mr * * his wife carried it at full speed with her own hands to the courthouse where she arrived just as the * had retired the prisoner opened and read it when he had finished it he folded it up and put it in his pocket as he did so the * came in with a * of not * he went out of the * accompanied by a crowd of friends so he was * you * * the * which i had written that was in his pocket was of no further use and as it might become dangerous i entered his house that night broke open the desk in which he kept his private papers and took this one out reading and making sure that it was the * * by the light of the moon which * in at the window i was still looking at the paper when a noise behind me attracted my attention and turning round i * davenant he had heard the noise i made in breaking open the secretary put on his * and coming down pistol in hand was on me before i knew it the few minutes that followed were rather * and * * mr davenant did not fire on me after an * of * i put the paper in my pocket passed out through the window and * my horse rode away after that i went far and saw many persons among the rest you madam and our * life has been * a word to you now he added turning toward swartz i shut you up here to * you to death because you were trusted and have * me listen and i will tell you how you are * for gold and this * has * you to an act which will be your destruction in pennsylvania one night just before the battle of gettysburg you were at my house and stole a paper from madam who was * every thing to * it from the enemy no matter how i know that i have made the discovery and you deny * to * up that paper which you state you never had and consequently have not in your possession in saying that you * you stole that paper and promise yourself that you will * it for a large * of * have already been * and have tried to finish the business well that paper is * madam at least and she has kept it with care from the eyes of the very person you would * it to folded with it was another paper which is no less valuable to me thus you see that we are interested and we will probably be informed in a day from this time where to find both the * you will then be * and will * every thing you think me * * imagine i will spare you * * life is a small matter * with these two papers one is the * of * marriage with your very humble servant the other the letter which i took from mr * desk that night in which i confess myself * the * george conway * deep and gloomy voice ceased to * and for a moment the silence of the apartment was only * by the slight * made by the chair of the woman as she quietly * * and forward swartz had * to his feet while darke was * his final words with clasped hands and trembling lips he was about to throw himself upon his * suddenly a shot * without a cry was heard and then this was succeeded by rapid firing mingled with * in the immediate vicinity of the house darke rose to his feet and in two * was at the window an attack he exclaimed can the friends of this * be trying to catch me and * toward the door he * it open suddenly another thought seemed to come to him returning at a bound to the side of swartz he seized him by the throat dragged him through the door and rushed down the steps still * the unfortunate man as he passed me i drew my * and fired on him but the ball did not strike him then i saw the woman * past like a shadow when nighthawk and myself reached the foot of the * she and darke were already in the saddle the * of swartz was still in his * he seemed determined to bear him off at the risk of being himself captured for a second glance showed me that a party of confederate cavalry was * * toward the house led by an officer whom i made out to be mohun darke saw that the small force on * could not * with the * party by the * i could see his face as he * over his shoulder at mohun whom he had evidently recognized an expression of profound hate was in that glance a * * issued from his lips and i distinguished the low words addressed to swartz whom he was * on beside his horse so you are * you think you have laid this * for me * he drew his pistol as he spoke and placed it close to the unhappy mans temple i had mine in my hand and * at darke fired it was too late the * did not strike him and the report of his own * followed that of mine like an * swartz * back threw up his hands and * a wild cry fell at full length upon the ground the scene which followed was as brief as this tragedy mohun charged at the head of his men and drove the * force before him in five minutes the whole party were * or captured darke had escaped with the gray woman in the darkness the pursuit did not continue far the federal lines were near and mohun soon recalled his men * me cordially by the hand he exclaimed well surry the prisoner where is swartz i pointed to the spot where his body lay and went * with mohun swartz lay perfectly dead in a * of blood darke had * out his * an hour afterward the body of the unfortunate man had been buried and i had returned with mohun and nighthawk to the opposite bank of the * i had never seen mohun so gloomy he scarcely uttered a word during the whole march back and when i announced my intention to spend the night at the house of mr * as the long tramp had * me out he scarcely invited me to his headquarters and when i declined did not * me something evidently * heavily on the mind of mohun and a few moments reflection explained the whole to me he had * rapidly and apart with nighthawk near the lonely house and his gloom had * from that conversation nighthawk had evidently explained every thing the cause of * * his statement in reference to the * now that swartz was dead the * of the * seemed forever * if the reader does not understand the terrible * of this fact and * * gloom i promise that he shall * all before very long mohun returned to his camp and i remained at the house of mr * until morning stretched on a * and wrapped in my * i * about sunrise as i opened my eyes quick firing came from the direction of * mill the fire speedily became more rapid and * i hastened to mount my horse and as i did so a * passed at full gallop what news i asked the enemy are advancing in force they have crossed where near * and the * disappeared at full speed in the woods in a moment i had abandoned my design of * and was riding back * was a mill on the * near the * road if the enemy had crossed there in force it was to make a heavy advance toward the * road i was not mistaken reaching the * of the * road i found the cavalry drawn up in order of * * had been sent to * up the * the lower waters of the * and general hampton informed me of the situation of affairs the enemy had advanced in heavy force at sunrise driven in the * and crossing the * seized on the * road and the bridge at * mill from prisoners taken it was * that the force consisted of the second fifth and part of the ninth corps grant meade and * * the troops in person that left nothing in doubt if any remained it was * by the fact stated to me by general hampton that the federal troops had eight days rations and were certainly bound for the * road i had scarcely received this intelligence from general hampton when a heavy attack was made upon general william * lee holding the * road from that moment the battle began to rage with determined fury and the entire force of cavalry was engaged in an obstinate fight with the advancing enemy it was a bitter and * affair the men charged dismounted and fought behind * breastworks of * fell back only when they were pushed by the weight of the great column * forward and for hours the whole field was a * of dust smoke blood * * * * * and the long threatening roar of cannon the stuart horse artillery fought like * the men * to their guns amid a storm of * and * as they had done before on many fields the name of my * given them by stuart among the officers will davenant was seen sitting his horse amid the smoke as calm as a may morning and i shall never forget the smile on the face of this young * when he said i think we can hold our ground colonel and looking over his shoulder in the direction of five forks he * this is a good place to die too a * cheer rose suddenly above the roar of the guns and the line of dismounted sharpshooters behind their * breastworks opened a more steady and * fire as the enemy appeared to pause at the same moment young preston hampton a son of the general and one of my * from his courage and courtesy passed by at a gallop cheering and * the skirmishers i * after him just as i reached him i saw the arm waving above his head suddenly drop his sword escaped from his grasp and he fell from the saddle to the ground in an instant i had dismounted and with other officers who hastened up had raised him from the earth as we did so the group * now of no less than seven attracted the enemys attention a hot fire was opened on us and before we could bear the dying youth in our arms beyond the reach of the fire four out of the seven officers were shot the boy was placed in an * and borne to the rear but the wound was fatal and he soon afterward * a staff officer afterward informed me that general hampton did not leave his tent for a * * when he was spoken to and * by grief i could understand that the death of the brave youth sent a * to my own * he was only my friend the great heart of the father must have been nearly broken so fell preston hampton peace to his ashes no * or * spirit ever died for his country hour after hour the battle continued to rage the enemy making * * to * off the cavalry it was now discovered that * corps had crossed the * supported by * division with two corps behind and as general * held the bridge at * there seemed little * that lee could cross a force to attack him but this was done while the cavalry fought the blue * with obstinate courage on the * road * that daring soldier crossed a column of three brigades over the * below * and suddenly the enemy found themselves attacked in flank and rear * did not pause he advanced straight to the assault swept every thing before him and * his small force in between * and * * from the former four hundred prisoners three * and six pieces of artillery the assault had been sudden and almost * while * engaged with hampton in front the enemy had all at once * beneath the heavy blow * on their flank and rear they turned to strike at this new foe and the * which followed was rude the * bloody * met it with that * and * now * in the army and * his three brigades against the advancing column broke through three lines of battle and drove them back night was near and the fighting still continued the enemy seemed both to give up the ground and were holding their position * when a determined charge from a brigade of * drove every thing in its front i had been to carry a message for general hampton upon whose staff i served during the battle and now found myself swept forward by the brigade * in front of them i recognized general davenant on horseback and sword in hand leading the charge his son * was beside him we are driving them colonel exclaimed the general with a proud smile and look yonder are some of their general officers flying from that house as he spoke he pointed to three * riding at full speed from a house known as * their splendid suit of staff officers indicated that they were of high rank in fact the three * who retired thus hastily would have proved a rich * to us they were generals grant meade and * they made a narrow escape and the question * itself what would have been the result of their capture i know not i only know that grant meade and * came near having an interview with general lee that * peaceful and friendly talk at his headquarters i did not think of all this then the hot charge dragged me i had come to * in it by the mere chance of * this * accident was destined to have very singular results i had * with general davenant as his brigade swept forward and we were * a heavy fire on his front when a sudden cry of cavalry look out came from our left general davenant * his horse went at full speed accompanied by his son and myself through the * in the direction indicated and carried * by his animal as i was by my own rode right into a column of blue cavalry advancing to attack our flank such was the chance of battle at one moment general davenant was in command of a brigade which was driving the enemy and * every thing before it at the next moment he had been carried by the powerful animal which he * straight into the ranks of the federal cavalry hidden by the woods and approaching * been surrounded in an instant fired upon and half dragged from his saddle and captured together with his son * what was still more unfortunate to me * was the fact that having followed the old soldier i was surrounded and made a prisoner in the same manner we had scarcely time to realize the truly * fact that we were captured at the very instant that the enemy were being driven when the charge of the federal cavalry was met by a * of * which drove them back in * for some moments the woods presented a singular spectacle * flying in wild confusion * * * * toward the rear the * of wounded men * in the saddle as they rushed * this made up a wild scene of excitement and confusion worse * general davenant his son and myself had been ordered to the rear under escort and the old * had turned his horses head in that direction * with rage at his capture when the * ensued and the federal cavalry * by us toward the rear all at once a loud voice was heard * in the half darkness * * you * * * and form column the * rushed toward us as he spoke mounted upon a huge black horse and i heard the noise made by his * as with the * of it he struck * upon the * shoulders of the * at his * and the * of his * the men halted and again fell into column under the * * of the woods and in the gathering darkness the long line of * * * rather than men near them * some * * and the * light * their persons * on their * and * up the rough * faces * * exclaimed their leader in fierce * where are the prisoners that ran into us here colonel one is a general said a man let me see them general davenant struck the * * into his horse and rode close to the federal officer in whom i had recognized colonel darke here i am * at me exclaimed general davenant * with rage * be the day when i * a * and a * * hand * drew the * and man and horse both seemed to * back before the furious old soldier * * darke turning pale yes general * gentleman an honest man not a * and a * good god * darke it is my father * my little brother the proud face the eyes the * yet they told me you were killed ah killed * is a favorite * with you exclaimed general davenant * well kill me * your * sword or your * if you have one straight into my breast murder me i say as you * george * have a * in my pocket and you can rob me when i am dead strike * not with the sword that is the * of a gentleman draw your * and * me in the * * is the * of the * and crossing his arms upon his breast the fiery old * * his son with eyes full of bitter * and * which i shall never forget for their fire * them into my memory darke did not dare to meet them i had listened with * to those words which indicated that the federal officer was general * son then this sentiment of astonishment profound as it was had yielded to one of * if i may so express myself what i expected was a furious * from the man of fierce and violent * thus * and driven to bay by the repeated * of the general no * came however on the contrary the federal officer bowed his head and listened in silence while a * * * itself over his * face his gaze was bent upon the ground and his * so closely * that they extended in an * ridge of black and * hair above his * eyes he sat his horse in the light of the * huge * upon an animal as powerful and * in appearance as * for more than a minute after the * * from general davenant darke remained silent and * with his eyes still fixed upon the ground then he raised his head made a sign with his hand to an officer and said * move back with the * these prisoners here at the word the column moved back slowly the * figures were lost sight of in the darkness general davenant his son charles darke and myself were left alone beside the * then the federal officer with a face over which seemed to pass the shadow of * things looked first with a long * absorbed glance toward the boy charles his * toward his father why do you * me he said in a low tone will that result in any good now yes i committed murder i intended if i did not * * i * i * a * a * * but i do not wish to kill * * this * rob you keep your life and your money there is the road before you open go you are free general davenant had sat his * boy * beside * in * * as darke ended the generals hand went to the * of his sword and he half drew it by an * movement from the * well added the federal officer in the same low tone with a * * in his cheeks draw your sword * me if you think proper for myself i am done with murder and * from it so that if my father wishes to kill me i will open my breast to give him a fair opportunity you see i am not altogether the * * you take me for i am a * it is true and * with every * see i am * i will not resist if you * your sword into my heart strike strike while i am dying i will have time to say the few words i have to say to you general davenant * with * still but a strange emotion was mingled with the sentiment * emotion which i could not * before he could open his lips however darke resumed in the same tone you * are not ready to become my * well listen and i will utter that which may * you of all * yes once more i killed a man and killed him for money but you made me what i was you * and * and made me * in addition you * man you had * him for twenty years when i grew up i found out that if you did not strike him you had the desire to do * like a good son i shared my fathers loves and * i heard you speak * i knew that an old * was between you what matter if i met this enemy of the family on the * and with the * at his throat said yield me a portion of your * * for that money was the * of a forced * for * by which the father of a family was turned out of house and home well i did * did it under the effect of drink i learned the habit at your table wine was placed in my hands in my very childhood by you you * all my * * made me a miserable * * i came to * about the village tavern and * and * myself until i was made * then when one day the devil * me i committed a * that crime was committed by you for you * in me the * * which led me on to murder * eyes were gloomy and full of a strange fire as he uttered the last words he * close to his father * open his uniform until his bare breast was visible and added in * full of * and * * strike me * your * point in my heart i am your son you are as noble a gentleman as * was kill me then i am a * but i am a davenant and no * from the fierce and * face in which the dark eyes burned like * my glance passed to the countenance of general davenant a * change had taken place in the expression of the old * he was no longer erect fiery * his glance no longer * * and * his * had fallen upon his breast his frame * his cheeks but now so flushed were covered with a deep * for a moment he remained silent the hand which had * at the sword * hung * at his side all at once his breast * and with a sound which * a * he said in low tones i am * yes my * has brought forth * and the * is bitter it was i who * this life and the tree has grown as i * it yes said darke in his deep voice first * when cut down cast off and forgotten general davenant looked at the * with bitter melancholy ah you charge me with that do you sir he said you do not remember then that i have suffered for * do not know perhaps that for ten years i have * under the * of that crime and have * silence that i might * your * i thought you dead you do not know that i never breathed a * of that letter which you sent to me on the day of my * i have allowed the world to believe i was saved by a * * you have not heard perhaps that a daughter of judge conway is beloved by your brother and that her father * with * the very idea of forming an * with my * son of one whom he * as the * of his brother oh yes sir truly i have cast off and forgotten you and your memory i have not wept tears of blood over the crime you * the * that rested on the name of davenant i have not * beneath the cold and * eye of judge conway and his friends i have not seen your brothers heart breaking for love of that girl and * all concealed every thing borne the * on my proud forehead and his young life that your * might at least not have * cut on it and now you * me with my * my * course toward you when your character was forming you * and say that i first * george conway and that the son only * the family * and struck the enemy of the family yes i * those * i pray daily to be * for them i have borne for ten years this bitter * of * but there is something more * even than my * and the * on my * is to be * to my face here with the charge that i struck that blow that i made you the * and then threw you off and drove you to become a * in the ranks of our enemies the last words of the * were nearly * in a heavy * which issued from the woods close by listen exclaimed general davenant that is the fire of your * sir directed at the hearts of your * you are leading that * against the gentlemen of virginia well join them point me and my son and companion out to them * us to pieces with your * * us beneath your * * that will not prevent me from * you again in your * * * you as * * and * the * of * mingled with these furious and * words and then the * of * was heard the * suddenly * with * party of confederates rushed * into the little * darke * not from but toward them as though to charge them the stern courage of the davenant blood burned in his cheeks and eyes then with a * and bitter laugh he turned and pushed his horse close up beside that of his father i would call this meeting and parting strange if any thing were strange in this world he said but nothing * me or * me as of old the devil has brought it about he put a * in my hands once tonight he * me face to face with you and my * makes you * and * me well so be it have your will henceforth i am really * father and drawing his pistol he * * * after * in the faces of the men * upon him * his horse and * the * into him an instant afterward with his * face turned over his shoulder he had disappeared in the woods two hours afterward i was on my way to petersburg the enemy were already falling back from their * attempt to seize the * road in the morning they had retired across the * and disappeared so ended that heavy blow at lees great * i was again back at the * after the rapid and * scenes which i have * to place before the reader the tragic * * the * in this * had most absorbed my attention but sitting now in my tent with the newspapers before me i looked at the fight in which i had * from the general and * point of view that heavy advance on the * road beyond lees right had been * with a determined assault on the confederate left north of james river and on lees centre opposite petersburg and now the * from northern * clearly indicated that the movement was meant to be decisive i have richmond by the throat general grant had * but there was good ground to believe that the heavy attack and the * * were both meant to make capital for the approaching * election these * my dear reader are written * to record some * which i witnessed during the war i have neither time nor space for political * but i laid my hand yesterday by accident on an old number of the * * and it * to * an * on the fight just described with some * views on the situation at that time shall i * a * from the yellow old paper it will be * were all bitter in those days though today we are so * and * with his * pen * * to the * of the matter and the paper may give some idea of the spirit of the times i could fancy the great * sitting in his lonely study and * the lines i shall * not without grim smiles at his own * * here is the * i cut out the old familiar * may recall those times to some readers as clearly as the * * once read perhaps by the * daily * monday morning * # 1864 every day must now bring its brilliant * to the yankee nation that nation does not regard the * rising of the sun as more * due to it than a victory every morning and those glorious * of sheridan in the valley were grown cold and * and even plainly * and * that after * * the army of early at least three times and so * the way to lynchburg instead of marching up to lynchburg the * * goes * down to winchester then the * victory obtained on sunday of last week over price in missouri has taken a certain * * which causes many to believe that there was in fact no victory and no battle this would not do something fresh must be had something * above all something that would set the people to cheering and firing off * about the very day of the * too that could not be plainly * by the events till after that critical * let the * come and welcome your true yankee will only laugh from this necessity came the great * in force of last * on our lines before richmond and petersburg a * in very heavy force indeed upon three points of our front at once both north and south of the james river so that it may be very * considered as three * in force made with a view of feeling as it were lees position and the object of the three * having been fully * is lee having been * retired that is the way in which the * of * last are to appear in * * we may be all quite sure and this * together with the * of a part of the * * which road the newspapers can call for a few days the * road will cause every city from boston to * to fire off its * hundred guns thus the * election will be served just in the * of time for that * it is not the real victory which is wanted so much as the * * and cannon * even when the truth comes to be fully known that this was the grand * assault itself the * advance on richmond which was to * the * into power again upon a * * of glory * repulsed and sent * back with a loss of about six or seven thousand men in killed wounded and prisoners even when this is known does the reader imagine that the yankee nation will be * very far from it on the contrary it will be easily made to appear that from these * in force an advantage has been gained which is to make the next advance a sure and * success for the fact is that a day was chosen for this mighty movement when the wind was * a soft and gentle * which * the * of the yankee * to the * of confederate soldiers the confederates ought to have been taken by surprise that morning but the moment they * the * * they knew what was to be the * work not more * is the * which calls the * to the battlefield before a drop of blood is shed or that which makes the * know well the long stern * that * the * close than the sure * of our army that the yankees are coming on when * or noon or * * * along the whole line a * * of the ancient * the way in which this discovery may be * is plain it will be felt and understood throughout the * north that it gives them at last the key to richmond they will * rebels to * of us * the rising * of our loyal soldiers the * and * of a hundred thousand * * the sweet south as if it had passed over a bed of violets * and giving * the wind is * it will be said rebels know a * from a * therefore it is but making our next grand assault on some morning when they are to * of * up in the lee of lee as if he were a * richmond is ours that is * and sounds * today when peace and good feeling * the walls of the virginia capitol * the stately voices of the * fathers of the great * and mother of states * fathers bringing their wisdom * study and experience to the work of still further * the work of jefferson * and washington i have richmond by the throat general grant wrote in october 1864 in february # when these lines are written black hands have got virginia by the throat and she is * * * * * * of the old mother make him laugh * of the great * she gave you being and * you are you going to see her * before your very eyes in truth if not held by the throat as general grant announced richmond and all the south in that autumn of 1864 was * * * to and fro under the immense * of * war at that time black was the only wear and * and * were crying in every house throughout the land bread and *

everywhere something * the executive was * the heads of * were * the army was * the * were * in congress the opposition bitterly * president davis the press * with fierce * * and * on all subjects the

young women who continued to walk quietly or to trip along laughing and * to buy a * or some * at the stores that seemed singular then and seems more singular today but there is nothing like being accustomed to any * the * had now lost its interest and troubled nobody good i said laughing our friends yonder are * us their * today they have * probably on the * of * sent from new england and are * themselves * us by way of * and * to have a better view of the lines i rode toward * do you remember the * * of the old * church my dear reader this is one of our virginia * and is worth seeing around the * the large * is full of * * many are * today however by the federal shell as the spot was near the breastworks and in full range of their artillery in fact it was not a place to visit in the fall of 1864 unless you were fond of shell and a * * i was somewhat surprised therefore as i rode into the * a hot skirmish going on a few hundred yards * see a young officer and a * sitting on a grass bank beneath a * tree and * in the most * manner * who were these * * * their * were turned and i could only see that the young lady had a * of * hair having dismounted and approached i made another discovery the youth was holding the * hand and looking with flushed cheeks into her * she hung her head the * * over her cheeks and played * with some wild flowers which she held between her fingers the situation was plain * i said to myself let me not * the young ones and i turned to walk away without * their attention unfortunately however a shell at that instant * over the ruin the young girl raised her head with simple * a * of fear * watch the course of the * and as the youth * the like * they both became aware of my presence at the same moment the result was that a * laugh * among the * and that the youth and * rose * rapidly toward me an instant afterward i was pressing the hand of * dare whom i had left near * and that of tom * whom i had not seen since the fatal day of yellow tavern the * * of * dare were as * as ever her blue eyes had still the charming * which had made me love her from the first indeed her * toward me had been full of such * * that it made me her * and i now pressed the little hand and looked into the pretty * face with the sentiment which i should have * toward some favorite * * made you feel thus by her * and * smile how * from loving one whose blue eyes laughed like her lips and whose * said i am * since you came and tom was equally friendly his face radiant his appearance distinguished he was * in a new uniform half covered with gold * his hat was * with a magnificent black * his cavalry * reaching to the knee were small delicate and of the * * at a * * * * must have cost him three thousand * tom he * my hand with a * which evidently came straight from the heart for he had a * * * old fellow here you are tom cried laughing you came upon us as suddenly as if you had * from heaven * you would like to send me back am i wrong tom and i shot a glance of ancient and * affection at these two young things whose * i had interrupted * * * and then ended by laughing tom * his slender * and said my dear fellow i certainly should like to go to * to send my friends * if it is all the same to everybody i think i would * the journey for a brief period my boy until an angel is ready to go with you and i glanced at the angel with the * ah my dear surry said tom * his * with his hand you really have a genius for * which is * and not to be * let the angel sit in judgment oh you have most * * i learned it all from you from me my boy * the beauty of * in * and looking at the * i began to repeat * * dont marry any other * break my heart and kill me dead and then be * for murder the amount of * laughter * good * and * generally which this * * was charming in a few minutes we were all seated again on the * bank and tom had given me a history of his * which had not been either numerous or remarkable he had been assigned to duty on the staff of general fitzhugh lee and it was delightful to hear his enthusiasm on the subject of that gay and gallant officer i tell you * a * old fellow * tom with * * as brave as * a * officer a * gentleman generous kind and as * as a * give me fitz lee to fight with or march with or hear laugh he was shot in the valley and i have been with him in richmond in spite of his wound which is a severe one he is as gay as the sunshine and it would put you in good spirits only to go into his chamber i know general fitz well tom i replied and you are right about him every word you say is true and more to * old fellow so you are * around now waiting for your chief to recover exactly my dear surry and have captured the * * * * miss * * her head with a * and a laugh * of * i said who make * even in their * now tell me miss * if you are on a visit to petersburg it will give me true pleasure to come and see you indeed you must she said looking at me with the most * smile

between him and his surgeon but i am told he is ordered to * as soon as he is up the country is a new one the thought has occurred to me that any information i can * * * * would be valuable you * do you not my dear friend you appreciate my * perfectly tom there will probably be a battle near * and * better ride over the ground * yes well ill do it only * of one thing what my dear surry asked tom * there is probably a * at * a * like that near * and the battle might take place there if it * to one you are * * * * smiled * and burst into laughter then * my eye she raised her finger and shook her head with * * looking at tom he was laughing all right ill look out surry * on one thing tom what is that that you will never surrender but be taken in arms with which * and * * i shook hands with tom * him where to find me made miss * a bow which she returned with a charming smile and a little * which shook together her * and then leaving the young people to themselves i mounted my horse and returned to the * all the way i was smiling a charming influence had * upon me the day was * the sunshine * for the sight of the young fellow and the pretty little * with her blue eyes like the * and her * of * gold when i again set out for the cavalry a few days after the scene at * church the youth and sunshine of those two faces still * in my memory and i went along smiling and happy not even the scenes on the late battlefield beyond the * made my * gloomy and yet these were not gay * were seen everywhere the * were broken down the houses * by * and in the * roads and fields negroes were * the dead horses to make shoes of their * on the * already * sat huge * * my horse * as the black * rose suddenly on * wings they only * around however * back as i disappeared such is war * charming * of dead bodies and * turning into the * road i went on until i reached the headquarters of general william * lee opposite * neck here under the crest of a * hill where the pine * * him * from the wind that gallant soldier had set up his * is to say a * * one end of which was closed with a * * of * my visit was delightful and i shall always remember it with pleasure where are you today general and good comrades of the old staff you used to laugh as hard as you * your * was immense heaven grant that today when the * are silent the * * you are laughing as in the days i remember * the friendly invitation to spend the night i went on in the afternoon and on my way was further * by a gay scene which makes me smile even today it was in passing general * headquarters near the * in the woods *

and * in the moonlight night they were old songs of * and stuart * * of the struggle which the winds have borne away into the night of the past and which now live only in memory there was one of * *

sound no more but i think you sometimes remember as you * in these * years those gay moonlight nights on the banks of the * these memories are * and while they possess me my * does not march but you have not been * i hope my dear reader by this little * * of the brave horse * i found myself among them the moonlight shone the voices sang and i have paused to look and listen again in memory these scenes however can not possess for you the * they do for me to proceed with my narrative i shall pass over my long conversation with will davenant whose bed i shared i had promised his father to * nothing of the events which i had so * * was then only able to give the young man * * of a coming change for the better in his affair with miss conway he * me * and trying to * then we fell asleep beside each other just at daylight i was suddenly aroused the * notes of a * were * through the woods i extended my arm in the darkness and found that will davenant was not beside me what had happened i rose quickly and throwing my * over my shoulders went out of the tent the horse artillery was already * up and in motion the * moon * the grim * * and heavy horses moving with * * behind came the men on horseback laughing and ready for combat as i was * at this * scene so suddenly * will davenant rode up and pointed to my horse which was ready * and attached to a * of the great tree i thought i * * you colonel he said with a smile but let you sleep to the last moment the enemy are advancing and we are going to meet them he had scarcely spoken when a rapid firing was heard two or three miles in front and a loud cheer rose from the * in a moment the guns were * on at a gallop and as i rode beside them i saw a crimson * * up above the woods in the direction of the * railroad the firing had meanwhile grown * and the guns were rushed * will * whole appearance had completely changed the youth so * in camp so cool in a hot fight seemed * up with * at the delay caused by the terrible roads his voice had become * and * he was everywhere * on the * when the horses * in the * * he would strike the * in a sort of rage with the * of his * * them with a * which made the * * to * the piece out of the * and * a glance told me then what was the secret of this mere boys splendid * under the * * face was the * and will of the born * * boy had become the master mind and drove on every thing by his stern will in spite of every * to * the * in the roads it was nearly sunrise before we reached open ground then we * upon the * near * and saw a * spectacle from the hill we could make out every thing a hot cavalry fight was going on beneath us the enemy had evidently crossed the * lower down and driving in the * had passed forward to the railroad the guns were rushed toward the spot * on a rising ground and their thunder rose suddenly above the * shell after shell burst amid the enemy breaking their ranks and driving them * by the time i had * through a * of woods to the scene of the fight they lost heart retreated rapidly and disappeared driven across the * again with the confederates * them so * that many of the gray cavalry * them in the back with their empty * their object in crossing had been to burn a small mill and in this they had succeeded after which they retired as soon as possible to their own side some * scenes had accompanied this tremendous military movement in a house near the mill * some ladies and we found them * * at the course of the enemy the federal * * ordered the * to be * up the carriage to be drawn into the * and then * were * around and the whole set on fire amid * cheers and firing the lady of the mansion * bitterly but received little satisfaction i have no time to listen to women said the federal general * it is not time that you want sir returned the lady with great * it is * this greatly * the person whom she addressed and he became furious when the lady added that all the horses had been sent away at that moment an officer near him said general if you are going to burn the * you had better * as the * are * us order it to be done at once was the * reply and the mill was fired in the midst of a great * with which mingled * of the rebels are coming the rebels are coming soon they came a hot fight followed and during this fight a young woman watched it holding her little brother by the hand near the burning mill i had afterward the honor of making her acquaintance and she told me that throughout the firing she found herself * over and over * the lines of the song charge stuart pay off * * in stonewall jacksons way the enemy had thus effected their object and retreated * pursued i followed toward the lower * and had the pleasure of seeing them hurried over so ended this immense military movement i was about to turn my horse and ride back from the stream across which the enemy had disappeared when all at once mohun who had led the pursuit rode up to me and we exchanged a cordial * well this little affair is over my dear surry he said have you any thing to occupy you for two or three hours nothing entirely at your service mohun well i wish you to accompany me on a private expedition will you follow me * * and i rode on beside mohun who had struck into a path along the banks of the * leading back in the direction of * bridge as we rode on i looked * at him i scarcely recognized in the * beside me the mohun of the past his gloom so profound on that night when i parted with him after the expedition to the lonely house beyond * neck had entirely disappeared and i saw in him as few * of the days on the rappahannock in pennsylvania and the wilderness these * steps in the * of * character may be indicated by * them the first second and third * of the individual he had entered now upon the third * and i * him * with his former * on the rappahannock when i saw him first mohun had been * bitter full of gloomy * something seemed to have * him and made him hate his * in the * of early * when his life was yet in the flower and should have * him to all kind and sweet * he was a stranger to * charity * friendship all that makes life * the tree was young and * the spring was not over * and * should have * it and yet it appeared to have been * what had * up its * i asked * and * it what * had struck this * young oak i could not * from the first moment of our acquaintance mohun became for me a * then the second * presented itself when i met him in the wilderness in may 1864 a great change had come over him he was no longer bitter and * the cloud had plainly swept away leaving the * of his life * * had succeeded gloom the * * of the true * had * the * of the * again i looked at him with * his courage had made me * him and his hidden grief had aroused my sympathy a great weight had plainly been lifted from his shoulders he breathed * the * long * up had begun to * again and the * told that the leaves of youth and hope were about to * what was the meaning of that now the third * of the man had come to * in me more surprise and interest than the former ones this time the change was complete mohun seemed no longer himself was the man riding beside me the old mohun of 1863 where was the gloomy * the * * they had quite disappeared * glance was gentle and his countenance filled with a charming * and * his voice once so cold and then so * had grown calm low * almost soft his smile was * cordial his glance full of * and * the * spirit of * * for all the * of human * in his eyes on his lips in every * of his voice colonel mohun had been reckless * unhappy or * gay general mohun was calm quietly happy it seemed you would have said of him formerly this is a man who * from * of his enemies or the * life in him now you would have said this is a * who * from principle and is worthy to die in a great cause what had worked this change i asked myself once more was it love or was it the * which the * * to the most * that life is not made to * * but to love and * our duty in i knew not but there was the * before me mohun was certainly a new man and looked on life and the world around him with a * and kindness of which i had believed him * i am going to take you to see a somewhat singular character he said who is he it is a woman ah and a very strange one i promise you my dear surry lead on ill follow * good and i * to you i think * would have * this human being with attention she is a * then yes a * no an * at least i think so indeed and where does she live on the * road some miles from the * in the lines of the enemy then something like it * dont * yourself about that surry i have sent out a * party who are * the country their * are back to * by this time and there is little danger at all events well share any mohun forward and we pushed on to the * bridge where as mohun expected there was no federal * the * long rough * been half destroyed by general hampton but we * near it pushed our horses through the swamp amid the heavy tree * * to form an * and * the opposite bank of the * rode on rapidly in the direction of petersburg that is to say toward the rear of the federal army half an hours ride through the * low grounds rising to gentle * and beneath the * of the great * * from tree to tree brought us in front of a small house half buried in a * of * like a * * amid * we have arrived said mohun leading the way to the * which we soon reached throwing his * over a * near the low * mohun approached the door on foot i following and when close to the door he gave a low * come in said a cheerful and smiling voice and mohun opened the door through which we passed into a small and very * apartment containing a table some * a wide * in which some * were burning a number of * * of religious scenes * and hanging on the wall and a low bed upon which lay a woman fully dressed she was apparently about * and her appearance was exceedingly curious her figure was slender and of * height her * that of a * or * woman rather than that of the * which she appeared to be her hair black waving and * her eyes as dark and * as * * and her teeth of * * her dress was * and of bright colors around her neck she wore a very * * which seemed made of * * and her slender fingers were * with a number of * such was the * who greeted us in a voice of great * and * as we entered she did not rise from the bed upon which she was lying but her cordial smile clearly indicated that this did not * from * take * gentlemen she said and please excuse me from getting up i am a little * today stay where you are * said mohun and do not * yourself she looked at him with her dark eyes and said in her gentle friendly voice you know me i see general mohun and you me i see * i never saw you before sir * i mistaken not in the least how did you know me the singular * smiled i have seen you often sir * your * yes sir or perhaps nighthawk described me you know mr nighthawk oh yes sir i hope he is well he has often been here he may have told me what you were like sir and then i saw you to know you afterward i looked at the * * was she an * it was impossible to think so there was absolutely no evidence whatever that she was acting a * every thing to * the * as she thus * * in * simple explanation for some moments mohun remained silent then he said those * which you have are very strange is it possible that you really see things before they come to * are you only * yourself and others by saying so i see no * * in the matter if you are * but tell me for my own satisfaction and that of my friend if you really see things * smiled with * * i am in earnest sir she said and i would not * with you and colonel surry i listened in astonishment ah you know me too * yes * i think i do i think you are colonel surry sir how do you know that i have seen you too sir was the smiling reply i sat down leaned my head upon my hand and gazed at this * being was she really a * i do not believe in * and at once * that theory if not an * then only one other theory * nighthawk had described my person to her in the same manner that he had * and the woman might thus believe that she had seen me as well as my companion in her * to her last words however i made no reply and mohun renewed the * as before then you are really in earnest * and actually see in vision what is coming to pass he said i think i do sir do you have the * often i did once sir but they now * come what * them i think it is any excitement sir they tell me that i lay on my bed * and moving my arms * when i * after these * i remember seeing the * i hear that you * general * attack on lexington last june yes sir i told a lady what i saw some months before it came to pass what did you see will you repeat it for us oh yes sir i remember all and will tell you about it as it seems to interest you i saw a town on the other side of the mountain which they afterward told me was called * i did not know its name * a great army of men in blue * came marching in * and cheering the next thing i saw was a large building on fire and through the windows i saw books burning with some * things of which i do not know the names the military * with the books and * * said mohun * was it sir i did not know what did you see afterward * another house burning sir the federal people gave the ladies ten minutes to leave it and then set it on fire mohun glanced at me that is strange he said do you know the name of the family no sir it was governor * well what next then they went in a great crowd and broke open another * large house * took every thing among the things they took was a * which they did not break up but carried away with them * * * mohun and turning to me he added this is curious is it not surry i * very curious i confess i believed that the strange woman was * with us and had simply made up this story after the event mohun saw my * and said in a low tone you do not believe in this no i returned in the same tone and yet one thing is remarkable what that a lady of the highest character assured me the other day that all this was * to her before * even entered the valley and turning to * he said when did you see these things i think it was in march sir the words were uttered in the * manner possible the strange woman smiled as * as she spoke and seemed as far from being * of a * * as before and you saw the fight at * too yes sir i saw it two months before it took place there was a man killed running through the yard of a house and they told me afterward he was found dead there have you had any * since only one sir * yes sir what did you see it was not much sir i saw the federal people on horses * their horses in a large river somewhere west of here and the vision said the war would be over about next march mohun smiled which side will be successful * the vision did not say sir mohun who had taken his seat on a rude * leaned his * on his knee and for some moments gazed into the fire i have asked you some questions * he said at length * to public events i now come to some private * which brought me * which your singular * may probably assist me are you willing to help me yes indeed sir if i can was the reply mohun fixed his * and yet * glance upon the singular woman who * it however with no change in her calm and smiling expression you know nighthawk oh yes sir he has been here often and swartz very well * have known him many years have you seen him * no sir not for some weeks ah you saw him some weeks since yes sir at this house yes sir do you know what has become of him no sir but i suppose he is off somewhere he is dead her head rose slightly but the smile was * you dont tell me sir yes * perhaps you know his * who was it sir colonel darke oh i know him he has been here * poor mr swartz and so they * him i am sorry for him * glance became more * you say that colonel darke has been here * yes sir what was the occasion of his visit i dont know sir unless it was to hear me tell my * you never knew him before * * yes sir she said at length when and how it was many years ago * do not like to speak of these things he is a terrible man they say you can speak to me * i will repeat nothing nor will colonel surry the singular woman looked from mohun to me evidently * then she seemed suddenly to make up her mind and said with her eternal smile i will tell you then sir i can read faces and i know neither you nor colonel surry will get me into trouble i will * my honor nor i i said that is enough gentlemen and now i will tell you what you wish to know general mohun as she spoke she closed her eyes and seemed for some moments to be * then opening them again she gazed with her calm smile at mohun and said it was many years ago sir when i first saw colonel darke who then went by another name i was living in this same house when late one evening a light carriage stopped before the door and a gentleman got out of it and came in he said he was * with his wife who had been taken sick and would i give them * until morning when she would be able to go on i was a poor woman sir as i am now and hoped to be paid i would have given the poor sick lady * all the same * i told him he could come in and sleep in this room and i would go into that * place behind you sir well he * me and went back to the carriage where a lady sat he took her in his arms and brought her along to the house when i saw that she was a very beautiful young lady but quite pale well sir she came in and sat down in that chair you are now sitting in and after * said she was better the gentleman had gone out and put away his horse and when he came back i had supper ready and every thing comfortable what was the appearance of the lady said mohun over whose brow a * passed she was small and dark sir but had the * eyes i ever saw the same said mohun in a low tone well they stayed all night sir next morning they paid * it was * went on toward the south they seemed poor yes sir the * dress was * and * the * * what names did they give mr and mrs * sir * brow again * well go on he said or rather go back * you say that they remained with you until the morning did you not hear some of their * some knowledge of whence they came * they were going and what was the object of their journey the woman * * at mohun then she smiled and shook her head you will get me into trouble sir she said i will not upon my honor you have told me enough to enable me to do so * not tell me all you say you slept in that * * you must have heard them * i am * to know * me what they said and taking from his * a piece of gold mohun placed it in the hand extended upon the bed the hand closed upon * it the eye of the woman * and i saw that she had determined to speak it was not much sir she said i did listen and heard many things but they would not interest you on the contrary they will interest me much it was a sort of * i * sir mr * was * his wife for something and said she had brought him to misery she replied in the same way and said that it was a strange thing in him to talk to her so when she had broken every law of god and man to marry the the mohun repeated * forward the * of her father she said sir returned * mohun started and looked with a strange expression at me you understand he said in a low tone is the thing * let us hear more i said gloomy in spite of myself go on mohun said turning more * toward the woman that was the reply of the lady * she had broken all the laws of god and man by * the * of her father did she utter the name of her father yes sir what was it a mr george conway replied * who seemed to feel that she had gone too far to * any thing and the reason for this marriage said mohun in a low tone did she explain or say any thing which explained to you how such a union had ever taken place yes sir they said so many things to each other that i came to know all the young lady was a daughter of a mr george conway and when she was a girl had fallen in love with some * young man who had * her to * with him and get married he soon deserted her when she fell in with this mr * and married him did she know that he was her fathers * no * until after their marriage i gathered then said mohun who had * all * of emotion and was listening * then it seems to me that she was wrong in taking shame to * * * the marriage yes sir returned * and he told her as much so they had something like a * not exactly a * sir he seemed to love her with all his * than she loved him they went on talking and * plans to make money in some way i remember he said to her you are sick and need every * would rather die than see you * of * would * or rob to supply you every * we must think of some means honest or * to get the money we want i do not care for myself but you are all that i have left in the world that is what he said sir and * was silent then they fell asleep asked mohun yes sir and on the next morning he took her in his arms again and carried her to the carriage and they left me mohun leaned his * upon his hand * his * and * the singular narrative * me too into a * this man darke was a * * of * life full of hidden and * things the son of general davenant he had * his fathers foe permitted that father to be tried for the crime and to remain under * disappeared changed his name encountered the daughter of his victim married her had those * * with mohun disappeared a second time changed his name a second time and now had once more made his appearance near the scene of his first crime to murder swartz capture his father and brother and complete his tragic record by fighting under the enemys flag against his country and his family there was something * in that career in this mans life deep under deep met the eye and yet he was not entirely bad on that night in pennsylvania he had refused to strike mohun at a * had borne off the gray woman at the * of death or capture he had * his captured father and brother * his head before them he had * the murder of george conway over his own * to save this father the woman who was his * he seemed to love more than his own life such were the extraordinary * in a character which at first sight seemed entirely * and i * with * interest upon the singular * i was aroused by the voice of mohun he had never appeared more calm in his deep tones i could * no emotion whatever that is a singular story he said and your friend colonel darke is a curious * but let us come back to events more * the visits of swartz yes sir said * smiling but first let me * colonel darke recognize you you mean know me oh yes sir and did he speak of his former * his wife no sir and you * smiled i made out i * remember him sir i was afraid he would think i had * that talk with his wife so he simply called as if to see you as a curiosity yes * * only a few minutes but you know or rather knew poor swartz better i knew him well sir he often stopped here yes sir mohun looked at the woman * and said i wish you now to answer plainly the question which i am about to ask i come * as a * am sent by your friend mr nighthawk listen and answer * you know any thing of a paper which swartz had in his * important paper which he was * from colonel darke i do not sir said * with her eternal smile for that paper i will pay a thousand dollars in gold where is it the womans eyes * then she shook her head on my * i do not know sir can you discover again the shake of the head how can i sir * head sank a bitter sigh issued from his * a * listen he said almost * but with a singular smile you have * see things i do not believe in your * seem * only see where that paper is to be discovered and i will believe * more i will pay you the * which i mentioned this moment i looked at the woman to witness the result of this decisive * of her * if she * in her own * she will be * i said if she is an * she will be cast down she smiled * i will try sir she said mohun gazed at her * when shall i come to hear the result in ten days from this time sir in ten days so be it and rising mohun bade the singular * farewell and went toward his horse i followed and we rode back rapidly in dead silence toward the * mohun rode on for more than a mile at full gallop without * a word then he turned his head and said with a sigh well what do you think of your new acquaintance surry i think she is an * as to her * you mean yes her story of darke i believe to be true and i know it returned mohun a strange discovery is it not i went there today without * of this nighthawk informed me that swartz had often been at the house of this * the paper which i wish to secure might have been left with her for safe * thus i determined to go and * out the matter in a personal interview i have done so pretty thoroughly and it seems plain that she knows nothing of its present * will she discover through her * * her strange * exhibited in the * of our persons i know not and so that matter * i have failed and yet have learned some singular facts can you believe that strange story of darke is he not a * * this narrative we have just heard * the * touch to his * * * the daughter of his victim it is truly an extraordinary history altogether i said and the whole life of this man is now known to me with a single * ah you mean the period when you fought with him and ran him through the body and threw him into that grave from which swartz afterward * him on the morning of the 13th december # mohun looked at me with that clear and * glance which * him ah you know that he said i could not fail to know it mohun * to think that all this time you have perhaps regarded me as a * surry but i am * is i * * if not in * yes my dear friend mohun added with a deep sigh his head * upon his breast there was a day in my life when i was * a simple * on that day i attempted to * murder and * you have * come to catch many * of those past horrors on the rappahannock the words of that woman must have startled you in the wilderness my * with the spy revealed more * the words of darke on the night of * murder must have * * me in this issue of horrors i knew that you must know much and i did not * before you surry do you know why because i have * friend and thank god my evil * did not result as i intended in murder and * mohun passed his hand across his forehead to * away the * of cold * all this is gloomy and tragic he said and yet i must * it on you surry even more i earnestly long to tell you the whole story of which you have caught these * will you listen it will not be long i wish to show you my dear * are that to me * i am not * of your regard that there are no * scenes at least in my past life that i have not * * * if i have attempted to destroy myself and others will you listen i have been waiting long to do so mohun i said speak but first hear me there is a man in this army who is the soul of honor since my fathers death i value his good opinion more than that of all * is robert e lee well come with me if you choose and i will go to lee with you and place my hand upon your shoulder and say general this is my friend i * for him i am proud of his regard think well of him or * of me too are you satisfied mohun smiled sadly i knew all that he said do you think i can not read men surry long since i gave you in my heart the name of friend and i knew that you had done as much toward me come then go to my camp with me in the evening we will take a ride i am going to conduct you to a spot where we can talk without * the * place where the * of which i shall speak were committed and * the gallop mohun led the way amid the * * through the fallen * across the * half an hour afterward we had reached his camp as the sun began to * we again mounted our horses * on rapidly we reached a large house on a hill above the * and entered the tall * at the moment when the great windows were all * in the sunset mohun * up the hill * in his horse in front of the great * and * fastened his * to the * of a magnificent * one of a hundred which were scattered over the * grounds i * him and we entered the house together through the door which gave way at the first * no one had come to take our horses no one opposed our entrance the house was evidently deserted i looked round in astonishment and admiration in every thing * to the mansion were the * of almost * wealth directed by the * and most * taste the broken furniture was heavy and * * the * of * of * velvet the walls * * and deep windows were one mass of the * * and most * * on the walls still hung some * * in the most * * on the * of * marble supported by * * with * * * rested a full length picture of a gentleman the heavy * frame * and * the house was desolate deserted * * from the evident * between its present and its past but about the grand mansion hung an august air of * * which to me was more striking than if i had visited it in the days of its glory let me * * to you or rather the remains of it surry mohun said with a sad smile it is not pleasant to bring a friend to so deserted a place but i have long been absent the house is gone to * like other things in old virginia still we can probably find two * i will * a * and we can light a cigar and talk without * with these words mohun proceeded to the * apartment from which he returned a moment afterward * two * with * * * see he said with a smile they were handsome once that one with the ragged * of red velvet was my fathers take a seat my dear surry i will sit in the * was my mothers returning to the * room mohun again * this time bearing in his arms the broken * of a * table which he * up in the great * this is all that remains of our old family * he said some yankee or * soldier will probably use it for this * i * them and * * beneath the * mohun had * to the * * case which he always carried with him in order to read * * the * and a * * up next he produced his cigar case offered me an excellent * which i accepted and a minute afterward we were leaning back in the great * * an * welcome this said mohun with his sad smile broken * old pictures and a fire made of * furniture but one thing we * * opportunity to * let us talk therefore or rather i will at once tell you what i promised mohun leaned back in his chair * for a moment with evident * and then with a deep sigh said i am about to * to you my dear surry a history so singular that it is probable you will think i am * my fancy in certain * of it that would be an * it is a true life i am about to lay before * i need not add that * * are often more * than any due to the imagination of the * writer i once knew a celebrated * and one day * to him the curious history of a family in virginia make a * of that i said it is an * history but my friend shook his head it will not answer my purpose he replied smiling it is too strange and the * would call me a * * is ruin me and he was right surry it is only to a friend on some occasion like the present that i could tell my own story it is too singular to be believed otherwise but i am * let me proceed my family is an old one they tell me in this part of virginia and my father whose portrait you see before you on the * was what is called an * that is to say he was a gentleman of * * and * fond of books a great * of fine * and a gentleman of social * and feelings * old * been for many * the scene of a * * my father kept up the ancient * * all * and when i grew to * i * * the feelings and clung to the * of the family these * may be * up in the * which my father taught * * be * to high and low alike assist the poor * the unhappy give * without * and enjoy the * heaven * you with a clear conscience whether you are called an * or a * such were my fathers * and he * them for he had the * and * heart in the world he was * in all by my mother a perfect * upon earth and if i have since that time given way to rude * it was not for * a good example in the * lives of this true gentleman and pure * * i did not have their example long when i was * my mother died and my father as though unable to live without her who had so long been his blessing followed her a year afterward leaving me the sole * of the great * of the family for a time grief crushed me i was * i had neither brother nor * solitary youth in this great lonely house standing * amid its twenty thousand * even the * who had been appointed to look after my affairs * came to see me and relieve my * the only * i had was a sort of * or * * know him and his * for me it was * * my father had loved and trusted his relieved the * of the humble family once when they were about to be turned * for * the * nighthawk then * a profound affection for his * dying left to his son the * to watch over and serve faithfully the son of his old master do not laugh at that word surry it is the old english term and england is best of all i think so nighthawk came to live with me and take care of my interests you know that he has continued to be faithful and to serve me and love me to this moment but in spite of the presence of this true friend i was still lonely i * life movement * this i promised myself to secure at the * of virginia to which i accordingly went * there the greater portion of my time until i had reached the age of twenty then i returned to * to find however that the spot was more dreary than before i was the master of a great estate but alone lord of myself i found like the unhappy * * and randolph of * after him that it was a * of * there was little or no society in the * least * to my * lived a solitary * * existence and events soon proved that this life had prepared my character for some violent * a * could have * that every thing in * * on * the * may * long but the moment he * spirit an * * men love because the time and a woman have * that hour and person came all at once to * me from my * one day i was * * * in my movements * of all things and all persons around me on the next i was aroused excited with every * and * * i was becoming suddenly * and soon the * of love had absorbed all the powers of my being you know who aroused that * the daughter of george conway at that time she was called miss * the * of our acquaintance was singular fate seemed to have * that all connected with our relations should be * one night i was returning at full speed from the house of a gentleman in the neighborhood * i had been to make a visit the night was as dark as a * mouth and a violent storm rushed down upon me when i was still many miles from home i have scarcely ever witnessed a more furious * the thunder and * were fearful and i pushed my horse to his * speed to reach * before the * of rain * me to the * well i had entered the * woods a mile or two from the house and was * at full speed through the black darkness which the * only occasionally * now when all at once my horse struck his * against something i heard a cry and then a * * showed me a light carriage which had evidently just been * i was nearly * by the * but leaped to the ground and at the same moment another * showed me the form of a lady whom a man was * from the broken * i hastened to render my assistance the lady was lifted in our arms and then i * in raising the fallen horse who lay on his side frightened and * * ten minutes afterward i was placed in possession of what the * call the facts of the case mr * of georgia was * home from the north with his sick sister in his carriage for the benefit of her health they had lost their way the storm had caught them their carriage had * in the * could mr * obtain * for the night the condition of his sister rendered it * that they should not continue their journey until morning even if the storm and broken * permitted i listened and felt a warm sympathy for the poor sick * was only a girl of eighteen and very beautiful i would gladly have offered my own house but it was still some miles distant and the young woman was so weak and trembled so * that it would plainly be impossible to conduct her so far on foot true my carriage might have been sent for her but the rain was now * in * before it arrived she would be * else must be thought of all at once the idea occurred to me * hopes is only a quarter of a mile distant mr hope was the * of the * and a most excellent man i at once suggested to mr * that his sister should be conducted * and as he * at once we half conducted half carried the poor girl through the woods to the humble * of the * the good * received us in a manner which showed his * that to * the stranger or the unfortunate is often to * * * it is true that on this occasion it was something like a * of * whom he received into his mansion the young lady threw herself into a seat seemed to suffer much and was soon conducted by the * old * he was a * * her chamber in which a fire had been quickly * she disappeared * * but in those few minutes i had taken a good look at her you have seen her and i need not describe her she is still of great beauty but at that time she was a wonder of * slender graceful with a figure * * with * lips as * as an * grand dark eyes which seemed to burn with an * light as she looked at you such was miss * at eighteen when i first saw her on that night in the * woods an hour after the scene which i have tried to describe i was at home and seated in this apartment then very different in appearance * deeply upon this * * with the beautiful girl it was midnight before i retired i fell asleep thinking of her and the exquisite face still followed me in my dreams these few words tell you much do they not surry you no doubt begin to understand now when i have scarcely begun the real narrative what is going to be the character of the * were i a * writer i should call your attention to the fact that i have introduced my characters described their appearance and given you an * of the * of events which are about to be * before you a young man of twenty is * to your attention a youth living in a great mansion lord of himself but tired of * that authority of violent * but without an object and at that very moment * appeared a lovely girl with dark eyes * lips whom the youth * and * under most * circumstances well the lord of himself * in real life as he would have done in a * in other words my dear surry i proceeded * to fall * in love with miss * and it is * to say that on the next day my horse might have been seen standing at the * of the parsonage i had gone you see as * required to ask how the young lady felt after her accident she was leaning back in an * reading a good book and looked charming the accident seemed to have greatly * the delicate frame of the young creature but when i entered she held out her hand * me with a * smile * was * by * i mean mr * i did not fancy the countenance of that gentleman much it was dark and * but his * were those of a person * with good society he * me with * as the french say for my * assistance on the night before and then he * forth with the good * to look at the garden leaving me * with his sister why * out my story by comment * a description of every scene and the * steps through which the affair passed i was in love with miss * she saw it her eyes said love me as much as you choose and dont be afraid i will not love you soon in return at the end of this interview which the worthy mr * did not * for at least two hours i rode home thinking with a * of the heart if she will only love me then the * was succeeded by a sudden * of the same * but there will be no opportunity i * doubtless in two or three days she will leave this part of the country a week afterward that * had been completely removed miss * was still faint and weak from her accident all her movements were slow and * she had not left the good * house * what is more she was not going to leave it she had learned what she desired to know about me heard that i was a young man of great wealth and had * a scheme so singular * let me not * she proceeded rapidly in our second interview she made eyes at me in the third she * and * * my * when i looked at her in the fourth she * more deeply when i took her * did not withdraw it in the fifth the fair head in some manner had come to rest on my * doubt from * and in a few days afterward the * * loving * creature * deeply * upon my bosom as the * say and * how can i resist you in other words my dear friend miss * had promised to become my wife and i need not say i was the * of men i thought with * of the * i was about to enjoy in having by my side throughout life this charming creature i trembled at the very thought that the accident in the wood might not have happened and i might never have known her i was at the parsonage morning noon and night when not beside her i was riding through the forest at full speed with * brow laughing lips and * of * a word my dear friend i was as much * as ever youth was yet and * on * and * to an extent that was really * there was absolutely nothing to * our marriage my old * it is true shook his head and suggested * into the family position character etc of the * i was young * * of one of the * families he said and * might * me but all i heard was the word * i left my * whose * had ceased now in high * at his * * that angel a * that pure devoted creature * of * i fell into a rage * never to visit my * again and returning to the parsonage urged a * * of our marriage the fair one was not * she indicated that fact by * * me at first but soon yielded when i rode home that night i had made every * for our union in one month from that time so much for act i surry mohun had commenced his narrative in a * voice and with an expression of great * upon his features as he proceeded however this all disappeared gradually the voice became * and * so to describe it and his face resumed that expression of * bitterness which i had observed in him on our first meeting as he returned thus to the past all its bitterness seemed to * memory * him with its * * and mohun had gone back to his first * of the man stern * and * after * the words so much for act i surry he paused a moment afterward however he resumed his narrative what i am now going to tell you is not agreeable to remember my dear surry and i shall accordingly * every thing as * as possible i * only to give you a clear * of the tragedy you will form your own opinion i was * enough in * miss * to you at the parsonage to describe that young lady as a devil no doubt the term * you and yet it * something very like the * truth i * to you that this woman was and is still a * to me a most curious study how could she be such as she was she had the lips of an * and the eyes of an angel was it not strange that under all that she should * the heart of a born devil but to continue my narrative the month or two which * between my engagement and my marriage was not an * dream of * the atmosphere was * * on more than one occasion * was frequently absent from the parsonage when i arrived taking long * with * her brother and when she returned from these * i could see a very strange expression on her countenance as she looked at me occasionally her glance was like those * * of * which you may have seen issue from the * of a black cloud her black eyes were the * the * i assure you their expression at such moments was far from agreeable what to make of it i knew not i am not * * but on more than one occasion i felt a strange * * of the heart when i encountered those * * saw my * and hastened at once to * and * it the dark * was always succeeded by the most brilliant sunshine but even in moments of her greatest * * i would still meet suddenly when she did not think i was looking at her the * glance which * me in spite of this strange * however the young girl possessed * influence over me i could not resist her * and was as * in her hands she took a charming interest in all that * me painted the * future before us in all the colors of the * and declared that the devotion of her whole life would not be sufficient to * her gratitude for my * in wedding a poor girl who had nothing but her warm love to offer me that is more than enough i said * by her * voice i have few relations and * are all to me and you to me she said then she added with a sort of * but suppose you were to die i laughed and replied you would be well provided for and find yourself a gay young widow with * of * she looked at me * do you think i would ever marry again she said no i would take our marriage ring and some little * connected with you leave your fine house and go with my brother to some poor home in a foreign country where the memory of our past happiness would be my * i shook my head you will not do that i said you will be the mistress of all my fortune after my death oh no she exclaimed oh yes i * laughing and to make every thing certain i am going to draw up my will this very day leaving you every thing which i possess in the world her face suddenly flushed how can you think of such a thing she said i did not know how much you loved me you will understand my dear surry that those words did not change my resolution when i left her i went home and wrote the will in due form and on my next visit she asked laughing if i had carried out my * resolution yes i said and now let us talk of a more interesting * marriage she * then turned pale and again i saw the strange * glance it disappeared however in an instant and she was all smiles and * throughout the remainder of the day never had i been so happy as the day of our marriage approached continued mohun i saw more than once the same singular expression in the * eyes and i confess it * me she seemed to be the * to singular * and * of silence she took more * and longer * with * than before when they returned from these * and found me awaiting them at the parsonage both would look at me in the * way only to quickly withdraw their eyes when they caught my own fixed upon them i * to speak of this curious * to some one but had no friend my best friend nighthawk was * from me and * had been the cause from the first moment of our acquaintance nighthawk had seemed to * something he did not attempt to * his * of * and the young lady why was that i could not tell your dog * when the secret foe * you smiling and perhaps nighthawk my faithful * had something of the watch dog in him certain it is that he had witnessed my growing * with miss * with * * as i became more and more * he became almost * toward me when i asked him the meaning of his singular * he shook his * then with flushed cheeks and eyes exclaimed do not marry this young person sir something bad will come of it when he said that i looked at him with * * this sentiment changed in a few moments to cold * leave this house i said and do not return until you have learned how to * me with * respect he looked at me for a moment clasped his hands opened his * about to burst forth into passionate * all at once * his head went out in silence i looked after him with a strange * of the heart what could he mean he was * i mounted my horse * to the parsonage was received with radiant smiles and forgot the whole scene on the next day nighthawk did not * on the next i did not see him again until the evening of the day on which i was married to that * moment i have now conducted you my dear surry the morning for my marriage came i say the * my * as the * * say had declared that she * the idea of being married at night she also * to * i not consent to have the ceremony performed quietly at the parsonage with no one present but her brother and the excellent * hope and his old * then she would belong to * could do as i pleased with * her to * or where i * only begged that i would allow her to * on the ocean of * with no one to witness her * but myself her brother the old * and the good minister i * at once the speech * me i need not * i was not myself * to * with * eyes and laughing * * as i was i could not * from myself that my marriage was a * and * * affair i * whether the old friends of my father in the neighborhood would * of it and now when * gave me a good excuse to * with their presence i gladly * invited no one and went to my wedding alone in the great family * * by a single friend or * * met me with a radiant smile and her wedding dress of white silk made her look perfectly charming her lips were * her eyes * but all at once as she looked at me i saw the color all * out of the * lips of the lady and from the great dark eyes * the * * a * like that of death * me i know not why but i * my emotion in ten minutes i was standing before the excellent * the young * cold hand in * we were * declared man and wife all my * and strange * were completely * at this instant i was * with happiness and would not have * a king upon his * with the hand of the lovely creature in my own and her eyes fixed upon me with an expression of the * love i * but one * of full complete * happiness let me * on the storm is coming my dear surry i * on the * of the tragedy and * even now with a sort of * from the terrible scenes which succeeded my marriage tragedy is a * word as you will * for the * it was going to * * preserve the * * with * * half an hour after the ceremony i led madam to my * followed her into the * and making a last sign of * to the good * directed the * to proceed to * * excellent brother did not accompany us he declared his intention to remain on that night at the parsonage he would call at * on the next * the day after he proposed to continue his way to georgia his eyes were not a pleasant spectacle as he uttered these words and i observed a singular * came to * countenance but i was in no * to * * at the height of happiness i looked * down upon all the world and with the hand of my wife in my own was driven rapidly to * we arrived in the afternoon and * in state all alone madam did the * of her table with exquisite grace but more than once i saw her hand shake in a very singular way as she carried food or a glass to her lips after dinner she bade me a smiling courtesy leaving me to find company in my cigar she said and * off to her chamber well i * my cigar retired to the library and * myself in an * before the fire began to * it was nearly the middle of december and through the opening in the * i could see the moonlight on the * * of the lawn i had just taken my seat when i heard a step in the passage the door of the library opened and nighthawk as pale as a * and with a strange expression in his eyes entered the apartment i had recognized his step continued mohun but i did not move or turn my head for i had not recovered from my feeling of ill * toward the faithful * i allowed him to approach me and then said * without looking at him who is that i sir said nighthawk in a trembling voice what do you want i wish to speak to you sir i am not at * i must speak to you sir i * round in my chair and looked at him his * was * what does all this mean i said * this is a singular * i would not * upon you if it was not necessary sir he said in an * voice but i must speak to you tonight there was something in his * which frightened me i knew not why well speak i said * but be brief as brief as i can sir but i must tell you all if you strike me dead at your feet i must tell you all sir in spite of myself i * speak i said what does this mean nighthawk why do you look like a * at me he came up close to me what i have to tell you * your honor and your life sir he said in a low tone i gazed at him in * astonishment was i the * of some * i * to you surry i thought for a moment that i was * all this a * ran through my frame i placed my hand upon my heart which felt * * suddenly my * and * seemed to return to me as by * explain your words i said * there is some * in them which i do not understand speak and speak plainly i will do so sir he replied in the same trembling voice and going to the door of the apartment he bent down and placed his ear at the * he remained in this * for a moment without moving then rising he went to the window and drawing aside the * looked out on the * * * this second examination seemed to * him at the same instant a light * step of * heard crossing the floor of the apartment above our heads and this evidently * * last * he returned quickly to the seat where i was sitting looked at me for some minutes with eyes full of fear affection sympathy * and said in a voice so low that it * rose above a * we are alone sir and i can speak without being * by these * who have * and are about to murder you do not * me * time is * must know every thing at once in an hour it would be too late the man calling himself * is probably within a hundred yards of us at this moment the woman you have married * wife stop * not strike * i know the truth of every thing now she talked with him for an hour under the big * near the parsonage last night he will see her again tonight and in this * me to the end sir you will not * him you will care nothing for all this you will not know it for you will be dead sir at these words i must have turned deadly pale for nighthawk hastened to my side and placed his arm around me to support me but i did not need his assistance in an instant i was as calm as i am at this moment i quietly removed the arm of nighthawk and said in a low tone how do you know this i * their talk he replied in a * voice and looked at me with * tenderness as he spoke i was coming to see you at the parsonage where i thought you had gone sir i could not bear to keep away from my old * son any longer and let him get married without making up and having him feel kindly again to me well sir i had just reached the big * when i saw the lady come out of the house * toward the * and * herself in the shadow within a few feet of me no sooner had she done so than i saw a man come from the rear of the house straight to the * and as he drew nearer i recognized * madam * slightly as though to give him the signal he soon reached her and then they began to talk i was hidden by the trunk of the tree and the shadow of the heavy * reaching nearly to the ground so i heard every word they said without being discovered what was it they said i can not repeat their words sir but i can tell you what i learned from their talk tell me i said first i discovered that madam had been married to that man more than a year before you saw her yes before which she had been tried * and confined for six months in a prison in new york as a * you turn pale sir shall i stop no go on i said these facts continued nighthawk came out in a sort of * which madam had with the man he * her with * to * * loving * said he had not * her from misery to be thus treated she laughed and replied that she was only following a suggestion of his own they were poor they must live he had himself said that they must * money either * or * and he had fully * of the plan she had now * you * * an * * idea of her loving you was * you were * * * had made a will leaving her your entire * you died suddenly on your wedding night she and himself would possess * and live in * go on i said at these words continued nighthawk i could see the man turn pale he had not intended that he said his scheme had been that madam should * you to * upon her a splendid * in the * of * and money with which they would * the marriage was only a * he * did not wish to turn it into a tragedy but she interrupted him * and said she * and would have no mercy on you she would have all or nothing your will made her the mistress what was a crime more or less to people like themselves at these words he uttered a * in a word she added you were an * and she was going to * * or without his consent she then proceeded to tell him her resolution and it is a * a horrible one sir all is * are about to be * how and when i said this very night by * ah i said explain that madam has provided herself with * which she will place in the tea you drink tonight tea will be served in half an hour he will be * she forced him to * your * will * all to him you

and come up the back * madam will open the private door for him to come in and take a look at your body do you understand now sir yes i said remain here nighthawk there is the step of the servant coming to tell me tea is ready the door opened as i uttered the words and my old * * and an * so to say of the * low and announced that tea was served and madam waiting i rose and looked into the * above the * i was pale but not sufficiently so to * * and with a smile which frightened nighthawk took my way toward the * madam was awaiting me as i * and i had never seen her look more radiant a single glance told me that she had made an * * in honor * funeral her dark hair was in shining * her eyes * with joy her parted lips showed her white * only evidence i saw of concealed emotion was in the * cheeks they were as white as the lace falling over her * silk dress you see you keep me waiting she said with * * and your tea is growing cold * is worse for me than for you as you do not care but i care for you and as i passed her she drew me * toward her dragged me down and held up her lips i touched them with my own they were as cold as * or the cheek my own face just touched in passing i went to the table took my seat and madam poured out the tea with a * glance toward me i was not looking at her but i saw it a moment afterward the old * presented me the small * cup * * and * i took it looking as before out of the corner of my eye at madam she was leaning forward watching me with a face as pale as death i could hear her teeth * i placed the cup to my * hand holding a * trembled so that the * beat a * on her * she was watching me in * * and all at once i turned full toward her the taste of this tea is singular i said i should call it very bad oh it * she * between her * teeth the cup you send me is certainly wretched do me the pleasure to taste it madam and * it upon the * of the old servant i said take this to your mistress he did so she just touched it with her lips her

the * * for five * in that time i had formed my resolution * was first to be thought of i intended to put him to death first and * it would have been easy to have * the old * of the * age and ordered

spot far distant from this * without * * fair fight with me no one even seeing us i had formed this resolution in five minutes after the departure of madam from the * i went straight to the library * stated my resolution to nighthawk and in spite of his most obstinate * and repeated * broke down his opposition by * force of will it took me half an hour but at the end of that time i had succeeded nighthawk listened with bent head and pale face covered with * of cold * to my orders these orders were to have the horses put to the carriage which was to be ready at my call then to proceed with a * servant or more if necessary to a private spot on the river which i described to him * a grave of full length and * and when his work was finished return and report the fact to me * the servant or

with a sort of curiosity i saw that he was a man of * courage and that the * of a gentleman had not entirely left him * as he was with every crime his eye was calm and * he did not move an * when i placed my pistol * upon his breast at the words which i uttered he withdrew his hand from his * had returned the * to its * with a * glance said what do you wish sir as you * you * me ask madam i said

you see i talk to you plainly sir i know a gentleman when i see him and you are one i was formerly something of the same sort but having * myself went on in the career that brought me to this i was * poor now i * the idea of this * with a view to * by it but with no further he suddenly paused and looked at the woman their * in that moment crossed like * speak out she cried say plainly hush i did not mean * am no * madam say plainly that it was i who formed the design to get * of this person and she pointed * at me let no * * * nothing upon * was i * who * his death * remained for an instant

of * so be it he said and i am ready to accompany you sir i drew my pistol and threw it upon the bed looking at * as i did so he * me and opening his coat showed me that he was * * i did the same and having locked the private door leading to the back * led the way out followed by * he turned and looked at madam as he passed through the door she was erect furious * full of anticipated triumph was it a glance of gloomy * and deep tenderness which * threw toward her i thought i heard him sigh i locked the door and we * to the library as we entered the apartment the * on the * struck midnight my body servant was within call and i ordered my carriage which nighthawk had been directed to have ready at a moments warning in five minutes it was at the door and i had just taken the two * under my arm when i heard a step in the passage a moment afterward nighthawk entered he was so pale that i scarcely recognized him when his eyes encountered * they flashed * of * well i said in brief tones it is ready sir nighthawk replied in a voice scarcely * i looked at him * and the servants are * to keep silent yes sir very well remain here until i return i said and i pointed to a seat with a glance at nighthawk which said plainly to him do not presume to attempt to turn me from my present * will be useless and * to me he * and sat down in the seat i indicated his frame was bent and * like that of an old man in one evening since that moment i have loved nighthawk my dear surry and he * it without delay i led the way to the carriage which was driven by my fathers old * * and entered it with * * the * to follow the * down the river he did so we rolled on in the moonlight or the shadow as it came forth or disappeared behind the * clouds the air was * cold from beyond the woods came the * roar of the * which was * by a * * drew his * around him but said nothing in ten minutes i called to the old * to stop he * his * * had some good ones * i * from the carriage with the * under my arm followed by * the old * looked on in astonishment the spot at which i had stopped the carriage was wild and dreary beyond expression shall i wait sir he said * no return home at once and put away the carriage he looked at me with a sort of * go home sir he said yes and leave you obey me my voice must have shown that * would be useless my old * uttered a sigh like the * which had escaped from the lips of nighthawk and * the box turned the heads of his horses toward home i watched the carriage until it turned a * in the road and then making a sign to * to follow me led the way into the woods * a path which the moonlight just enabled me to * i * the forest went on for about ten minutes and finally * upon a * in the * * near which stood the * of an old * this * had served to indicate the spot to nighthawk and before us in the moonlight was the evidence that he had found it in the centre of the * was a * * * in front of it i paused we have arrived i said * gazed at the grave with a grim smile that is a dreary and desolate object he said it will soon be * i returned and the issue of this combat is * to me since in either event i shall be dead ah he exclaimed explain that then you do not understand you think this * will end every thing you * yourself a family history like mine does not * with a * have you read those * where everybody is * not a single one of the * * * well this is going to be a * of that * description do you wish to save that woman yonder to do so you must kill me i tell you that to * you to do your best sir * * at me it is hard to imagine a glance more * so you have arranged the whole affair he said there is to be a * * yes you are going to * yes yourself too yes * smile became more * as he raised his * take your position sir he said i am going to save you the latter trouble i * my * and placed myself on guard in an instant he had thrown himself upon me with a fury which indicated the profound * under his assumed * his eyes * his lips * into something like a deadly * i felt that i had to * rather with a wild animal than a man the grave * in the moonlight at our very feet and * closed in with fury * to force me to its * and * me into it ten minutes afterward the combat was over and it was * who occupied the grave he had given ground an instant to * had returned to the attack more * than before a tremendous blow of his * * my own eighteen * from the * but this had probably saved my life instead of * it as * from his fierce * as the * broke evidently expected before he could take advantage of his success i sprang at his throat * his * with my left hand and * my * of a * drove the point through his breast he uttered a cry * and threw up his hands i * my * on his arm and he fell heavily * into the grave now to end all i said and i set out rapidly for * i had not gone a hundred yards when i heard the sound of * approaching i had said to myself i am going back to madam she will hear my * upon the * will open the door will rush forward to * me under the impression that i am her dear * returning * from the field of battle and then a grand * things were destined to turn out * as you will see in an instant the sound of * grew * a carriage appeared and i recognized my own * why have you * my orders i said to the old * * * the horses as i spoke by * * the * the old * looked frightened then he said in an * voice madam ordered me to obey her sir madam yes sir where is she in the carriage sir as soon as i got back she came down to the * me to drive her to * i was obliged to do so sir good i said you have done well and opening the door of the carriage through the glass of which i saw the pale face of the woman i entered it * the * to drive to the * crossing a * but * voice at my side said where is mr * gone over the river i said laughing and we are going too to * him yes madam the carriage had rolled on and as it passed the grave i heard a * what is that said she the river is * over yonder madam you will not attempt to pass it tonight yes madam are you afraid she looked at me with fiery eyes afraid no she said i am afraid of nothing i really * her at that moment she was truly brave i said nothing however the carriage rolled on and ten minutes afterward the roar of the river now near at hand was heard that sound mingled with the deep * of the thunder which succeeded the * * at every instant * the darkness all at once my companion said i am tired of * is mr * he * us i replied you are going to him yes we had reached the bank of the river and * the carriage i * out madam followed me without being invited a small boat rose and fell on the * * i * the * seized a * and pointed to the stern seat the river is dangerous tonight said madam * then you are afraid after all no she said and with a firm step she entered the boat go back with the carriage i said to the * he turned the heads of the horses and * in silence madam had taken her seat in the stern of the boat i pushed from shore into the * and * rapidly to the middle of the * * filled with * threw the * * and took my seat in the stern as i threw away the * my resolution seemed to dawn for the first time upon my companion she had become deadly pale but said nothing with folded arms i looked and listened we were * a narrow and * point in the river where there was no hope the * boat was going to be * there or dashed to pieces without mercy i knew the * that there was no hope the * was * and driving the boat like a * toward the * and fatal * then you are going to kill me and yourself at the same time she said the woman was * yes i said it is the only way i could not live * * * * die with you and i rose erect * my forehead to the * the point was reached the boat swept on with the speed of a * a * * showed a dark object amid the * right ahead of us the boat rushed toward * * teeth seemed * at * boat * the next moment i felt the * * over me * furious and * like a wild * that has caught its * when i opened my eyes the sun was shining in my face i was lying on a mass of * caught by a * of rock * out into the river i had apparently been * there by the force of the * * and * the sunshine had aroused me bringing me back to that life which was a burden and a * and where was she i * as i asked myself that question had she been thrown from the boat had it been * was she * i closed my eyes with a * which * my body * my blood as with the cold hand of death for a moment i thought of throwing myself into the river and thus * all my * but i was too * i turned toward the shore * dragged my * and * * along the * of * * through the * of * and finally reached the shore where i sank down exhausted and ready to die i will not * out the gloomy picture at last i rose looked around and with bent head and * frame stole away through the woods toward * on my way i passed within two hundred yards of the * i dared not go * he was dead * he had been * in fair combat it was another form that * * form of a * who had * * to * * terrible * still a woman and i * her i reached home an hour or two afterward nighthawk was sitting in the library pale and * watching for me as i entered he rose with an * extending his arms toward me with an * expression of joy i * back * his hand do not touch that i * there is blood on it he seized it and * down kissed it bloody or not it is your * hand of my dear young master and the honest

throughout the earlier * of his narrative in a tone of * bitterness his last words were mingled however with weary * and his face wore an expression of the * melancholy the * cigar had fallen from his fingers to the floor he leaned back * in his great * with eyes fixed upon the dying fire he seemed to go back in memory to the terrible scenes just described living over again all those * and * * so it ended surry he said after a long pause such was the * * into which the devil and my own * pushed me in that month of december # a hand as * and * as the * necessity had led me step by step to * * if not in * for years the shadow of the crime which i believed i had committed made my life wretched i * over europe * into a thousand scenes of * and * was all * the shadow went with me crime is a terrible companion to have ever at your * the * * of the poet is nothing to it friend it is a * which will not be driven away it * and * and * its * day and night believe me * speak from * is better for this world as well as the next to be a * a * a * with a clear conscience than to hold in your hand the means of all * and * * and with it the consciousness that you are blood * under almost any circumstances some men might have * comfort from the circumstances of that crime i could not they might have said i was * * driven * * beyond my strength caught in a * of fire from which there was but one * of * burst out * down every thing four words * all that * was a woman it was the face of that woman as i saw it last on that * night by the * * which drove me to despair i the son of the pure

manner i had * him in fair combat body to * however the law of god may * * there was still that * difference i had played my life against his as it * had lost and he paid the * but the other was * that fact * me in the face she had * me * me attempted to * and then * me she had * to murder me and had set about her design * * without * * by the * of gold only she * * * was a woman i had not said

brigade of general lees cavalry you saw me then and remember my bitterness and melancholy but you had no opportunity to * the * and * of those * in me suddenly the * was lifted that woman made her appearance as if from the grave and you must have witnessed my wonder as my eyes fell upon her then she was not dead after all i was not a * and to complete the wonder he was also alive a man passing along the bank of the river as i discovered afterward from nighthawk who * out the whole * man named swartz a sort of poor * and * passing along the * on the morning after the storm had found the woman cast * with the boat * near her and a mile farther had found * not yet dead in the grave * by swartz they had both * then disappeared i was to meet them again and know of their existence only

government steadily at * do you know my dear colonel i am in * today i am certain to receive my appointment at last as brigadiergeneral look out or * be mistaken said a * voice behind us and mr * * a

but all would be well if we could * * and bring out our strength a * however seems * us the * * the country of the little gold which is left in it the * run up * and * the * beyond hope the * and * men who ought to be in the army * in the streets and the bitter * of the president * the public mind and * into it despair it is this colonel not our * which is going to ruin us if we are * on the night before my return to the army i paid my last visit to john m * shall i show you a great career * a mighty ship run upon the * the * of our narrative * us toward passionate and tragic events but toward few scenes more * than that which i witnessed on this night in december 1864 i found john m * in his house on broad street as before * still in his high chair of black * all alone his face was * his cheeks more * and now * and * his eyes * with gloomy fire as he half * beneath the * of * * * from the * and * the whole apartment with their brilliant * of his * he received me with grim * offered me a cigar and said i am glad to see you colonel and to offer you one of the last of my * of * * is going * goodbye to * * you believe * is going to fall then as surely as savannah savannah you think that we are more * at petersburg * or not colonel i am certain of what i say remember my * when it is * the yankees are a * people they take * and win gettysburg on their great national * and now they are going to present themselves with a handsome christmas * is the city of savannah he spoke with evident difficulty and his * voice like his * cheeks showed that he had been ill since i last saw him savannah captured or surrendered i said with * * what will be the result of that ruin was the * * not the loss of a mere town no the place itself is nothing for sherman to take it will not benefit him much but it will prove to the country and the president that he is * then they will * and you will see the beginning of the end that is a gloomy view enough * thing is gloomy now the devil of * * and * * affairs i do not * in the * * but we are going straight to the devil as he uttered these words he placed his hand upon his breast and closed his eyes as though he were going to faint what is the matter i exclaimed rising * and approaching him nothing he replied in a weak voice dont * yourself about me these * of * come on now and then in consequence of an attack of * which i had * sit down colonel you must really pardon me for saying it but you make me nervous there was nothing in the tone of this singular address to take * * voice of the * was perfectly * i resumed my seat we were talking about sherman he said they call him * * * i know not what in the * * of this city his lip * as he spoke one * * * declared the other day that god had put a * in * nose and was leading him to his destruction i dont think it looks much like it the * was stopped by a fit of * and when it had * leaned back faint and exhausted in his chair the fact * he said with difficulty seems to * * * nose there was something grim and * in the smile which accompanied the * uttered words a long silence followed them which was broken by neither of us at last i raised my head and said i find you less * than last summer at that time you were in good spirits and the tone of the * was * it is * still he replied but by an * a sentiment of duty i often write far more * than i feel colonel your views have changed i * you change with the whole country yes a whole century has passed since last august when you visited me here one by one we have lost all that the country could * * goes last for myself i began to doubt when jackson fell at chancellorsville and i have been * more or less ever since he was a * man colonel fit if any thing happened to rise to the head of affairs oh for an hour of jackson oh for a day of our dead * the face of the * * and i shall never forget the * of his dark eye as he uttered the words if any thing happened there was a whole volume of * to president davis in those words but this is useless he went on jackson is dead and there is none to take his place so without leaders with every sort of * with * and * * the public * and * the acts of the administration we are * straight into the * of destruction i could make no reply the words of this singular man and profound * * me * yes colonel he went on the three or four months which have passed since your last visit have * away all * from my eyes at least and put an end to all my * others to that * which i spoke * * and * of the family estate of * it will never be restored by me like randolph i am the last of my line and with eyes full of a profound melancholy the * gazed into the fire i am passing away with the country he added the cause is going to fail i give it three months to end in and have sent for a prominent senator who may be able to do something i intend to say to him the time has come to make the best terms possible with the enemy and i shall place the columns of the * * at his * to * that policy is it possible i said * i do not think things are so desperate you are a soldier and * colonel the smoke * you and yet general lee is said to * * with * he is said to have * replied to a gentleman who advised them for myself i intend to die sword in hand general lee is a * you know what the song says a soldiers business boys is to die i could find no reply to the grim words i tell you the cause is lost colonel with * energy lost * at this moment while we are speaking it is lost from causes which are enough to make the devil laugh but it is lost all the same when the day of surrender and yankee * * the gentlemen of the south are placed under the * of negroes and * for one wish to die happy is the man who shall have * into the grave before that day blessed will be the woman who has never given * yes the best thing for me is to die and i am going to do so i shall not see that * * i shall be in my grave and * heavily the * again leaned back in his chair as though about to faint an hour afterward i * my visit and went out * and gloomy this singular man had made a * * of me to his own dark views the cloud which wrapped him now * * the black future i saw the * * already his * were destined to have a very remarkable * on the #* of december a few days after our interview sherman * to lincoln i beg to present you as a christmas * the city of savannah with one hundred and fifty guns and * of ammunition and also about twentyfive thousand * of cotton in january * fell toward the end of the same month john m * was a second time seized with * and took to his bed from which he was never again to rise he would see no one but his physician and a few chosen friends all other persons were * denied * to his chamber * throughout the remainder of the winter as spring approached life seemed gradually leaving him day by day his * grew * you would have said that this man was slowly dying with the cause for which he had fought that as the * * drop by drop from the * bosom of the southern confederacy the last * of john m * kept time to the * * one morning at the end of march his physician came to see him and found him lying on the * edge of his bed not * to * him the physician went to the window to * a * all at once a noise attracted his attention and he turned round the dying man had by a great effort turned completely over and lay on his back in the middle of the bed with his eyes closed and his arms folded on his breast as though he were praying when the physician came to his * he was dead it was four days before the fall of petersburg and richmond and he was buried in * just in time to escape the tramp of federal feet around his coffin his * and wish were thus * when i left mr john m * it was past ten at night and * to set out early in the morning for petersburg i bent my steps toward home the night was not however to pass without * of another character i was going along governor street * my way by the light of the few * set far apart and burning * when all at once i heard a cry in front succeeded by the noise of a * and then by a heavy fall * forward i reached the spot which was not far from the city hall and a glance told me all a * had been * that is to say suddenly attacked while passing along by one of the * who then * the streets after dark seized from behind * and thrown * to the * object of the * being * when i reached the spot the * was still * with his victim who stretched beneath him on the ground uttered * * one hand of the * was on his throat the other was * * his * i came up just in time to prevent a murder but not to * the * as i appeared he hastily rose * the throat of the unfortunate citizen i saw a watch * in his hand he * a violent * on his * * he disappeared running and was in an instant lost in the darkness i saw that pursuit would be useless and nobody ever thought at that period of * to * the * i turned to assist the victim who all at once rose from the ground * * and * the * shone upon his face it was the worthy mr * * * * of * mr * * his * hands and * all * things mr * * with loud * and * the assembled wisdom of the city fathers and the entire * force of the confederate capital to the * * i am * * the little * * in a * * which * the * of a furious old woman * * of every * money * had ten thousand dollars in gold and * on my * a confederate note in the whole * one gold and * * am * i will * the * i was going to my house like a quiet citizen i was * nobody and i am to be set on and * of my honest * by a * * * down my * picked my money * this in the capital of the confederacy under the nose of the * it was a * * which i * * * i could * * laughing as i looked at the little * with * hair * face torn clothes and * nose * * and * in agony over the loss of his honest * i * him in the best manner i could and asked him if he had lost every thing that question seemed to * him he felt hastily in his * then at the result my eyes opened wide * his hand into a secret pocket he drew forth an * roll of * and i could see the figures # on each of the notes as he ran over them that * alone must have contained several thousands of dollars but the worthy mr * did not seem in the least * he got the other * * the victim still in his wild * it was ten thousand * had just received it this * am * are going to murder * is the * i laid my hand upon his arm you have lost a very considerable * i said * may lose more still and i pointed to the roll of bank notes in his hand with a * glance at these words he started you are right colonel he said hastily i may be attacked again i may be * of * may finish me i will get home as quickly as i can thank you colonel you have saved me from * and murder come and see me colonel come and * with me my dear sir at five * and mr * commenced running * toward a place of safety in a moment he had disappeared and i found myself * * well i said as i walked on this is a charming * and * a * good idea of the city of richmond after dark in the year 1864 our friend * is * and * of his honest * at one fell * by a * the worthy citizen is * his * * his life * all the * of a life of * * have disappeared

or * those * were * they were never known to attack people with gray * knew better they attacked the black * in the * of which they * the presence of * and valuable papers never the gray * where they would find only a * leave of absence for their * i thus * the whole affair from my mind but it had aroused and excited me i did not feel at all * and finding by a glance at my watch beneath a lamp that it was only half past ten i resolved to go and ask after the health of my friend mr * whose house was only a square or two off this resolution i proceeded at once to carry out a short walk brought me to the house half buried in its * but as i approached i saw a carriage was standing before the house should i make my visit then or * it mr * evidently had company or had the carriage brought a visitor to some other member of the household mr * was only a * and i might be mistaken in * that he was engaged at the moment as these thoughts passed through my mind i approached the gate in the iron * the carriage was half hidden by the shadow of the * which grew in a * along the * on the box sat a * figure the * and * were as still and silent as if * out of * * i will discover i said and opening the gate i turned into the * path through the * which led toward the rear of the house that is to say toward the private entrance to the room of mr * suddenly as i passed through the * * i felt a hand on my shoulder i started back and * felt for some * dont * me colonel said a voice in the darkness i am a friend i recognized the voice of nighthawk good * my dear nighthawk i said drawing a long breath of relief you are enough to make * the brave himself * you turn up everywhere and especially in the dark what are you doing here i am watching colonel said nighthawk with * * watching and waiting waiting for whom for a lady with whom you have the honor of being * a lady that one you last saw in the lonely house near * neck hush here she comes his voice had * to a * and he drew me into the * as a long bar of light * from the door in the rear of the house ran out into the night i am going to follow her whispered nighthawk * his lips close to my ear she is at her * work here in richmond as swartz was suddenly he was silent a light step was heard a form approached us passed by i could see that it was a woman wrapped from head to foot in a gray * she passed so close to us that the * of her * nearly * our persons and disappeared toward the gate the iron * was heard to * the door of the carriage to open and close and then the * began to move nighthawk took two quick steps in the direction of the gate i am going to follow the carriage colonel he whispered i have been waiting here to do so i will tell you more another time give my * to general mohun and tell him i am on his business with which words nighthawk * into the * through the gate without sound from the * running * disappeared on the * of the carriage i gazed after him for a moment said to myself well this night is to be full of * going straight to the door in the rear of the house passed through it went to the door of mr * room and * come in said the voice of that gentleman and opening the door i entered mr * was seated in front of an excellent * fire in his great * near a table covered with papers and between his lips was the eternal cigar at sight of me he rose * he never * any form of * cordially shook my hand i am glad to see you colonel he said just from the army have a cigar and he extended toward me an * * full of * which he took from the table i declined * him that i had been * all the evening in the * of the editor of the * ah you have been to see * said mr * he is a very remarkable man i do not * of the course of his paper and he has attacked me very bitterly on more than one occasion but i bear no * against him he is honest in his opinions i * the * of the man and the splendid * of his * my views * with your own i replied everybody thinks with us said mr * * at his cigar it is only * who deny this mans courage and ability i have never done * to * i call that * in myself colonel he has * me alive on three or four occasions and it is not his fault that i am * this excellent * i read the * i said were they not fearful said mr * smiling * after reading them i regarded myself as a moral and political * i could not * from laughing as the * * uttered the words he seemed to * a * of * * from the * of his * i expect to talk over these little affairs with * * he said we shall have a great deal of time on our * * and mr * smiled and went on * it was the second time he had uttered that * * i laughed now and said you continue to regard * or * or * as your future residence yes i think i prefer * the view from * * is * and there is something english and * in the whole place which i like the * of * bring back the history of the * is more agreeable to me at least than the history of the present you * more than ever i see to your opinion that we are going to fail it is not an opinion my dear colonel but a * my head sank in the army i had been * when i came to richmond those high * john m * and mr * did not even attempt to * their gloomy views i see you think me a * said mr * * * and doubtless say to yourself colonel that i am * in thus * a soldier who is fighting for this cause a year ago i would not have spoken to you thus for a year ago there was still some hope now to * * thinking men fighting for a principle like yourself could be * result in no * for the cause is lost on the contrary as the friend of that most excellent gentleman your father i regard it as a sort of duty to speak * say to you dont throw away your life for nothing do your duty but do no more than your duty for we are * i could find no reply to these gloomy words the case is past praying for said mr * * the whole * of the confederacy at this moment is a mere shell it is going to * in the spring and another flag will * over the virginia capitol * you soldiers call the * the country is tired the administration is * and the * are * i am * you see the days of the confederacy are * and worse than all nobody knows it we ought to * for the best terms but the man who * that will be * at and called a * it is an * thing to do it is much * to * death sooner than surrender i * that * as long as there was any * i think it my duty as a * and public * to say there are worse things than * us try and avoid them by making terms i say that to * do not say so on the * people would * me to pieces and with their * of information they would be right in doing so is it possible that all is lost that * are our only hope yes and * * is a state secret my dear * will soon be made indeed you think that impossible but it is the impossible which * takes place in this world we are going to send commissioners to meet mr lincoln in hampton * it will be useless why we are going to demand such terms as he will not * to the commissioners will return the war will continue to its * military end which i * about the last days of march good heaven so soon yes in three months mr * * general lee may * the term a little by his skill and courage but it is not in his power even to resist beyond the month of april the army of northern virginia driven by the enemy forced to surrender or * and in * will never join johnston its numbers are too small to cut a path through the enemy grant will be at the * road before the first of april lee will * his lines which he will be compelled to hold to the last moment he will retreat be * be * down toward lynchburg and either surrender or be * cheerful * it it is * yes lees men are * now the country is tired of the war and * with the manner in which we * things no * are * the troops are not * but they are leaving the army without permission to * their * families lees last hours are approaching and we are playing the * here in richmond with an immense appearance of * * and * and laughing on the * of the * i play my part among the rest i risk my head more even perhaps than the military leaders i take a * view however of the present and future if i am not hung i will go to * meanwhile i smoke my cigar colonel and mr * * threw away his * and * a fresh * it is impossible to imagine any thing more * than his * this man was either very brave or * * five minutes afterward i knew that any thing but * possessed him all at once he rose in his chair and his eyes were fixed upon me with a glance so * and melancholy that they * still in my memory and will always * there i said we were playing a * here in richmond colonel he said in tones so deep and solemn that they made me start i am playing my part with the rest i play it in public and even in private as before you tonight i sit here * * and * my * and * and at the moment that i am speaking my heart is breaking i am a * love this soil more than all the rest of the * a foot but is dear and sacred and a * * are about to * it under foot and * its people every * of

chair and was silent at the same moment a * was heard at the door it opened * and nighthawk * into the apartment under his * i saw the gray uniform of a confederate soldier in his hand he carried a letter nighthawk * mr * and myself with * respect his quick eye however had caught the gloomy and * expression of the * countenance and he was silent well said mr * raising his head with a deep sigh then passing his hand over his face he seemed to * away all emotion when he again looked up his face was as calm and * as at the * of our interview you see i begin a new scene in this * he said to me in a low tone and turning to nighthawk he said well you followed that agreeable person yes sir said nighthawk with great respect she turned out to be the character you supposed speak before colonel surry nighthawk bowed i never had any doubt of her character sir he said you will remember that she called on you a week ago * that she was a spy who had * visited the federal lines and washington you described her to me and informed me that you had given her another appointment for tonight when i assured you that i knew her she was an enemy who had come as a spy upon us and you directed me to be here tonight and follow her after your interview well said mr * quietly you followed her yes sir on leaving you after making her * report of affairs in washington she got into her carriage and the * started rapidly going up capitol and grace streets i followed on foot and had to * i am used to that sir the carriage stopped at a house in the upper part of the * mr * the lady got out telling the * to wait and went into the house where she * for about half an hour she then came * was in the shadow of a tree not ten yards from the spot and as she got into the carriage i could see that she held in her hand a letter as the * closed the door she said take me to the * * on ninth street next door to the war office the * mounted his box and set * crossing the street i commenced running to get ahead in this i succeeded and reached the * five minutes before the carriage well sir i hastened up * and went into the * where three or four * were * the letters left to be sent by the * boat tomorrow they were laughing and * as they read aloud the * letters from the * and other * of which i assure you were very * * the * * were heard upon the * and she came in smiling i had turned my back having given some excuse for my presence to one of the * who is an acquaintance thus the lady who knows me could not see my face but i could by looking out of the * of my eyes see her she came in in her rich gray * smiling on the * and * an open letter to one of them * you * me by sending that to my sister in new york by the * boat tomorrow sir if there is nothing * in it madam said the * oh she replied with a laugh it is only on family matters my sister is a * and so am i sir you can read the letter it is not very dangerous and she smiled so * that the * was almost ashamed to read the letter he however glanced his eye over it and evidently found nothing wrong in it while he was doing so the lady walked toward the * in which the * had been * such letters as they found * the others being marked * and thrown into a basket as she passed near one of the * i saw the lady whom i was closely watching * her * as though by accident across the mouth of one of the * and at the same instant her hand stole down and dropped a letter into the * as she did so the * who had finished reading the other letter bowed and said there is nothing * in this madam and it will be sent of course i was sure of that sir replied the lady with a smile i am very much obliged good evening sir and she * out all the * * rising as she did so no sooner had the door closed than i * upon the * in which i had seen her drop the letter the * wished to stop me but i informed them of what i had seen if they * they could see for themselves that the letter which i had easily found was not * with the * of the * they looked at it and at once * their * arrest her exclaimed one of them suddenly the rapid * of a carriage came like an * to his words it is useless gentlemen i said i know where to find the lady and will look to the whole affair you know i am in the secret service and will be * * for every thing i will take this letter to the official who directed me to watch the lady who brought it to this no * was made as i am known at the office i came away returned as quickly as possible and here is the letter sir with which words nighthawk drew his hand from under his * and presented the letter to mr * who had listened in silence to his narrative mr * took the letter broke the * and ran his eye over the contents * that woman is a * person he said she * in troubled waters with the * of an * hand and * the letter to me the * said would you like to see a * of the sort of * which go on * in the * colonel i took the letter and read the following words richmond # * 1864 tell you know who that i have just seen the honorable mr here the writer gave the real name and official position of mr * and have had a long conversation with him he is fully * that i am a good confederate and spoke without reserve of matters the most private he is in high spirits and looks on the rebel cause as certain to * i never saw one more * to the real state of things richmond is full of misery and the people seem in despair but this high official who * the whole government is evidently certain of lees success i found him in a * * and he did not * his views the government has just received heavy supplies from the south by the * * are * whole country in rear of sherman is * lee he stated would soon be * by between fifty and * thousand men what was more important still was a * which he read me from england this startled me there seems no doubt that england is about to recognize the confederacy when he had finished reading this * on the back of which i could see the english * he said to * are his * see things were never * it is only a question of time and by holding out a little longer we shall * the enemy to retire and give up the contest with the * coming lee will have about one hundred thousand men with that force he will be able to * all general grants * things look dark at this moment but the cause was never more * he seemed * but i give you his words it is certain that these are the views of the government and that our authorities are much mistaken in * the confederacy at its last * it is impossible that the honorable mr was * to * me because i carried him a letter from here the writer gave the name of a prominent official of the confederate government which i * who * for me and declared that i was * southern in my * i shall see the honorable mr in a day or two again in the mean while i am * * at the house of our friend mr * who has * me every * in return for the * i brought him to protect his property when we occupy richmond the city is in a terrible state mr * has just come in and * me that

with again tell him to be in good spirits this city has still a great deal of money * in * we shall soon be here then we can retire on a * when * is * we will * it and live in * i looked at the back of the letter it was directed to a lady in * from the letter my glance passed to the face of mr * he was smiling * a valuable * he said which madam will doubtless * before very long with additional * i make you a present of it colonel as a * of the war i * him and placed the letter in my pocket today i copy it word for word mr * * a moment then he said to nighthawk arrest this woman i am tired of her i have no time to * upon such persons however charming nighthawk looked greatly delighted i was going to beg that order of you sir he said as the private business * to in the letter * a friend of mine greatly ah well here is the order and taking a pen mr * * two lines which he handed to nighthawk a glow of satisfaction came to that * face and taking the paper he carefully placed it in his pocket as he did so the bell in the capitol square struck midnight and i rose to take my departure come and see me soon again colonel said mr * going to the door with me he had made a sign to nighthawk who rose to go out with me that he wished him to remain what i have said to you tonight continued the * * may have been * colonel i am not certain of * i am quite sure that to have it repeated at this time would be * be * therefore my dear * the war tell or write what you fancy and i should rather have my present views known then than not known they are those neither of a * a faint heart or a * i stand like the * * at the gate of * awaiting the * * that will * me i see it * hear the * know destruction is * on * i am a * on post i stand where i have been posted it is god and my conscience that have placed me on duty here i will stay whatever comes until i am relieved by the same authority which posted me and with the bow of a * the * * bade me farewell i returned to my * buried in thought * deeply on the strange scenes of this night of december on the next morning i set out and * the army at petersburg i too was a * on post like the * and i determined to remain on duty to the last the months of january and february 1865 dragged on * and dreary two or three * which i made during that * period gave me a good idea of the condition of the country in september 1864 i had * virginia from petersburg to winchester and had found the * those of the lower * * * brave resolved to resist to the death in january and february 1865 my official duties carried me to the region around * to the mountains west of lynchburg and to the north carolina * south of petersburg all had changed everywhere i found the people looking * hopeless and utterly * the shadow of the approaching * seemed to have already fallen upon them the army was as game as * * little * soon to be struck and * by general * ten thousand cavalry everywhere the soldiers laughed in the face of death each seemed to feel as did the old * with whom i had * on that night at richmond that he was a * on post and must stand there to the last the * might * him but he was posted and must stand until relieved by his commanding officer or death it was the poor private in his ragged * and old shoes as well as the officer in his * coat who felt thus for those private soldiers of the army of northern virginia were gentlemen * * was their * and they meant to die * in hand oh soldiers of the army who carried those * in a hundred * fought with them from manassas in 1861 to appomattox in #* are the real * of the mighty struggle and one comrade * you now as he looked at you with admiration in old days what i saw in those * was dreary enough but however black may be the * there is always the * of * somewhere we laughed now and then reader even in the winter of # i laugh still as i think of the brave * of the horse artillery near * of the * breathed their commander * and playing with his young * whom he had called stuart for his courage i hear the good old songs all about * and the * tree and the * blue * * with * voices in that dreary winter as in other days when the star of hope shone more * and the future was more * at lynchburg where i encountered a number of old friends songs still * * * the lips of my dear companions major gray and captain * how we laughed and sang on that winter night at lynchburg do you * your sweet * * still gray and you * do you sing in your beautiful and touching * today the heart bowed down by deep despair to * hopes will * across the years comes once more that * * again i hear your voice filled with the very soul of * tell how memory is the only friend that grief can call its own that seemed * * to the situation at the time the memory of our great * was all that was left to us and i thought that it was the spirit of grief itself that was singing again i hear the * * * * * * the most exquisite of all * songs then he winds up with * praise of the * * * the long hours of night * away on the wings of laughter as birds * * and are buried in the night are you there still gray do you sing still * health and happiness comrades all friendly stars smile on you across the years and the long * that * us i * you thus at * and lynchburg reader gay scenes broke the * in my journey toward north carolina i found food also for laughter i had gone to * fifty miles south of petersburg to * the cavalry and in riding on i looked with curiosity on the * which the enemy had * along the * railroad when they had destroyed it in the month of december * private houses * * all were black and * * the railroad was a spectacle the enemy had formed line of battle close along the * then at the signal this line of battle had attacked the road the iron * were torn from the * the latter were then * up and fired the * were placed upon the * mass and left there until they became * in the middle and both * bent * they had been seized broken * in a wild spirit of * the men had borne some of the * * to trees near the road * them three or four times around the * and there as i passed were the unfortunate trees with their iron * around * of the * * of the blue people months before hill and hampton had attacked and driven them back from the dead horses as elsewhere rose the black * on * wings but it is no part of my purpose reader to weary you with these * or describe * scenes it is an * interview which i had on my return toward petersburg that my memory * it has * to do with my * then it will not fill more than a page i had encountered two wagons and riding ahead of them saw a * of army headquarters whose name was * i * the smiling youth in return for his own * and said where have you been * to * colonel on a * expedition for the general and some of the staff colonel * smiled we rode on together how did you come to be a * * i said well this was the way of it colonel he said i belonged to the old stonewall brigade but general lee * me at the start of the war to * the headquarters horses it was old general robert that sent me with these wagons i was * the generals gray and had just * the * when he sent for me a man had started with the wagons and had * in the field right by headquarters so old general robert says says he * you can get them out i says general i think i can if * give me a * full of your french * for the boys he laughed at that and i says general i have been with you three years and if in that time you have ever seen me out of the way i hope you will tell me so no * says he i have not and you shall have the * and his black fellow went into the * and drew me a * full for you see colonel old general robert always * a * full and * it about in his old black spring wagon to give to the wounded * dont drink himself well i got the * and set the boys to work building a road with pine * and got the wagons out from that time to this i have been going with them colonel and sometimes some very curious things have happened i assumed that * expression of countenance dear to * * saw it and smiled last fall colonel he said i was down on the * * with my wagons for old general robert when a * of yankees crossed in the * and caught me i did not try to get off and the colonel says says he who are you i told him i was only * with general lees headquarters * to get something for the old general to eat as nothing could be bought in petersburg and says i i have long been looking to be captured and now the time has come as i was talking i saw an uncle of mine among the yankees and says he * what are you doing here the same you are doing there i says and i asked the colonel just to let me off this time and i would try and keep out of their way * he asked me would i come down there any more and i told him i * * would have to go where i was ordered well says he you cant beg off but i says step here a minute colonel and i took him to the wagon and offered him my * of * he took three or four good * and then he says says he thats all i want you can go on with your wagons and i tell you i put out quick colonel and never looked behind me till i got back to petersburg i have attempted to recall here reader the few * of sunshine the rare moments of laughter which i enjoyed in those months of the winter of # i * from * on the events of that dreary * every day i lost some friend one day it was the brave john * whom i had known and loved from his childhood the next day it was some other whose * left a gap in my life which nothing * could fill i pass over all that why recall more of the desolate * than is necessary for the rest that is only a * laugh that i have * in events draw near at the memory of which you * even * * when three years have passed for this page is written on the morning of april # # this day three years ago lee was * on in sight of appomattox these letters and figures * terrible * they not reader you * as you return in thought to that * provided always that you then wore the gray and not the blue if you wore the blue you perhaps laugh the south had reached in this month of march one of those * when the most * can see through the black darkness no single * of light throughout the winter the government had made * efforts to bring out the resources of the * honest and * if not always * as the days and weeks and months wore on it became more and more evident that the hours of the confederacy were * the * of * negro troops which congress long opposed had been adopted at last but only in time to be too late the peace commissioners had held their interview with lincoln but effected nothing the enemy * advanced toward the * of their end sherman had safely made his famous march to the * and charleston had * western army was about to unite with the army of grant at petersburg there the great game went on but the end was near lee had attempted late in february to * his lines but was * his army was reduced to about forty thousand while grants * about one hundred and fifty thousand the confederate troops were almost * and had * food enough to * life they fought still in the trenches along the great line of works but it was plain as lee said that the line was stretched so far that a very little more would * it that line extended from the williamsburg road east of richmond to five forks west of * distance of nearly fifty miles gradually grant had pushed * until his grasp was now very nearly upon the * road lee had extended his own thin line to still * him the white oak road beyond the * had been * by heavy works the hill above * * with batteries the extreme right of the confederate line rested in the vicinity of five forks beyond that it could not be extended already it began to * along the works * from east to west there was * a soldier every ten yards grant was only prevented from * through by the * * of lees * rapid * of * at the points which he threatened the cavalry was almost * the destruction of the * road * to * in december had been a * nearly to that arm of the service the confederate cavalry had * upon it * their * from * creek station now they had been compelled to go south to * the * point fifty miles from petersburg the consequence was that lees right was almost * by cavalry grants * could * almost * to the * and * * the * was not that this was effected at the end of march but that it was not effected a month sooner but i * to glance for an instant before * at the condition of the country it had reached the last point of * and was * to despair the government was * * had ceased to * attention the press * in vain the * * the members of congress from the * states the * urged that the members of the virginia legislature to be * in the spring should be * with the state sovereignty to

what the * had left the yankee cavalry took a lady of * said to a federal officer general i can understand why you destroy * and bridges but why do you burn * and the houses over women and children the officer bowed and replied madam your soldiers are so brave that we cant beat you and we are trying to * you the * of these homes of the country was a touching spectacle the women were making every

it was a relief to be back in the army to see brave faces and smiles around me instead of gloomy eyes and * cheeks as in the city i passed along the * road almost * crossed the * at * and went on by general lees powerful works * the white oak road beyond soon i was approaching * courthouse in the vicinity of which was * our small force of * and * cavalry hampton had gone to meet sherman and the cavalry was commanded now by general fitzhugh lee who had recovered from his severe wound received at winchester i was greeted by this brave soldier and accomplished gentleman as * as i could have * general fitz as we always called him at stuarts headquarters was the soul of good * and good * you have seen him have you not * you wore gray or * beside him or meeting him in battle you recall the open and * features the frank and * glance of the eye the long * and heavy * almost always * with laughter you remember the * voice the quick * the tone of * * and brave air which said as long as life * there is hope you have not forgotten this gay * the * of stuart this born * with his love of * his * * his familiar * of high and low his charming * and * laughter that was the character of the * fitz lee the good companion the commanderinchief has * for all the * of majorgeneral fitzhugh lee it was general * lee who wrote him in 1863 your * conduct devotion to the cause of your country and devotion to duty fill me with pleasure i hope you will soon see her efforts for independence crowned with success and long live to enjoy the affection and gratitude of your country these few lines were worth fighting hard * they not all things change many things fail * or * may come but the good opinion of lee will * all i talked with general fitz lee for an hour nearly * the old days with stuart who had loved and * in him more than in any other living man it was a beautiful friendship indeed and each understood the value of the other as man and soldier stuart is dead and can not give his * but general fitz lee is alive and can give his here and there a voice still * stuarts genius as a commander ask his friend who * and if tears do not * the voice you will learn the real rank of stuart but i can not * on these scenes the narrative * on i mounted my horse after * hands with general fitz lee and his brave staff and for the first time remembered to ask where was tom * at that question a * smile came to every countenance done for said one captured laughed another * * and * with the enemy said a third well where is the place of * are the terms being arranged i said at a place called * on the lower * good i know the road there i said and with a laugh which the general and his gay * * i touched my gray with the * and set out toward the south i pushed on having resolved after * my duties to visit * soon * courthouse came in sight i entered the small village and looked * i had done on more than one occasion * the * which general * narrative had surrounded with so strange an interest there was the old tavern with its long * where darke had held his * and from which he had set forth on his * of * and murder there was the county * in which general davenant had insisted upon being confined and where so many friends had visited him there was the old courthouse in which he had been tried for the murder of george conway and i * i could * upon one of the * the broken * which darke had forced more than ten years before in order to * the * with which the crime had been committed for some miles that tragic story absorbed me * all other * that was surely the * of * the * had by no means reached its * between the first and last acts an * of ten years is supposed to pass there was the stage direction darke was still alive active dangerous bent on * he had an able * in his female * that singular woman with whom his life was so closely connected was in prison it was true but the confederate authorities might * her she might at any moment * her * had she found that * had mohun found it in any event she was * so even than her * * worthy whom i might meet at every turn in the * prince of * and tragic * * these are * this man and this woman i said they are two * * of daring and * mohun has escaped them * but now when the enemy seem driving us and * every thing before them will not darke and madam * their * and come out * in the struggle with that reflection i * the subject and pushed on over the narrow and * roads to make my * the day was cold and brilliant the winds cut the face and i rode on steadily thinking of many things then the desire to smoke seized upon me general fitzhugh lee had given me some excellent * captured from the enemy and i looked around to find some house where i could light my cigar none appeared but at two hundred yards from the road in a hidden * i thought i * the * of a * made by some * i rode toward it * into the * approached the fire beside which * a figure wrapped in an * the figure raised its * i recognized nighthawk he rose and smiled * as he shook hands with me an unexpected meeting nighthawk i said laughing what on earth makes you come out and camp in the woods a little fancy colonel you know i am * i like this way of living from having * so * i came here with an object what to be private i thought my fire could not be seen from the road why should it not be well perhaps i * danger but i am on an important * * to * and not be * am going tonight through the lines on a little affair of which you know something ah what do you * to that paper said nighthawk * it is in the hands of * is a yankee * at his * i am going to see him and force him to surrender it is it possible he has it do you know that * enough colonel do you remember that woman * perfectly i visited her with mohun he told me of your visit well you no doubt remember also colonel that he offered her a large * to discover the * she offered to try and find it or give him a * to its * was to return in ten days and hear her report yes i said well he returned colonel but * could tell him * you no doubt have heard yes from him i have been more successful at last in * with this strange woman i do not know if she is a * or an * or * she has * me that * has the paper we want and nighthawk proceeded to explain it was an exceedingly curious explanation * had first demanded of him a statement of all the facts he had * informed her of the appointment which he had made with swartz in richmond to meet him three days afterward at the house of * his * by the * so that he had been unable to keep the * statement when he saw him that swartz had not been to his * * * in the lonely house * in his murder by darke that was all he knew he * paper was * was it at mr * * had replied i only asked you this mr nighthawk to * myself that my * were true i saw poor mr swartz go to mr * and ask for you on the day you appointed when he was told that you had not come he seemed very * and told mr * that he must see you to give you a paper his life was threatened he said on account of that paper an officer and a lady had discovered that he had that * was as much as his life was worth to keep it on his * mr * would take it and for old times sake put it away until he came back he would pay him as much gold as he could hold in both hands then he gave the paper to mr * and went away telling him to say nothing of it i then asked her continued nighthawk where the paper could be found she replied that * always carried it on his person that was a few days ago i am going tonight to see him and recover the paper i had listened to this narrative with strange interest this singular woman was a curious * were her * really such as she described them or did she only put this and that together as the * is and by her * * * possibly by * * at results which * the most * glance of the * i knew * * often upon this subject since have finally come to the latter conclusion as the more * of the two * is * of mind and body and one of the most * * of * is * is only another word for * and * * of brain * arrived at strange results but i think she * them by * her * in this affair could be thus explained almost * as to the truth of the explanation i felt a singular * that it was correct well that is curious enough i said and i wish you success nighthawk what of our other female * fair lady you arrested in richmond she is safe enough colonel and i dont think she will trouble us soon i am glad of it i think her the more dangerous of the two and i * with you when did you see darke last i have not met him for three months he can not be dead he may be wounded and * he at his headquarters nighthawk smiled he is at five forks today colonel and * davenant in richmond on business at the war department * so i shall see * another time and * my horse i added good * nighthawk thank you * same to you and leaving nighthawk * down beside his fire i rode on * on i reached the cavalry and horse artillery which i was soon done * see i * official matters with * * * i went on across * bridge and along the * foot road toward * following amid a great wind and falling * this * road * * between its lofty walls of * wild and deserted * outside of the * and completely * i * * creek rode on over a * and came just at sunset in sight of the hill upon which * raised its ancient * near the * my horse * as he * up and passed under the great * he seemed to feel that this was something like home to him now and that his days march was over in fact all the months of winter i had * stopped at * on my way to the cavalry at * my friends had * * was not a single * on the * in front of me there and i would certainly be captured some * i had * in * there still on every * which i made how to resist the * * was just thirty miles from petersburg i always reached its vicinity as night fell on the dark winter days i was always cold hungry weary * by the * gray * and i knew what awaited me * * fire a good supper and * smiles *

back in * by the * wind could you have * that my dear reader would you have * from yankee * parties for my part i thought i would risk it i might be surprised and captured at any * territory was open to the * i would have had a charming evening would have been * by * * i was alive and free i would have lived and in a manner the most delightful * some angel had watched over me and * had been * by the enemys * parties without so much as a * at the * bridge within half a mile i had sat by the fire * * * laughed and * with my good friends slept * in a real bed and gone on my way in the morning * i had thus always escaped surprise no enemy ever * me it was the old * however of the * that went to the well so * let me go on with my narrative as my horse uttered his * * now * through the march evening the door opened and * ran out to * me she had never looked more beautiful and i recall still as though i had seen it yesterday the charming smile on her red lips the wind * back her * till they * golden * * cheeks were * madam i say this to some one who is leaning over my shoulder and laughing dont * me these smiling memories * was only my little * as it * is married and far away now *

reader and the most * and * of us all have much of the animal in us that is a * * i was * hungry and at that moment i think my attention was more closely * on the table than even upon miss * with her

again then seeing tom rise * get his horse ready he * requested him to have my own * and returned to the table i had just raised the cup of tea to my lips amid * from the family to take care or i would be captured when a * * up the hill and stopped in front of the door look out the yankees are coming he cried i glanced through the window and recognized a man of * command who also recognized me how near are they i said * to * the burning tea not a quarter of a mile off colonel that will give me time i said and i applied myself again to the tea which this time i poured out into the * in order to cool it look out colonel cried the man where are they at the gate i finished the tea and the * of * just as the man * here they are right on you colonel and i heard the sound of a * horse accompanied by * at the retreating * i went quickly to the window a column of federal cavalry was rapidly * the hill by the last * of day i recognized darke at the head of the column and by his side rode mr * i thought i could see that darke was thin and very pale but was not certain the light was faint and i had only one * suggested a quick retreat i just * * through the door in rear of the mansion at the very moment when a number of the enemy who had hastily dismounted rushed in at the front door tom was mounted and holding my horse which the good boy had * with his own hands i leaped to saddle and had scarcely done so when a pistol * * by my head it had * through a * of the window from * a loud * followed we had been * under these circumstances my dear reader we always ran in the late war some persons considered it * to run or * but they were * dont run until you are obliged to but then run like the said a * general and one day when a lady was telling general * lee how a friend of hers had * once the general turned to the laughing officer and said in his deep voice thats right captain * all you can i have often * and more than once * rapidly on this occasion tom and i thought that retreat was the * course in a moment we had disappeared in the woods followed by pistol * and some of the enemy they did not * us far the federal cavalry did not like the virginia woods in ten minutes their * were no longer heard their * died away and returning on our steps we came once more in sight of * and * the enemy were not visible and riding up we dismounted and entered the enemy had * up my supper a glance at the table told the whole tragic * the * family were * in a condition to think of my misfortune the enemy had * for a few moments only but in that time the family had gathered important information of their * they were going to surprise and attack general fitz lee that night and had not so much as halted as they passed the house to gain a * beyond they were commanded the men said by a general darke and * by a man living near * neck whose name was * this information of the enemys design * all other thoughts from my mind and * we ran to our * i think i heard something like a kiss in the shadow of the * as tom and * parted we * into the woods following a course * to that taken by the enemys cavalry and keeping as close to it as was safe a sudden parting between yourself and * tom i said as we * on a touching spectacle when will you be married in a week or * answer seriously old fellow * tom is it possible even so my boy here at * no in richmond * family are * there now and i was going to escort her to petersburg tomorrow but for these * i will do it yet good i hope the way will be clear then let us go on there is no time to lose in order to * general fitz we pushed on following * and making toward * courthouse half an hour thus passed and we were near the * bridge road when suddenly the whole forest on our right * with * loud * accompanied the firing the woods * as * rushed through them an obstinate fight was going on in the darkness between the federal and confederate cavalry plainly the confederates had not been surprised and the * and * with which they met the federal * seemed to * their enemies for fifteen minutes the combat continued with great fury amid the pines the air was filled with quick * of flame with the * of * with loud cheers and * then the wave of federal * * back toward the * the confederates pressed them with cheer and the affair * in a * pursuit tom and myself had * into the * early in the action and my * had been cut out of my hat by a * * which a big blue worthy * at me this was my only accident however in fifteen minutes i had the pleasure of seeing our friends run i followed with the rest for about a mile then i drew * and turned * horse was completely exhausted i slowly returned toward * courthouse * for a moment whether i would * at the tavern shook my head in a manner not * to the * and set out to spend the night at five forks i did not know until some days afterward that a serious accident had happened to the worthy mr * guide and friend of general darke he had been struck by a * in the fight had * his wings * * from his horse and * * visit thus went for nothing mr * was dead i shall not * upon the evening and night spent at five * whose * i was met and cordially greeted by the * judge conway in the great drawingroom i found the young ladies who hastened to * me supper and i still remember that * of every * of * smiling * above which rose the * neck of a * these * * of * will i fear * some readers but these are my * and * mean * i have forgotten a dozen battles but still remember that * in march 1865 i spent the evening in cordial * with the excellent judge conway and his daughters and on the next morning set out on my return to petersburg mohun had not been visible at the first sound of the firing he had mounted his horse and * at a gallop so much for my visit to five forks i pass thus rapidly over it with real * the want of space which * me to do so do you love the * rose and the * * of the valley reader i could have shown you those flowers in georgia and virginia conway they were * cordial and * was their * father they spoke and moved and looked as only the * can pardon that * word * so * in the present * i am only * when i seem to * that i considered the stately old judge better than the black servant who waited upon me at supper of mohun and will davenant i had said nothing in * with the smiling young ladies but i think miss georgia stately and * as she was looked at me with a peculiar smile which said you are his friend and cannot be a mere ordinary acquaintance to me and here i ought to * the reader that since that first visit of mine to

rode on in deep thought but soon my * was * just as i reached the hill above * who should i see coming from the direction of the * tom * and * dare * dare on a little * with a riding * reaching nearly to the * her * little figure clearly * by the * a * little riding hat * * upon her * her cheeks full of roses her lips full of smiles her eyes * like two blue waves which the wind * dont find fault

blessing i reached petersburg on the evening of march # 1865 the ride was a gay * a tragedy was about to follow it on the very next morning in the gray march dawn lee was going to strike his last great blow at grant a column under gordon that brave of * was going to be * * against * hill the enemys centre just below petersburg that design was evidently the result of supreme * or of despair in either case it indicated the terrible character of the * there could be no two opinions upon that point lee * at nothing less than to cut general grants army in * * himself * in the very centre of his enemies and to force general grant to draw back the entire left wing of his army or run the risk by holding his position to have it destroyed was lees * to open the way for his retreat over the * road toward * i know not military * say so and it is certain that a month before he had * to retreat the government had * him then but now that step was plainly the only one left he might effect his retreat by * grant to draw in his left wing for the support of his centre lee could then retire from * hill make a rapid march * * for north carolina and * his forces with those of johnston continue the war in the * states falling back if necessary to texas i have always thought that this was his design but i was much too * a * to gain any personal knowledge of his plans it is certain that he * one of two * to open the path for his retreat or to relieve his right wing toward five forks which was * under the immense pressure upon it either * was that of a good * what seemed wild * was sound common sense for the rest there was little else to do some change in the * of things was * necessary grant had been * by a large portion of * army and the federal troops in front of lee now * about one hundred and fifty thousand as lees force all told on his entire line was only about forty thousand the * of the * * at some point seemed only a question of time and scarcely that rather a question of the moment selected by grant for his great blow at the end of march the hour of decisive struggle was plainly at hand the wind had * the roads artillery could move the federal left was nearly in sight of the * road one spring and general grant could lay hold on that great * and then nothing would be left to lee but retreat or surrender such was the condition of things at petersburg in these last days of march grant was ready with his one hundred and fifty thousand infantry to strike lees forty thousand sheridan was ready with his twelve thousand * mounted cavalry to * himself against the two thousand * * on * and * * under command of general fitz lee a child could have told the result the idea of resistance with any hope in the * any longer was a * lee was a great * * few greater the army of northern virginia was * * of the world show none * but there was one thing which neither great * or supreme courage could effect opposed by one hundred and fifty thousand * troops with every * of war forty thousand * men * a line of forty miles must in the end meet capture or destruction the country did not see it but general lee did the * brave * a * confidence in the great commander and his old army it had repulsed the enemy so * that the * people believed it * lee had * grant so * that he was looked upon as the very god of victory defeat could not come to him glory would ever follow his steps on the * of the old army of northern virginia led by lee the * of victory would still * * * and * to the end while the * were saying this lee was preparing to retreat nothing * that clear * eyes of the great chief * every * he saw the blow * shadow of the grant * as the * was lifted ran * the #* of march lees * made it last * but when his adversary * to avoid it it was lee who was going to retreat that * was sudden and * it did not accomplish its object in the dark march morning gordon the * of the army advanced with three thousand men across the * in front of * hill what followed was a fierce tragedy as brief and deadly as the fall of a * gordon rushed at the head of his column over the space which separated the lines * the federal * at the point of the * seized on fort * a powerful work and the batteries * it then as the light * in the east he looked back for * none * was holding the centre of grants army with three thousand men what he had won was by * * enemy had been

he had * the * trunk but it was the trunk which now held the * in its * * gordon retreated with his * * was the second or third time that this king of battle had nearly accomplished * by the * of his

unless the wound be * to change the figure grant had * the almost * thrust of lee and now with the famous * lifted and * * * the final and decisive blow at the crest of his great adversary on * march 29th the federal commander commenced the general movement which had for its object the destruction of lees right wing and the * of the * road before dawn the * of blue infantry began to move * across the * * down bridges over the * as the columns passed on and on the night of the same day the corps of * and warren were near * courthouse with their extreme right guarded by * cavalry such was the work of * the great moment had evidently arrived lee * at a single glance the whole design of his adversary collected about fifteen thousand men nearly half his army and leaving longstreet north of the james and only a skirmish line around petersburg marched * beyond the * to meet the enemy on the white oak road on the morning of the 30th all was ready for general grants great blow but the * were * to the federal side in the night a heavy rain had fallen all day on the 30th it continued to rain and military movements were impossible the two great * looked at each * drawn up for the

from * courthouse toward the * road and warren was in sight of the white oak road when suddenly lee * a column against him and drove him back the confederates followed with wild cheers * to turn the enemys left and finish them but the attempt was in vain federal * arrived lee found his own flank exposed and fell back * to the white oak road again having given the enemy a great * but * nothing as he retired intelligence reached him that * cavalry were advancing upon five forks that position was the key of the whole * country if sheridan seized and occupied this great * lees right was turned a column was sent without delay and reached the spot to find sheridan in possession of the place short work was made of him falling upon the federal cavalry pickett and fitzhugh lee drove them back upon * rapidly after * but for the terrible swamp into which the late * had * the low grounds would have followed them to the courthouse and * in rear of the left wing of the federal army that was the turning point if pickett and fitz lee had reached * courthouse and attacked in the enemys rear while lee * them in front it is difficult to believe that the battle would not have resulted in a confederate victory such was the alarm of general grant at the new * of affairs that late at night he withdrew warren and ordered him to * toward * courthouse to * sheridan in his hour of need then if our * column could have pushed * lee had then * all this is * reader * had * otherwise the * column could not * ten at night it was withdrawn by * found the two armies resting on their arms awaiting the morning of the first of april i have * to present a rapid but * * of the great events which took place on the lines around petersburg from the morning of the 29th of march when general grant began his general movement to the night of the #* when he * lee on the white oak road ready after a day of * combat which had decided little to * the struggle on the next morning for the possession of the * road this * has been of necessity a brief and general one for this volume has for its object rather to * the * of a set of * than to record the history of an * crowded with tragic scenes i cannot here * the great picture the * and the time are both * the rapid * which i have given will present a sufficient * i return now to those * whose lives i have tried to * and who were destined to reach the * in their private * at the moment when the confederacy reached its own i shall therefore beg the reader to leave the confederate forces at bay on the white oak * * column under pickett and johnson falling back on five * accompany me to the house of the same name within a mile of the famous * where on the night of the #* of march some singular scenes are to be * it was the night fixed for * marriage i had been requested to act as his first * and * to * him during the day he had informed me that he * to his design of being married in spite of every thing when night came at last on this day of battles i was * out with the * riding on staff duty but i remembered my promise again mounted my horse and set out for five forks where in any event i was sure of a warm welcome * on over the white oak road i turned * at five forks and riding on toward judge * had just reached the road coming in from * courthouse when i heard a * approaching from that quarter at a rapid gallop he was * by toward five forks when by the * i recognized mohun * i * he knew my voice and drew * with an * of pleasure thanks my dear old friend he said * my hand i knew you would not fail me your wedding will take place mohun yes battle or no battle you are right life is * you will hear cannon instead of * probably at your * that will be * what is the news from the courthouse our infantry is falling back the condition of the roads stopped them yes it was impossible to get on and they have been recalled by order of general lee listen there is the column * are falling back to five forks a mile north of judge * in fact as we rode on now i heard the * tramp of a column and the * of artillery * in the woods the enemy will follow i suppose not before morning i hope i smiled meanwhile you are making good use of the time to get married what will you do with miss georgia you mean mrs mohun surry he said smiling yes well she will be sent * father will take the whole family to petersburg in the morning to avoid the battle which will probably take place in this vicinity tomorrow you are right i * a * fight here in the morning which i hope i shall not * in my dear surry said mohun smiling is there any danger of that i really dont know it is not good for a soldier to be too happy it makes him * from * and * * of a young widow in mourning * over a * * stop that * i said is it possible that a * * like general mohun can * in such * at a moment as happy as this i saw him smile sadly in the dim * i am much changed he said gently i no longer risk my life * to throw it away once as you know surry i was a poor * and my conscience was * with a terrible crime life was little to me then and i would not have * if a * cut it short i was reckless desperate and had no hope now i have * a great deal more than * have happiness my hands are not * with the blood of that man and * have the love of a pure girl who is going to give her life to * i have prayed to god for pardon and been * i * that * being would not make my poor life bright again but let me stop this talk a strange conversation for a wedding night let me say again however my dear surry that i have no * now i no longer hate that man and would not * that woman for * on earth let them * are * to me i appeal to god to witness the * of my * and the * with which i have prayed forgive us our * as we forgive those who have * against us i reached out my hand in the darkness and pressed that of the * you are right * is something greater more noble than * is * more than ever i can say now of you what i said after hearing your history that night what was that old friend that you were no longer the bitter * * your * and * at all * longer the gay * * to battle as a * you were * entirely changed * your character was * and * that now you were a * soldier fit to live or die with lee would that i were he * * his head fall upon his breast that is much to say of any man but i will add more you are worthy of * * of five forks as i uttered these words we reached the gate a moment afterward we had entered the grounds * our horses and were * to the house on the * we were met by judge conway with a bow and a smile he pressed our hands cordially but with a * * which i suppose comes to the heart of every father who is about to part with a beloved * give up his place as it were to * then we entered the great drawingroom where a gentleman in a white * and black coat awaited us no other persons were visible the great apartment was a charming spectacle with its brilliant * and * fire the * walls * in light shadows the long * were drawn down completely * the march air coming in out of the night this smiling * was * * and delightful as we entered the * gentleman rose * and smiled the * mr hope said judge conway * him and mr hope with the same gentle smile upon his lips advanced and shook hands at that name i had seen mohun suddenly start and turn pale then his head rose quickly his * disappeared and he said with entire * mr hope and myself are old * i may even say old friends to these words mr hope made a gentle and smiling reply and it was plain that he was very far from * the * before him with the terrible tragedy which had taken place at * in december # what was the * of this * had the worthy man in his * parsonage simply heard of the sudden * of mohun the lady and her brother had his solitary life prevented him from hearing the * * and * which must have followed that event this was the * explanation and i believe the correct one certain it is that the worthy mr hope received us with smiling * doubtless he recalled the past but was too kind to spread a gloom over * feelings by * to his loss in a few moments we were seated and judge conway explained the presence of the * the explanation was simple mohun * engaged on duty had begged judge conway to send a message to the * of his * the * was absent leaving his church * in charge of his * mr hope thus that gentleman by a strange chance was about to * at * second marriage as he had at his first i have explained thus perhaps * an incident which struck me at the time as most singular are there * in this world the presence of the * mr hope on that night at five forks * one of those strange * which make us believe in the * of * having exchanged * with the * mohun and i were shown to a * no sooner had the door closed than i said to mohun that is strange is it not singular indeed he replied * but i am not * to this worthy mans presence surry i have no * i have * my whole life to judge conway and georgia they both know the circumstances which lead to the * that that woman was already married when she married * the proof of her marriage with darke * judge conway is a * and knows that in * * the * of circumstances * every other * thus it is not as an * that my fathers son * this house all is known and i do not * from the eye of this good man who is about to * at my marriage does he know all i think not i had half resolved to tell him but there is no time now let us get ready the hour is near and mohun looked at his watch nine oclock he said the ceremony takes place at ten and he rapidly made his * the light fell on a * * he was * in full dress uniform with the * and stars of a brigadiergeneral the erect figure was clearly * by the coat * from * to * above rose the * head with the lofty brow the brilliant black eyes the dark * and * beneath which you saw the firm lips we * to the drawingroom where judge conway and mr hope awaited us fifteen minutes afterward light steps were heard upon the great * the old * opened the door and miss georgia conway entered the apartment leaning upon the arm of her father she was * in simple white * with a * of * in her dark hair and i have never seen a more exquisite beauty her cheeks * with fresh roses a charming smile just parted her lips and her dark eyes grand and calm shone out from the * forehead from which her black hair was carried back in midnight * * in * * it was truly a * * whom i gazed at on this night and with eyes * upon the lovely face i very nearly lost sight of miss virginia who followed her sister i hastened to offer my arm to the * little flower and followed judge conway who approached the * standing * in hand in the middle of the apartment in another instant mohun was standing beside miss georgia and the ceremony began it was not destined to proceed far the * had nearly finished the * with which the form for the * of * * all at i once i was certain that i heard steps on the * and in the hall of the mansion the rest seemed not to hear them however and mr hope continued the ceremony into this holy estate he went on these two persons present come now to be joined if any man can show just cause why they may not * be joined together let him now speak or else * forever hold his peace as he uttered the words the door was suddenly burst open and darke entered the apartment with the gray woman in the midst of the * of astonishment she advanced straight toward georgia conway * her arm in that of the young lady and said quietly how do you do cousin i am * conway your father is my uncle i have come to show just cause why you cannot marry general * husband mohun turned like a * and was evidently about to throw himself upon darke i * his arm and * him listen i said the house was surrounded by * * and * * darke had not drawn his pistol and now glanced at me his face was thin and * was * the shadow of * his eyes burned with a strange fire under his * * you are right colonel surry he said in his deep voice to me * your friend let no one * or they are dead the house is surrounded by a * of my cavalry you are a mile from all * you can make no resistance i am master of this house but i design to * no one sit down madam he added to his companion i wish to speak first the * followed each other rapidly the * * was cold and had something * in it the capture of the party before him seemed to be no part of his design all at once the voice of the strange woman was heard in the silence she quietly * the arm of georgia conway who had drawn back with an expression of supreme * and * * herself in a chair * cut some * of dust from her gray riding habit with a small * which she carried yes let us * she said with her eyes * upon georgia conway nothing can be more pleasant than these sweet family * judge conway glanced at the * with eyes full of sudden rage who are you madam he exclaimed who makes this * claim of belonging to my family i have already told you was the * reply of the woman and you sir exclaimed the old judge suddenly turning and * darke perhaps you too are a member of the conway family not exactly was the cold reply your name sir * davenant judge conway gazed at the * with * you that * the son of general * davenant yes i am the son of general * davenant of the confederate states * davenant whom you hate and * as a * and * i have come here tonight to relieve him of that * to tell you that it was i and not he who * your brother a moment if you please sir continued the * in the same low cold tone do not * me i beg i have little time and intend to be brief you believe that your brother george conway was put to death by general davenant here is the fact of the matter i saw him at * courthouse knew he had a large * of money on his person followed him attacked him * * with general * * which i had * come into possession of then i stole the * from the courthouse to prevent his * and sent to him on the day of his trial a full * of the murder * with my * that * he would not use he would not * his son for ten years he has chosen rather to labor under the * of murder than * the name of a * son whose character was wretched already and whom he believed dead that is what i came here tonight to say to you sir i am a * know * is a * to touch my hand * with every * and much crime but i am not entirely lost though i * * when i met him not long since even a dog will not turn and * the hand that has been kind to him i was a gentleman once and am a * fellow * there is something worse than crime in my * it is * and * you shall not continue to * my father he is innocent of that murder you have no right to continue your opposition to my brothers marriage with your daughter for he is not the son of the * of your brother i count for nothing in this i am not my fathers son or my brothers brother i am an * lost * as far as they are * it was to tell you this that i have come here * for that only * woman said judge conway pale and * at the * let her speak for herself said darke * i will do so with pleasure said the woman * but with an * * smile that smile * * was worse than any * of rage the glance she threw upon georgia conway was one of such profound if * * that it drove my hand to my * as though to grasp some * i will be brief continued the woman rising slowly and looking at georgia conway with that * smile general * has * a * little history i will * another and address myself more particularly to judge * dear uncle he does not or will not recognize me and i suppose i may have changed but that is not important i am none the less * conway you do not remember that young lady perhaps sir your proud conway blood has * from your memory the very fact of her former existence and yet she * * * is speaking to * herself in the midst of her dear family but to tell my little * will not take many minutes i was born here you remember uncle and grew up what is called * at * i fell in love with a young * with a * and as you and the rest opposed my marriage * * your consent i yielded to the * of mr * and * with him going to the north here we had a * i grew * and * * and he took his * by * without leaving me a * to recall his dear * then i met that * * we took a fancy to each other we became friends and soon afterward * to the south * in * here i made the acquaintance of general * he stands he fell * in love with * * hope will tell you * then attempted to murder me without * or

his hand * his * horse his head turned over his shoulder his face calm collected and full of that courage which nothing could break all at once a shell * from the federal battery and * close to the general * up the ground in a dozen places the horse of an officer at his side was mortally wounded by a * and fell beneath his * other * * * with hanging * cut by the * i was looking at general lee feeling certain that he must have been wounded he had escaped however not a * of his calm face had moved only as he turned his face over his shoulder in the direction of the battery i could see a sudden color rush to his cheeks and his eye flashed i should now like to go into a charge he said to stuart once after a disaster and i thought i read the same thought in his face at this moment but it was impossible he had no troops the entire line on the right of petersburg had been broken to pieces and general lee retired slowly to his * works near the city where a little skirmish line full of

until night and then retreat i will not describe that day this volume * its end and it is fortunate to describe at length those last days would be a terrible task to the writer lee * to the president that he was going to retreat that night and at the moment when the officers of the government hastily left richmond by the * railroad the army at petersburg began to retire did you witness what i describe reader what a * army of northern virginia or what was left of it rather * away amid darkness i sat my horse on the * road north of the appomattox near the city and looked at the ragged column which * by from the bridge over the river in the * i could see their faces there was not a * of * in them you would have said indeed that they * at being out of the * be once more on the march with lee riding his old * in front of his old * the * of a hundred battles still * * general lee stood at the forks of the road * his column he had said little during the day and said little now but his voice was as calm and * his eye as * as before this is a bad business colonel i had heard him say at the moment when the shell burst near him in the morning i heard but one other * which he made to the situation well colonel he said to an officer in his deep and * voice it has happened as i told them it would at richmond the line has been stretched until it has broken so over the * road leading up the northern bank of the appomattox in the direction of * the * of * * * like * the old army of northern virginia reduced to fifteen thousand men went forth still * into the night three hours afterward i was in richmond sent with a message for general ewell i had taken the last train which left for the capital and reached the city toward midnight the first person whom i saw was tom * who ran to meet me his face was pale but his * smile still * up the brave face come and wait on me my dear old friend he said i am to be married tonight and in a few words he informed me that * had * to have the ceremony performed before tom followed general lee * half an hour afterward i witnessed a singular spectacle that of a wedding past midnight in the midst of * confusion * * * scene a city about to fall into the hands of the * which the government and all its * had fled * * her part bravely the * cheeks were * * sweet smile was as * when i took an old friends privilege to kiss the smiling lips there was no * in them and her blue eyes were as brave as ever so tom and * were * i * upon them my * blessing it was a singular * it not reader but war is full of such i did not see tom again until i met him on the retreat and * have never seen her sweet face * heaven bless her an hour afterward i had delivered my message to general ewell who was already moving out with his small force to join lee they * across the bridges and disappeared for myself tired out i wrapped my * around me and * myself upon a sofa at the house of a friend * a little rest i was aroused toward * by a tremendous * and going to the window saw that the city was in flames the * had been caused doubtless by * up the * or the * in james river the * and bridges had been fired in * of the approach of the enemy it * me to * now unless i wished to be captured i had taken the * to provide myself with a horse from one of the government * the animal stood ready * behind the house i bade my * friends farewell and * rode through the streets of the devoted city toward the capitol amid * shell from the * * * and * flames i can not describe the scenes which followed they were terrible and would present a fit subject for the * of * fancy * of desperate characters breaking into the * and * of * * * * in the streets and * amid the * the state prison had * its * * and * * of the city its birds of the * now * and * * * and * held their * and * * in the streets * with * over all * the flames * * * black clouds of smoke * far away under the blue * of spring then from the capitol hill where i had taken my stand i saw by the early light a spectacle even more * of the enemy * the city they came on from charles city in a long blue column * a * infantry and * artillery and * rushed toward the * city where they were met by a huge crowd of * and * negroes and * suddenly a * near at hand * up to the hill in front of the exchange a column of negro cavalry with drawn * rushed on as they came they * and * was the * spectacle of all i remained looking at the * * with rage in my heart until the advance force of the enemy had reached the * of the capitol then i turned my horse and pursued by * * rode out of the western gate up grace street fifty * from st * i saw colonel * pass * * in black coat * * tall black hat and with two ladies leaning upon his arms ah gallant to the last i see i * to him as i rode by none but the brave * the fair the colonel smiled but made no reply a hundred yards farther i met little mr * * approaching in his hand he carried his * brought him by the gray woman at his breast * a * united states flag the little gentleman was radiant and exclaimed as he saw me what my dear colonel you are going to leave us come and * with * five oclock * my reply was not * i drew my * which movement mr * disappeared running at the corner of st * on his * followed a * and * * * save my * it is on fire i shall be a * * mr * i laughed aloud as the wretched creature rushed by * and * ten minutes afterward i was out of the city my last view of richmond was from * hill near the grave of stuart the spectacle before me was at once terrible and splendid the city was wrapped in a sea of flame a vast black cloud swept away to the far * a * roar came up from beneath those flames * around the white * enemys guns * * and the * were * with * * and * into the devoted city which had at last fallen a * to the federal arms a last * was to * my heart the sight before me was not enough i had turned my horse to ride * throwing a parting glance upon the city when suddenly the virginia flag * from the * of the capitol and the united states flag was run up i turned and shook my * hand at it that is not my flag and shall never be i exclaimed aloud and taking off my hat as i passed the grave of stuart i rode on thinking of the past and the present crossing james river above the city i pushed after the army which i * on the evening of the #* as it was crossing the appomattox opposite * courthouse it reached that village on * april #* and you could see at a glance that its spirit was * as to general lee his resolution up to that time had * all who saw him never had he seemed in more * spirits i have got my army safe out of its breastworks he said and in order to follow me my enemy must * his lines and can * no further benefit from his * or james river it was only the * who lost hope lee was not of those mounted upon his old * the head of his old army if his little * of about fifteen thousand men could be called * was still the great * the enemy had not yet * him his heart of hope was * he would cut his way through and the red flag should again * on * fields the army * to the feeling of its chief the confidence of the men in lee was as great as on his days of victory you would have said that the events of the last few days were in the * of the troops only * * the veterans of hill and longstreet advanced steadily * firm shoulder to shoulder with glittering gun * and faces as * and * as at manassas and chancellorsville those men are not * said a keen * to me as he looked at the * column moving and he was right the * of this * of the great army of northern virginia was * those who saw them then will * to the truth of my statement at * courthouse a terrible blow however awaited them general lee had ordered rations to be sent * from north carolina they had been sent but the trains had gone on and * them in richmond when lee arrived with his * army already * and faint not a * of bread or * was found there was nothing those who saw general lee at this moment will remember his expression for the first time the shadow of despair passed over that brave forehead some one had indeed struck a * at him his army was without food all his plans were * he had intended to * his force at * and then * straight on his plan i think i can state was to attack the * forces of grant in his front cut his way through there cross the * and other * by means of * which had been provided and forming a junction with general johnston crush sherman or retreat into the * states all this was however * by one wretched * incident the great * was to be arrested by an * in its path the rations were not found at * courthouse the army must have food or die half the force was * in * parties throughout the * country and the delay gave grant time to mass heavily in lees front at * then all was decided lee had not * his ability to crush a corps or even more before the main force of the enemy came up he saw as clearly now that there was no hope of his * his way through grants army it was there in his * failure of rations had caused all with what must have been a terrible weight upon his heart lee directed his march toward lynchburg determined to fight to the end and as he had said during the winter die sword in hand then commenced the * tragedy what words can * that retreat there is only one other that * * retreat from * the army * on fighting and * and dying * men fell by the * or dropped their * as they * on the wagons were drawn by * * without food like the soldiers if an ear of corn was found the men seized and * it * like * covered with mud * with * with * * and * eyes the old guard of the army of northern virginia still stood to their * at every step * but not * and * the orders of lee to the last you would not doubt that confidence in and love for their commander reader if you had witnessed the scene which i did near * the enemy had suddenly * ewell and custis lee and broken them to pieces the blue * and infantry pressing * on all sides and * their * to the death seemed at this moment to have delivered a blow from which the confederates could not rise the attack had fallen like a * ewell anderson and custis lee were swept away by mere weight of numbers the whole army seemed threatened with instant destruction lee suddenly appeared however and the scene which followed was * he had rushed a brigade across riding in front on his * and at that instant he * some * of the old age on the * of the * with head erect face * eyes clear and * he had reached the scene of danger and as the * * of ewells force crowded the hill hot and * they had suddenly seen rising between them and the enemy a wall of * * by cannon a great * should have been present then night had fallen and the * was * up by the * of burning wagons every instant rose sudden and * the enemys signal * on the * of the hill where the infantry waited lee rode among the * men of ewell and his presence raised a storm its general lee uncle robert * the man who wont follow old uncle robert such were the * * and fierce * the * faces flushed the * hands were * on all sides * of rage and * were heard the men called on the gray old * sitting his horse as calm as a * to take command of them and lead them against the enemy no attack was made on them an hour afterward the army moved * rear covered by general fitzhugh lee with his cavalry which at every step met the blue * pressing on to hunt down their * such were some of the scenes of the retreat up to the #* who has the heart to * what followed in the next two days a great army dying * fighting * a * spectacle i think the memory of it must * even the enemies who witnessed it it is only a small portion of the tragic picture that the present writer has the heart to * on the morning of the #* of april and throughout the #* the horrors of the retreat * the army was fighting at every step hope had deserted them but they were still fighting on every side pressed the enemy like * of * * down the wounded * gordon and longstreet commanding the two * corps of infantry and fitzhugh lee the two or three thousand cavalry remaining met the * * with a * which had in it something of the heroic fitz lee had commanded the rear guard on the whole retreat all along the route he had * the columns of sheridan and * them with heavy loss at * he had driven sheridan back * * and * two hundred of his men at * he captured seven hundred and * more * many among the rest the federal general read on the morning of the #* beyond the river he drove back a large column * general * * that was a brave resistance made by the old army of northern virginia reader as it was slowly advancing into the * of * beyond * there was no longer any hope all was plainly over i * from the picture but here is that of one of my friends it became necessary to burn * of wagons at * the enemys cavalry dashed in and struck the * train here or there * and burning * on * of wagons * of men dropped from * and thousands let fall their * from * to carry them any farther the scenes were of a nature which can be * in its * * only by men who are thoroughly familiar with the * details of war behind and on either flank a * and * * enemy every * and every rise in the road * with * wagons the air filled with the * reports of ammunition * and shell * when touched by the flames dense columns of smoke * to heaven from the burning and * * exhausted men * * and horses lying down side by side * * * * from * * eyes dead * dead horses dead men everywhere death many times * as gods blessing in * can wonder if many hearts tried in the fiery * of four * years and never * found * should have * in presence of * * * misery * for five or six days and * in * they did not * they fell it was not fear

up all in one sentence the army of northern virginia which had for four years * victory upon some of the * * of history fought * fired its last * and fell dead from * * * with its last breath * through blood in its throat the enemy who was * it down to its death call it what you will * was something in those men that made them fight to the last on the night of the #* of april within a few miles of appomattox courthouse took place the last council of war of the army of northern virginia it was in the open air beside a * near which were spread general lees * for throughout the retreat he had used no tent sleeping * like his men by the * fire to this last council of war none but the corps commanders were invited thus the only persons present were gordon and longstreet commanding the * corps of infantry and fitzhugh lee the cavalry of the army gordon was stretched near fitzhugh lee upon the * of the commanderinchief gordon with his clear * his * eyes his firm lip his dark hair and uniform coat * to his * man to fight and die rather than surrender near him lay fitz lee the * and laughing * with the * * the * eyes the * and cavalry * man to stand by gordon on a * a few feet distant sat the * longstreet * with perfect * heavily * face * no emotion whatever erect within a few * of these three men stood general * commanding * the * * every * of his vigorous person * in its plain gray uniform the gray * and * the * eyes and that stately * of the head upon the shoulders which seemed to mark this human being for command all these persons were composed their faces were * from want of rest but there was nothing in their * * anxiety though some gloom it was a picture for an * said that one of them who described the scene to me afterward the * light brought out every * of these * figures by that fire on the * had assembled for the last time general robert e lee and his corps commanders the council was brief general lee * laid before his * the whole situation his army was on a * of land between the james river and the enemy he could not cross the * he could not break through the enemy in his front the army was lost general grant had understood his situation and a correspondence had taken place he would read general grants notes and * of his own * by the light of the fire general lee then proceeded to read the papers * too grant had opened the correspondence the result of the last week must * general lee he wrote of the * of further resistance on the part of the army of northern virginia he therefore asked the surrender of that army to prevent * lee had written in reply * grant to state the terms grant had stated them on this #* of april and lee had replied at once that he did not intend to * the surrender of the army of northern virginia but to ask the terms of general grants proposition to be frank he had added i do not think the * has * to call for the surrender but he would meet general grant on the next morning to * the whole affair there the correspondence had * what was the opinion of his corps commanders their * were brief and * the scene was august but simple what was determined upon was this that the army should continue its march on the next day toward lynchburg breaking through * cavalry which was known to be in front but in case the federal infantry a very different thing from the cavalry was found to be up then gordon who was to lead the advance should * the commanderinchief of that fact when a flag of * would be sent to general grant * to the terms of * proposed in his last note to general lee fitzhugh lee only * that if he saw that the federal infantry in his front rendered surrender * he should be allowed to go off with his cavalry to save the horses of his men this was agreed to and it will be seen that fitz lee * himself of the * permission so ended that last council of war by the camp fire with grave * and a cordial pressure of the brave hands the famous soldiers took leave of lee as they disappeared he drew his * around him and fell asleep by the * fire it was the night of april #* #* years day for day from the moment when these lines are written throughout that strange night of the * of april 1865 i was in the saddle carrying orders those who saw it will remember how * brilliant it was the moon and stars shone the light clouds * across the sky scarcely * the mournful * all was still the two * surrounded and at bay the other ready to finish the work before * silently on their arms waiting for that day which would bring the thunder every * had been made by lee to break through the force in his front and gain lynchburg from which he could retreat to the * the column of infantry to open the way was about one thousand six hundred men under gordon the cavalry * two or three thousand was commanded by fitzhugh lee the artillery * of three or four * was placed under that brave spirit colonel thomas h carter for the * work lee had selected three * i saw them all that night and read in their eyes the fire of an * resolution you know those men reader if you do not history knows them it was their immense good fortune to bear the red cross * in the last charge on the enemy and with their * of * to drive the federal forces back nearly a mile half an hour before lees surrender i had just left general fitzhugh lee near appomattox courthouse and was riding through the pines when a * voice halted me who goes there said the voice surry * for i had recognized the voice of the general of cavalry we have seen little of him reader in this rapid narrative but in all the long hard battles from the rapidan to this night i had everywhere found myself thrown in * with the great * tried and * friend of my heart the army had * him on a hundred fields his name had become the * of * courage he was here on the * of surrender now looking as calm and * as on his days of victory well old friend said * * my hand and then leaning upon my shoulder as the * say what of the night bad * i understand you think the enemys infantry is up yes then well have hard work but we are used to that surry the work is nothing it is death only but something worse than death is coming * what surrender * shook his head i am not going to surrender he said i have * to one i love more than my * know whom i mean * i would come back or die sword in hand and i will keep my oath the proud face * in the * but fiery eyes i could read the expression of an * resolution another friend of ours has * that too he said who mohun and just married his poor young wife like yours is far from him you are mistaken she is near him she went ahead of the army and is now at the village here is it possible and where is mohun he is holding the advance skirmish line on the right of gordon look do you see that fire yonder * through the woods i left him there half an hour since i will go and see him do nothing * tomorrow * remember that poor old virginia if no one else needs you yet be * surry he replied with a cool smile farewell we shall meet at * and we parted with a pressure of the hand i rode toward the fire stretched on his * beside it i saw the figure of mohun he was reading in a small volume and did not * his head until i was within three * of him what are you reading mohun he rose and * my hand the only book for a soldier he said with his frank glance and brave * book of books my dear * which tells us to do our duty and trust to * i glanced at the volume and recognized it i had seen it in the hands of georgia conway at five forks on the * * which was open her name was written that is her bible i said and doubtless you have just parted with her yes i see you know that she is here not far from me * told me it must be a great delight to you mohun he smiled and sighed yes he replied but a sort of sorrow too why a sorrow mohun was silent then he said i think i shall fall tomorrow * i said trying to laugh why should you fancy such a thing i am not going to surrender surry i * to * my old comrade that i would never surrender and he * that to me he was killed in charles * kept his word i will not break mine friend my head sank i had taken my seat on * * and gazed in silence at the fire that is a terrible resolution mohun i said at length yes he replied with entire * especially in me it is hard to die even when we are old and * life is a burden men * to this miserable existence even when old age and grief have taken away one by one all the * of life think then what it must be to die in the * of youth and health and happiness i am young strong happy beyond words the person i love best in all the world has just given me her hand i have before me a long life of joy if i only live but i have * that oath surry * kept his shall i break mine let us not talk further of this friend and mohun changed the conversation * to listen to my * half an hour afterward i left him with a strange * of the heart taking my way back to the courthouse i passed through the little village rode on for a mile and then * by * lay down by a camp fire in the woods and fell asleep i was * by a single gun sending its * roar through the gray dawn rising i * my * around me mounted my horse and rode toward the front as i * the hill upon which stands appomattox courthouse a crimson * suddenly spread itself over the fields and woods i looked over my shoulder in the east on the * of the forest the * * sun was * like a great * * in blood such was the spectacle which * in the ninth of april 1865 at appomattox courthouse i rode on rapidly to the front it was the morning of the ninth of april 1865 since that time three years day for day nearly hour for hour have passed for these lines are written on the morning of the ninth of april # gordon had formed his line of battle across the road just beyond the * supported by fitzhugh lees cavalry and * artillery on his right was advancing with * steps to break through the enemy it was a spectacle to make the * * the little * was going to death * the red light of morning * from the * * of the infantry the * of the cavalry and the grim cannon following in * * gordon the * of the army was riding in front of his line the hour and the men had both come steadily the old guard of the army of northern virginia advanced to its last field of battle suddenly in front of them the woods * with the enemys infantry cavalry and artillery the great * had evidently employed the hours of night well grants entire army seemed to have * itself in * front but the force was not the question * one thousand six hundred men were in motion and when gordon moved forward he always fought if he found an enemy in five minutes the * had closed in in * fight and the woods * with * cannon and * then a * cheer rose the enemy had * before gordon and he pressed forward * every thing in his path for nearly a mile beyond the courthouse on his right fitzhugh lees * * forward on the * enemy and * guns advanced at a gallop taking * to the left and * to the right of the * which they opened a rapid fire upon the federal line of battle i had accompanied the advance and looked on with * wonder a * seemed about to be * before my very eyes * poor little * of less than two thousand men with the * * of fitzhugh lee on their * * seemed about to drive back the whole federal army and cut their way through in safety alas the hope was vain in front of the * were * thousand men it was not * cavalry * would have speedily been disposed of during the night general grants best infantry had pressed forward and arrived in time to place itself across lees path what gordon and fitzhugh lee encountered was the federal army right and left as in front were seen dense blue columns of infantry heavy * of cavalry * batteries from which issued at every instant that quick * which * the shell from this * a great * arose and was taken up by the federal troops for miles from the extreme rear where longstreet stood * * the * as from the front where gordon was trying to break through the immense * in his path came that thunder of cheers * clearly that the enemy at last felt that their * was in their * the * was brief the great federal wave which had rolled * before gordon now rolled forward to * him the moment seemed to have come for the old guard of the army of northern virginia to crown its * with a glorious death the federal line rushed on from end to end of the great field broken by woods the blue infantry delivered their fire as they advanced with wild cheers upon the line of gordon and lee the guns of carter * in vain never were cannon fought more * the enemy were now nearly at the * of the pieces gordon was everywhere * his men and * to hold them steady with * eyes his drawn sword waving amid the smoke his * voice rising above the * of battle gordon was * but all was of no * the federal line came on like a wave of * and fire a long * * mingled with the thunder of cannon * the ear above the * rose a huge * from which issued cheers and * suddenly an officer of general lees staff passed by like * was lost in the smoke then i saw him speaking to gordon at the few words uttered by the officer the latter turned pale a moment afterward a white flag * order to surrender had come what i felt at that instant i can not describe something seemed to * me i * aloud and turned toward the cavalry at fifty * from me i saw * surrounded by his officers and men his * face * eyes * near him general fitzhugh * tom * and some other members of his * sitting his horse pale and silent what will you do general said * * with drawn * fitzhugh lee uttered a * i dont wish to be * in the surrender he said come * go general lee no longer * my poor services * * again as general lee and his staff officers turned away well go out sword in hand * said let who will follow me a wild cheer greeted the words the men formed column and charged as they moved a second cheer was heard at fifty * from us i turned my head and saw mohun in front of about fifty * among whom i recognized nighthawk in an instant i was at * side you are going to charge i said and die surry a gentleman gives his word but once and following * with long * mohun and his * burst upon the enemy then was presented a spectacle which made the two armies hold their breath the column of cavalry under * and mohun had struck the federal line of battle for an instant you could see little hear little in the smoke and * a furious * * at least half of the * column and the rest were seen striking with their * at the blue infantry who * with their * at the * horses then a * * rose the smoke was swept away by the wind and made all clear * had cut his way through and was seen to * with a dozen * mohun shot through the breast and * with blood had fallen from the saddle his foot had caught in the * and he was dragged by his frightened animal toward the confederate lines the horse came on at a * gallop but suddenly a * came up with him seized the * and threw him * on his * the * was nighthawk * to the ground he seized the body of mohun in his arms * his foot from the * and * his own horse with the form of his master still clasped to his breast then * the * into his animal he turned to * but his last hour had come a * fired at fifty * * his back and the blood * he fell from the flying animal to the earth but his arms still clasped the body of mohun whose head lay upon his breast a loud cheer rose and the blue line rushed straight upon him * head rose and he gazed at them with * * he looked at mohun and * * his last remains of strength he drew from his breast a * and a piece of paper wrote some words upon the paper and * it to * breast this seemed to * him he had scarcely finished when his head sank his shoulders * and falling forward on the breast of mohun he * an hour afterward all was still on the * of the courthouse hill a blue column was * waving a large white flag general lee had surrendered lee had surrendered the army of northern virginia ask old soldiers of that army to describe their feelings at the * reader they will tell you that they can not and i will not attempt to record my own it was truly the bitterness of death that we * at ten oclock on the morning of that ninth of april 1865 at appomattox courthouse * soldiers cried like children it was hard to say whether they would have preferred at that moment to return to their families or to throw themselves upon the * of the enemy and die in that hour of their agony they were not * however the * of the enemy was * and * no * played no cheers were heard and general grant was the first to * * his * adversary who came with a single officer to * in a house near the field the terms of surrender they are known on the * they were carried out the men * the old * which they had carried in a hundred * surrendered the * colors which had waved over * fields and silently returned like * to their desolate homes two days after the surrender mohun was still alive three months afterward the welcome intelligence reached me that he was rapidly * he had made a narrow escape ten minutes after the death of the faithful nighthawk the federal line had swept over him and such was the agony of his wound that he exclaimed to one of the enemy take your pistol and * me the man * his * and * at his heart then he turned the * aside and * the pistol * it in its * no he said * * you might get well and * at the paper on * breast he passed on * its a general the paper saved * life an acquaintance in the federal army saw it and speedily had him * for an hour afterward his friends were informed of his * i hastened to the house to which he had been borne * over him the beautiful georgia was * * and * tears upon the paper which contained the words this is the body of general mohun * the army had surrendered the flag was * with a singular feeling of * and a lost feeling that is * i set out followed by my servant for * * i was the * of a paper which i still keep as a strange * the * ran this paper a * prisoner of the army of northern virginia has permission to go to his home and there remain * two horses at the top of this * was appomattox courthouse * april # 1865 on the * side was * prisoners pass so with his pass the * prisoner passed slowly across virginia to his home oh that virginia of #* desolate dreary land oh those poor sad soldiers returning to their homes everywhere burned houses * fields * * on all sides the * of the * and the sword the poor * prisoners going home * in that dark april felt a * which only a very bitter foe will laugh at but all was not taken honor was left * the * of home as the * * of the great army came back as they reached their old homes * their weary feet after them or * on their * horses suddenly the sunshine burst forth for them and * up their * with a sort of glory the wife the mother and the little child rushed to them hearts beat fast as the gray * were clasped in a long * those * of home loved the poor prisoners better in their dark days than in their bright the fond eyes * to tears the white arms held them close and the old soldiers who had only laughed at the roar of the enemys guns dropped tears on the faces of their * and little children in the autumn of last year # i set out on horseback from * * and following the route west by fredericksburg chancellorsville * ford culpeper and orleans reached the * in * i needed the sunshine and bright faces of the old * after that journey for at every step had * up some gloomy or * * it was a * journey through the world of memory fredericksburg chancellorsville the wilderness the * of * i rode on amid these * scenes a thousand memories came to * at the door of my heart some were gay if many were * mingled with the * but to return to the past is nearly always sad as i rode through the * land now it was with * head all the old days came back again the cannon sent their long * thunder through the * again the gray and blue lines closed in and * together again jackson in his old * coat stuart with his * * * * all whom i had known loved and still * rose before * line of august * * away into the night of the past once more i looked upon * holding in his arms the * form of * * only a desolate and dreary field now all the laughing faces and brave * of stuart and his men * the wilderness i saw jackson fight and fall saw him borne through the moonlight heard his * and his last * with stuart a step farther i passed the lonely old house in the wilderness and all the strange and * scenes there * up from the shadows of the past * * * * * * playing over again their fierce tragedy and to this was added the * * of may 1864 when general grant * the * death thus the journey which i made through the bare and deserted fields or the mournful * was not gay and these were only a part of the * which passed before me looking toward the south i saw as clearly with the eyes of the memory the banks of the * the * of the chickahominy the trenches at petersburg the woods of * five forks * courthouse nearer was yellow tavern where stuart had fallen not a foot of this soil of old virginia but seemed to have been the scene of some fierce battle some * tragedy well well i sighed as i rode on toward the * all that is buried in the past and it is useless to think of it i am only a poor * prisoner wearing arms no * me forget the red cross flag which used to * so * here and bow my head to the will of the supreme * of all * so i went on and in due time reached the * in * you recall the good old * do you not my dear reader i should be sorry to
