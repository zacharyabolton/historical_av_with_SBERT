on the part of the * * no * occasion for * he felt that he was * watched and resolved to give no ground for * yet during the long summer days when the intense heat prevented * from * the store and there was nothing to be done when russell knowing that the books were written up and the * free from * took his * * and * every * * he was not ignorant of the fact that an * * * his * * and understood why he was constantly interrupted to * most * * what the day denied him he * from night and succeeded in * a * knowledge of * besides reading several * books finding that his small * was * now that

hours remained for necessary sleep the * illness and death of an * and faithful servant together with * * * bringing the * * of * aid had prevented the prompt * of * due for the * cottage and russell was compelled to ask for a portion of his * in advance his mother little * of the struggle which took place in his heart ere he could force himself to make the request and he carefully concealed from her the fact that at the moment of receiving the money he laid in mr * hands by way of * the only article of any value which he * watch his father had always worn and which the * took from the * pocket of the dead * with blood the gold * had been sold long before and the son wore it attached to a simple black * his * received the watch locked it in the iron safe and russell fastened a small

russell * history such his situation at the beginning of his * year irene your father will be * if he * you in that * pray what is wrong about me now you seem to glory in finding fault what is the matter with my * as you call it you know very well your father cant bear to see you carrying your own * and basket to school he ordered * to take them every morning and evening but she says you will not let her carry them it is just * * in you there it is again because i dont choose to be * like a baby or made a * * of it is set down to * as if i had the * of a * see here aunt * i am tired of having * * * at my * as though i were a * child there is no reason in her walking after me when i am strong enough to carry my own books and i dont intend she shall do it any longer irene huntingdon stood on the marble steps of her * home and talked with the * aunt who * her fathers household the girl was about * tall for her age straight * slender the broad * hat * but by no means concealed her features and as she looked up at her aunt the sunshine fell upon a face of extraordinary beauty such as is rarely seen save in the * heads of the old * her eyes were * * beautiful they were larger than usual and of that rare * of * blue which * the white velvet * of a * when the eyes were * as on this occasion long * * of the * * of her hair rested against her brow save the scarlet lines which marked her lips her face was of that clear * which can be * only to the * * though there was an utter absence of the * * of health the * of the * seemed * of her * and * all thought of * miss * * something * in reply to her last remark and irene walked on to school her fathers residence was about a mile from the town but the * road rendered the walk somewhat longer and on one side of this road stood the small house occupied by mrs aubrey as irene approached it she saw electra grey coming from the opposite direction and at the cottage gate they met both paused irene held out her hand cordially good morning i have not seen you for a * i thought you were coming to school again as soon as you were strong enough no i am not going back to school why because * cant afford to send me any longer you know her eyes are growing worse every day and she is not able to take in * as she used to do i am sorry but it cant be helped how do you know it cant be helped russell told me he thought she had * on her eyes and they can be removed perhaps so if we had the means of * that celebrated physician in new orleans money * a great many things * but unfortunately we * it the trip would not cost much suppose you speak to russell about it much or little it will require more than we can possibly spare everything is so high we can * live as it is but i must go in my aunt is waiting for me they shook hands and irene walked on soon the * walls of the * rose grim and * and taking her place at the desk she applied herself to her books when school was * in the afternoon instead of returning home as usual she walked down the * street entered mr * store and put her books on the * it happened that the * stood near the front door and he came forward instantly to wait upon her ah miss irene happy to see you what shall i have the pleasure of showing you russell aubrey if you please the * * and she added i want some * * but russell can get them for me the young * stood at the desk in the rear of the store with his back toward the * and mr * called out here aubrey some * * for this young lady he laid down his pen and taking a box of * from the * placed it on the * before her he had not noticed her particularly and when she pushed back her hat and looked up at him he started slightly good evening miss huntingdon what number do you wish perhaps it was from the heat of the day or from * over his desk or perhaps it was from something else but his cheek was flushed and gradually it grew pale again russell i want to speak to you about electra she ought to be at school you know yes but she says your mother cant afford the * just now she cannot next year things will be better what is the * for her five dollars a month is that all he selected a delicate * pair of * and laid them before her while a faint smile passed over his face russell has anything happened what do you mean what is * you so nothing more than usual do those * suit you yes they will fit me i believe she looked at him very * he met her gaze steadily and for an instant his face * then she said * your mothers eyes are worse yes much worse have you * dr * about them he says he can do nothing for her how much would it cost to take her to new orleans and have that celebrated * examine them more than we can afford just now at least two hundred dollars oh russell that is not much would not mr * * you that little i shall not ask him not even to * your mothers sight not to buy my own life besides the * is a * one still it is worth making yes under different circumstances it certainly would be have you talked to mr campbell about it no because it is useless to * the matter it would be dangerous to go to new orleans now i suppose october or november would be better again she looked at him very earnestly then stretched out her little hand goodbye russell i wish i could do something to help you to make you less * he held the slight * fingers and his mouth trembled as he answered thank you miss huntingdon i am not * but my path in life is not quite so * as yours i wish you would not call me miss huntingdon in that * * way as if we were not friends or * it is a * that you desire me to address you as mr aubrey it sounds strange * to say anything but russell she gathered up her books took the * and went slowly * and russell returned to his desk with a light in his eyes which for the remainder of the day nothing could * as irene * the long hill on which mr * residence stood she saw her fathers buggy at the door and as she approached the steps he came out drawing on his * you are late irene what kept you i have been * a little are you going to ride take me with you going to * at mr * why the sun is almost down now what time will you come home i want to ask you something not till long after you are asleep the night passed very slowly irene looked at the * again and again finally the house became quiet and at last the crush of * on the * announced her fathers return he came into the library for a cigar and without * her drew his chair to the open window she approached and put her hand on his shoulder irene what is the matter child nothing sir only i want to ask you something well queen what is it he drew her tenderly to his knee and passed his hand over her * hair * huntingdon was forty years old tall spare with an erect and * carriage he had been * at west point and perhaps early education * somewhat to the air of * * which many found * his black hair was slightly * with grey and his features were still * handsome though the expression of mouth and eyes was * by no means * irene was his only child her mother had died during her * and on this beautiful * he * all the tenderness of which his nature was * his * were * his house was * and complete and furnished * every * that money could yield him he possessed yet there were times when he seemed * and * and no one could * the cause of his gloom the girl looked up at him * no * father i wish please you would give me two hundred dollars what would you do with it queen i do not want it for myself i should like to have that much to enable a poor woman to recover her sight she has * on her eyes and there is a physician in new orleans who can relieve her father wont you give me the money he took the cigar from his lips shook off the ashes and asked * what is the womans name has she no husband to take care of her mrs aubrey she what the cigar fell from his fingers he put her from his knee and rose instantly his * cheek * and she wondered at the expression of his eyes so different from anything she had ever seen there before who gave you permission to visit that house no permission was necessary i go there because i love her and electra and because i like russell why * i go there sir is * * irene mark me you are to visit that house no more in future keep away from the whole family i will have no such association never let me hear their names again go to bed give me one good reason and i will obey you reason my will my command is sufficient reason what do you mean by * me in this way * * is your duty the calm holy eyes looked * into his and as he marked the startled expression of the girls pure face his own eyes * father has mrs aubrey ever * you no answer if she has not you are very * to her if she has remember she is a woman bowed down with many * and it is * to * up old * father please give me that money i will * my last * in the red sea first now are you answered she put her hands over her eyes as if to shut out some painful vision and he saw the slight form * in perfect silence she took her books and went up to her room mr huntingdon * himself as the door closed behind her and the * showed a * smile * over his dark features he sat there * out into the * night and seeing by the * of the * moon only the graceful form and lovely face of * aubrey as she had appeared to him in other days could he forget the hour when she * her cold fingers from his * and in * of her fathers wishes * she would never be his wife no * was sweet very sweet his heart had * with * when the * of death upon the * was pronounced upon the husband of her choice and now her * her * her * gave him deep * joy the history of the past was a * volume to his daughter but she was now for the first time conscious that her father regarded the widow and her son with * * and with strange * dread she looked into the future knowing that * was no part of his nature that * or * was never forgotten whether the general rule of * * to * * admitted of no * was a * which irene * * and on saturday as soon as her father and cousin had started to the plantation twentyfive miles distant she put on her hat and walked to town * absorbed in * * she hurried along the * ran up a flight of steps and * at a door on which was written in large * letters dr * ah beauty come in sit down and tell me what brought you to town so early he was probably a man of fifty * in appearance and * a * his thick hair was * so was the heavy * and the * grey * slowly * as he took his visitors little hands and looked kindly down into her grave face from her * he had * and * her and she stood as little in * of him as of * doctor are you busy this morning i am never too busy to attend to you little one what is it of course you know that mrs aubrey is almost blind of course i do having been her physician those * can be removed however perhaps they can and perhaps they cant but the * are that a good * can relieve her i rather think so two hundred dollars would * all the * of a trip to new orleans for this purpose but she is too poor to afford it * too poor his grey eyes * * but he would not * her dr * dont you think you could spare that small * without much * really is that what you * into town for yes i have not the necessary amount at my * just now and i came to ask you to * it to me do you want the money now yes if you please but before you give it to me i ought to tell you that i want the matter kept secret no one is to know anything about * even my father she looked so * that for a moment he felt * i knew mrs aubrey before her marriage he bent forward to watch the effect of his words but if she really knew or * * of the past there was not the * * of it putting back her hair she looked up and answered that should * your * to aid her in her * hold out your hand fifty one hundred a hundred and fifty two hundred there will that do thank you thank you you will not need it soon i hope not until you are ready to pay me dr * you have given me a great deal of * than i can express i dont try to express it queen you have given me * more i assure you her splendid eyes were lifted toward him and with some sudden * she touched her lips to the hand he had placed on her shoulder something like a * crossed the * * stern mouth as he looked at the * beauty of the girls countenance and he kissed her slender fingers as * as though he touched something * irene shall i take you home in my buggy no thank you i would rather walk oh doctor i am so much obliged to you in answer to * * electra opened the cottage door and * her into the small room which served as both * and diningroom everything was * * not a spot on the bare * floor not a * to dim the * of the * * * and on the table in the centre stood a * filled with fresh * flowers in a low chair before the open window sat the widow * a blue and white * she glanced round as irene entered who is it electra miss irene aunt sit down miss irene how are you today mrs aubrey i am sorry to hear your eyes are no

could command the means you have the means you must * them there i will not take back the money it is yours dont refuse it * you will wound * * electra there was silence for a few * then mrs aubrey took the hands from her face and * i will accept your generous offer if my sight is restored i can * you some day if not i am not too proud to be under this great * to you oh irene i cant tell you how much i thank you my heart is too full for words she threw her arm round the girls * and * her to her bosom and the hot tears fell fast on the waves of golden hair a moment after irene threw a * * into

dont * to accept it if you really love thinking of the group she had just left irene approached the gate and saw that russell stood holding it open for her to pass looking up she stopped for the expression of his face frightened and * her russell what is the matter oh tell me i have been * and * just now i doubt all people and all things even the justice and mercy of god russell shall not the * judge of all the earth do right shall the rich and the * * * upon the poor and the unfortunate who has * you a * man who passes for a christian who * pale at the sound of a * who * to * * and *

will you do russell i dont know yet oh if i could only help you she clasped her hands over her heart and for the first time since her * tears rushed down her cheeks it was painful to see that quiet girl so moved and russell hastily took the folded hands in his and bent his face close to hers irene the only comfort i have is that you are my friend dont let them influence you against me no matter what you may hear believe in me oh irene irene believe in me always he held her hands in a * so * that it * her then suddenly dropped them and left her mrs aubrey recognized the step and looked round in surprise electra i certainly hear russell coming he drew near and touched her cheek with his lips saying tenderly how is my mother russell what * you home so early that is rather a cold welcome mother but i am not * can you bear to hear something * here put your hands in mine now listen to me you know i drew fifty dollars of my * in advance to pay * at that time i gave my watch to mr * by way of * he seemed so * to let me have the money you understand mother why i did not mention it at the time he locked it up in the iron safe to which no one has * except him and myself late yesterday i locked the safe as usual but do not remember whether the watch was still there or not this morning mr * * it we * safe desk store could find it * nor the * gold piece * at the same time no other money was * though the safe contained nearly a thousand dollars the end of it all is that i am * as the * and * in * for a low * cry escaped the * lips and her head sank heavily on the boys shoulder passing his arm * around her he kissed her white face and continued in the same * * tone like one speaking under his breath and * some * rage mother i need not assure you of my * you know that i never could be * of what is * to me but not having it in my power to prove my * i shall have to suffer the * for a season only for a season i trust mother for in time the truth must be discovered i have been turned out of my situation and though they have no proof of my * they will try to * me with the * for a few moments deep silence * in the little * and only the * eye * the heart of the * * when she raised her head from the boys bosom the face though * was * and pressing her lips twice to his she said slowly beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened * you for whom the lord * he * and * every son whom he * i will wait * my son hoping for * which shall * the world of your * i wish i could take the whole burden on my shoulders and relieve you my dear boy you have mother it * to crush me now that you are yourself once more he spoke with difficulty however as if something * him and rising hastily poured out and * a glass of water and now russell sit down and let me tell you a little that is pleasant and * there is still a bright spot left to look upon * her hand into his the mother informed him of all that had occurred during * visit and * by * the money in his * electra sat opposite watching the change that came over the face she loved best on earth her large eager midnight eyes noted the quick * and glad light which * his features the deep joy that * in his * soul and * she * her fingers till the * grew purple as though * to * some * object * itself before her her * became * and painful her gaze more * and * and when her cousin exclaimed oh mother she is an angel i have always known it she is * everybody else * heart seemed to stand still and from that moment a * * fell between the girls eyes and gods sunshine she rose and a silent yet terrible struggle took place in her passionate soul justice and * * * she would be just though every star fell from her sky and with a quick * step she reached russell thrust * note into his fingers and fled into solitude an hour later russell * at the door of an office which bore on a square * * these words robert campbell * at law the door was partially closed and as he entered an * man looked up from a desk covered with * papers and open * from which he was evidently making * the thin hair hung over his forehead as if restless fingers had * * through it and as he kept one finger on a * * the cold blue eye said very plainly this is a busy time with me despatch your * at once good morning mr campbell are you particularly engaged * aubrey i am generally engaged * busy this morning what do you want his pen resumed its work but he turned his head as if to listen i will call again when you are at * said russell turning away that will * * year in fine * your visit * sit * those books into a corner and * hear your business i am at your service for ten * fast he put his pen behind his ear crossed his arms on the desk and looked * i came here to ask whether you wished to * * in your office and what the * do you suppose i want with an office * like yourself i tried that * to my perfect satisfaction a few months ago is that all that is all sir the boy rose but the bitter look that crossed his face as he glanced at the * * arrested the * attention and he added why did you leave * young man it is a bad plan to change about in this style i was * from my situation on a * and most * * * hear the whole business sit down without * he * all the circumstances once or twice * to still the * of * that flashed from his eyes while he spoke mr * keen eyes * him from head to foot and at the conclusion he said i see fate has * none of your original * out of you aubrey suppose i shut my eyes to the watch * and take you into my office if so i shall do my duty faithfully but you said you did not need * here and though i am anxious to find work i do not expect or desire to be taken in from charity i intend to * my * sir and from your own account i should judge you had very little use for an * * a * share of pride along with * * though i am a * i told you the truth i have no earthly use for such * as i have been * with for several years in the main * are a * * only to the * of * i * my hands of the whole * months since but if i could only get an * * * * young man he would be a help to me i had * of finding such but on the whole i rather like you believe you can suit me exactly if you will and i am disposed to give you a trial sit down here and copy this * let me see what sort of * i shall have to * if i make you my * russell silently * and after a careful examination it seemed the * was * aubrey you and i can work * together i value your * i like your resolution come to me on monday and in the matter of * you shall find me * enough i think you told me you had a cousin as well as your mother to support i shall not forget it now good morning and leave me unless you desire to * work for yourself from early childhood irene had * a * of * doubtless the loss of her mother * this feeling but the * of her mental organization would have * it even under * * miss * considered her a strange little thing and rarely * with her plans in any respect while her father seemed to take it for granted that she required no looking after he knew that her beauty was extraordinary he was proud of the fact and having provided her with a good music master and sent her to the best school in the county he left her to * her * as * * occasionally her will * with his and more than once he found it impossible to make her yield * to his wishes to the * * of * and respect she submitted but whenever these * occurred he felt that in the end she was * * as it may appear though * for the time by her * he loved her the more for her * as he * it and * and * though he certainly was in many * he stood somewhat in * of his * * child his ward and * * * had * with him for several years and it was well known that mr huntingdon had * his daughters hand to his sisters son irene had never been * * of her * but * very * the true state of the case between the two cousins there existed not the * * of taste or * not a * * save the * of * on her part there was a * share of * affection on his as much love and tenderness as his * nature was * of feeling they rarely * as most children do for when as frequently happened he * into a rage and tried to * she * to * in any way and generally locked him out of the library what she thought of her fathers * concerning herself no one knew she never * to the subject and if in a * * * * it she * cut the discussion short when he went to college in a distant state she felt * relieved and during his * * herself as much as possible yet the girls heart was warm and * she loved her father * and loved most * electra grey whom she had first met at school they were nearly the same age * and firm friends as * different in character as appearance was electra grey rather * and much * than irene with shining * black hair large sad * black eyes from which there was no escape a pale * * and full crimson lips that rarely smiled electra was a * * * * because she could never * that * world which her busy brain kept constantly before her * love of drawing had early * itself first in strange * figures on her * then in her * on every * of paper which she could lay her hands upon and finally for want of more * material she * all over the walls of the little * to the great horror of her aunt who spread a coat of * over the childs * and begged her to be * of no such conduct in future as mr * might with great justice * for * in utter * electra retreated to the garden and here after a * had left the * * white and * she would * a bit of pine and draw figures and faces of all * and * * * to find her thus engaged one sunday afternoon russell * her with a * of * and * so long as these * she was perfectly happy but * their * circumstances admitted of no such * and before many weeks she was again without * she would not tell russell that she had exhausted his * and passed * nights trying to * some * by which she could aid herself it was * * for her to sit in school and see the * go round giving * on this side and that * over her every time because her aunt could not afford the * three dollars amid all these * and * she turned constantly to russell with a * love that knew no * she loved her * affectionate aunt as well as most * love their mothers and did all in her power to * her * but her affection for russell * on * in a character so * and passionate as hers there is * much of * and thus it came to pass that on the day of * visit to the cottage the horrible * took possession of her that he loved irene better than herself true she was very young but childish hearts feel as * as those of * years and electra * more agony during that day than in all her past life had irene been other than she was in every respect she would probably have * her cordially as matters stood she buried the * deep in her own heart and kept as much out of * way as possible days and weeks passed very * she * herself with her * and when the * had been * drew all over the * a hand there an entire arm now and then a face * as fate mrs * eyes became so * that finally she could not leave the house without having some one to guide her and as cold weather had now arrived preparations were made for her journey mr hill who was going to new orleans kindly offered to take charge of her and the day of departure was fixed electra * the little trunk saw it * on the top of the stage in the dawn of an october morning saw her aunt * seated beside mr hill and in another moment all had * in the afternoon of that day on returning from school electra went to the * and * a * took out a small paper box it contained a * of her father set in a handsome gold frame she knew it had been her mothers most * * her aunt had carefully kept it for her and as often as the * * her she had * but now the * for money * over every other feeling having touched the spring she took a * and * removed the bit of * beneath the glass then * the two last in the box put the gold frame in her pocket and went out to a * store as several persons had * her she leaned against the * and while waiting watched with some curiosity the movements of one of the * who with a glass over one eye was engaged in * * some had been taken from the cases others were * and as her eyes passed * over the latter they were suddenly * to a * gold one lying somewhat apart a * * caused the * to turn round and look at her but in an instant she * herself and thinking it a mere * of * he resumed his * just then one of the * approached and said * i am sorry we have kept you waiting miss what can i do for you what is this worth she laid the * down on the * and looked up with eyes that * very * he thought he * it a moment and said rather * well how do i know in the first place that it * to you * have to be very particular about what they buy she * and drew herself * away from the * then smiled and held out her hand for the * it is mine it held my fathers * but i took it out because i want a * and thought i could * this case for enough to buy one it was my mothers once here are her * on the back h * grey but of course you dont know whether i am telling the truth i will bring my cousin with me he can prove it sir are you so particular about everything you buy we try to be again her eyes * she bowed and left the store once in the street she hurried to mr * office ran up the steps and * * at the door come in * the * she stopped on the * glanced round and said * i want to see russell if you please russell is at the * have you any particular spite at my door that you * it in that style or do you suppose i am as * as a * i beg your pardon i did not mean to * you sir i was not thinking of either you or your door she sprang down the steps to wait on the * for her cousin and met him at the entrance oh russell i have found your watch a * of light seemed to * from his eyes as he seized her hand where at mr * * store thank god he went up the * delivered the letters and came back accompanied by mr campbell this is my cousin electra grey mr campbell so i * from the * assault she made on my door just now however shake hands little lady it seems there is some reason for your haste * hear about this precious watch business she simply told what she had seen presently russell said but how did you * there electra your good angel sent me i suppose and she added in a * i will tell you some other time on * the store she walked at once to the * corner and pointed out the watch yes it is mine i would know it among a thousand how can you * it aubrey he immediately gave the number and name of the * and described the * * not * the * of * mr campbell turned to the * the same gentleman with whom electra had * and * * the circumstances which had occurred in connection with the watch mr brown listened * then requested russell to point out the particular one that * his he did so and on examination the number date name and all the * * so exactly that no doubt remained on the * mind young man this watch was sold for * dollars by a man named * * who lives in new orleans no # street i will write to him at once and find out if possible how it came into his possession i rather think he had some horses here for * did he wear green * * russell of the young man who had * the watch yes and had one arm in a * i saw such a man here about the time my watch was * after some * from mr campbell concerning the proper course to be pursued electra drew out her * saying now russell is not this * mine yes but where is the * what are you going to do with it the * is at home but i want to * the frame and mr brown does not know but that it is another watch case if it is necessary i will * that it * * to you but what do you want to * it for i should think you would * it too * to be willing to part with it i do * the * and

of the old house * from view and knew that many months perhaps years must * before the * trees of the long avenue would wave again over the head of their young mistress her father sat beside her * and

when she should be * of his aid and advice though their acquaintance had been so short a * strong feeling had grown up in her heart toward him a feeling of * tenderness * with earnest and * gratitude she knew that he understood her character and * her * and it * her fierce proud heart in some degree to receive from him those * of constant * which she so * to have from russell she felt too that she was not regarded as a stranger by the * she could see his sad eyes * at her entrance and * the * in his hand and voice when he spoke of going home his health had * and the heat of summer had come why did he * his * were often spent at the cottage and even mrs aubrey learned to smile at the sound of his step one morning as electra finished her * and rose to go he said slowly as if watching the effect of his words this is the last hour i can give you in two days i return to new york letters of importance came this morning i have waited here too long already are you in earnest this time i am it is absolutely necessary that i should return home mr * what shall i do without you suppose you had never seen me then i should not have had to lose you oh sir i need you very much electra child you will * your difficulties without assistance from * you have nothing to fear yes i know i shall * at last but the way would be so much * if you were only with me i shall miss you more than i can tell you he passed his hand over his short shining hair and * for a moment as if * * * in the * she heard his deep * * and saw the working of the * in his pale face when he spoke his voice was * you are right you need me and i want you always with me we must not be parted electra i say we shall not come to me put your hands in * me that you will be my child my * i will take you to my mother and we need never be separated you require aid such as cannot be had here in new york you shall have all that you want will you come with me he held her hands in a * grasp and looked * into her * countenance a * gathered before her and she closed her eyes electra will you come she raised her * face * with stern * and ere the words were pronounced he read his answer in the * * of her eyes in the hard * lines of the mouth mr * i cannot go with you just now for at present i cannot ought not to leave my aunt helpless as she is it would be cruel * to * her but things cannot continue this way much longer and i promise you that as soon as i can i will go to you i want to be with you i want somebody to care for me and i know you will be a kind friend to me always most * will i accept your generous offer as soon as i feel that i can do so he stooped and touched her forehead with his lips my dear electra you are right to remain with her but when she needs you no more i shall expect you to come to me in new york * i shall write to you frequently and supply you with such books and * as you require my * i long to have you in my own home remember no matter what * you have promised yourself to me i shall not forget but he saw her * shall i speak to your aunt about this matter before i go no it would only distress her leave it all with me it is late and i must go goodbye sir he promised to see her again before his departure and she walked home with her head bowed and a sharp * pain * at her heart in the calm peaceful years of ordinary childhood the soul * slowly but a * nature like * * to * trials rapidly * and * every * with the * ring of age keen * to joy or pain taught her early that less * characters are years in * and it was * true that while yet a mere girl she suffered as * as a woman russell knew that a change had come over his cousin but was too constantly engaged too entirely absorbed by his * to ask or * the cause she never watched at the gate for him now never sprang with * arms to meet him never hung over the back of his chair and * his hands as formerly when not waiting upon her aunt she was as * upon her books as he and though * kind and * in her conduct toward him she was evidently * in his presence as the summer wore on mrs * health failed rapidly and she was confined to her * one morning when mr campbell the * had spent some time in the * praying with the * and * the * of the * supper electra followed him to the door leaving russell with his mother the gentle * took her hand kindly and looked at her with * eyes you think my aunt is worse yes my child i think that very soon she will be with her god she will scarcely * till night she turned * from him and threw herself down across the foot of the bed * her face in her arms russell sat with his mothers hands in his while she turned her brown eyes toward him and * him to * himself and his future to the hands of a * god electra was not forgotten she advised her to go to a cousin of her mother * in virginia long before she had written to this lady * her of her own * and of the girls helpless condition and a kind answer had been returned cordially * the orphan to share her home to become an * of her house russell could take her to these relatives as soon as possible to all this no reply was made and a few moments later when russell kissed her tenderly and raised her pillow she said * if i could look upon your face once more my son it would not be hard to die let me see you in heaven my dear dear boy these were the last words and soon after a * fell upon her hour after hour passed mrs campbell came and sat beside the bed and the three remained silent now and then * bowed heads to look at the * the autumn day died slowly as the widow and when the * * out the sunset hour russell rose and putting back the window * stooped and laid his face close to his mothers no * * the folds over the heart or the soft * of hair on the * * the still mouth had breathed its last sigh and the * brown eyes had opened in * the day bore her away on its wings and as russell touched the * cheek a * cry rolled through the silent cottage oh mother my own precious dead mother falling on his knees he laid his head on her pillow and when kind friendly hands bore her into the * room he * there still * of what passed knowing only that the * of many * had fallen that the last and * * of * had been * at the window stood electra pressing her face against the frame looking out into the * * night * to read the * characters * * on the * * clouds as the reckless winds parted their * folds she * away from the window and approached her cousin oh russell say something to me or i shall die it was the last * she ever suffered to escape her in his presence he raised his head and put his hand on her forehead but the trembling lips refused their office and as she looked up at him tears rolled slowly down and fell on her cheek she would have given * to * her tears with his but no * came to her burning eyes and there these two soon to separate passed the remaining hours of that long wretched night of watching the * day lifted her pale mournful face at last and with it came the dreary * and * of autumn rain making it * * to * the precious form to its long last * electra stood up beside her cousin and folded her arms together russell i am not going to that cousin in virginia i could * my bread and clothes to you but not to her she has children and i do not intend to live on her charity i know you and i must part the sooner the better i would not be willing to burden you a day longer i am going to fit myself to work * mr * offered me a home in his house said his mother was lonely and would be * to have me that letter which i received last week contained one from her also * me to come and russell i am going to new york to study with him as long as i need * i did not tell aunt of this because i knew it would * her to think that i would be thrown with strangers and having fully determined to take this step thought it best not to distress her by any * to it you know it is my own affair and i can decide it better than * else so you prefer utter strangers to your relatives and friends * of blood are not the * strangers step in to aid where relatives sometimes stand * and watch a fatal struggle remember irene who is nearer to you she or your grandfather such a friend mr * is to me and go to him i will at all * drop the subject if you please he looked at her an instant then turned once more to his mothers face and his cousin left them together the day was so * that only mr and mrs campbell and * * attended the funeral these few followed the gentle * and laid her down to rest till the star of * * and the storm * a long * * as the * * rose above the coffin the * * and his wife urged the * to remove to their house for a few days at least until the future could be * but they preferred to meet and battle at once with the * which they knew stood waiting in the desolate cottage at midnight a heavy sleep fell on russell who had thrown himself upon his mothers * and softly * a shawl over him electra sat down by the dying fire on the * * and looked her future in the face a few days * to prepare for her journey and a gentleman from new york who had met her cousin in mr * office * to take charge of her and * her to mr * hands the * furniture was sent to an * and a piece of board * to the * announced that the cottage was for * russell decided to take his * at a * and occupy a small room over the office which mr campbell had placed at his * on the same day the cousins bade * to the only spot they had called home for many years and as russell locked the door and joined electra his melancholy face expressed far better than words could have done the pain it cost him

your face my little sister ah sir i am so weary of that school you dont know what a relief it is to come here it is rather natural that you should feel * it is a fierce * for a child like you to be thrust so far from home i am not * now i believe i have in some degree become accustomed to the separation from my father but i am growing so different from what i used to be so different from what i expected it * me to know that i am * for the worse but * i cant help it i make good resolutions in the morning before i leave my room and by noon i * to break all of them the girls try me and i lose my patience when i am at home nothing of this kind ever * me miss irene yours is not a * * * if i have * understood your character you have never been accustomed to * upon others after * on yourself so long why yield to * now with years should grow the power the determination to do the work you find laid out for you it is * because i know how very * i have * myself thus far that i have no confidence in my own powers for future * either i have lived alone too long or else not long enough i rather think the last if they had only suffered me to act as i wished i should have been so much better at home oh sir i am not the girl i was eight months ago i knew how it would be when they sent me here some * cloud seems * over your future what is it you ought to be a * girl full of happy hopes she sank farther back in her chair to escape his * gaze and * her face lower yes yes i know i ought but people cant always shut their eyes shut their eyes to what various coming * mr young his lip * slightly and * the book on the table he said as if speaking rather to himself than to her the heart * his own bitterness and a stranger * not * with his joy you are not a stranger sir i see you are disposed to consider me such i thought i was your brother but no matter after a time all will be well she looked * and as the * * them he merely added i do not wonder you are a * child but you will soon learn to understand me you will come to me with all your * during the remainder of this visit she saw him no more * recovered rapidly and when she asked for her brother on * evening mrs young said he was to * twice that day monday morning arrived and irene returned to school with a heavy heart * that she had wounded him but a few days after * brought her a book and brief note of kind words one saturday morning she sat quite alone in her small room the week had been * painful and * in soul the girl laid her head down on her folded arms and thought of her home in the far south a loud * startled her from this painful * and ere she could utter the * come in * sprang to her side i have come for you irene have obtained permission from dr for you to accompany us to the * of design

pictures others occupied the * and * * now the * now the crowd furnished with a * the girls moved slowly on while mr young pointed out the prominent * or * of the works exhibited they made the * of the room and began a second * when their attention was attracted by a girl who stood in one corner with her hands clasped behind her she was * very * on an * and though her face was turned toward the wall the * * most unusual interest irene looked at her an instant and held her breath she had seen only one other head which * * knew the * waving hair and * up to her she exclaimed electra electra grey the orphan turned and they were locked in a * * oh * i am so glad to see you i have been here so long and looked for you so often that i had almost * whenever i walk down * whenever i go out * i

kindness soon after they reached home * was called into the * to see a young friend and as mrs young was absent irene found it rather lonely upstairs she thought of a new volume of * which she had noticed on the * as they entered and started down to get it about * of the flight of steps she caught her foot in the * where one of the * * to be * and * her efforts to grasp the * fell to the floor of the hall * one arm under her the * was thrown open instantly and the minister came out she lay * and he bent over her irene where are you hurt speak to me he raised her in his arms and placed her on the sofa in the * the motion produced great pain and she * and shut her eyes a * * containing some exquisite * stood on his mothers * and * a portion of its contents in his * he * her forehead *

first time played with the * he had so often before been * to touch she looked so slight so childish with her head * against the pillow that he forgot she was almost * forgot everything but the beauty of her pale face and bent over her with an expression of the * love she was suffering too much to notice his countenance and only felt that he was very kind and gentle mrs young came in very soon and heard with the * * of what had occurred irene again requested to be taken to the school * that she would cause too much trouble during her long * to the house but mrs young stopped her * with * and would listen to no such arrangements she would trust to no one but herself to nurse the * southern * having seen that all was in * she insisted on carrying her guest to the room * * and opening into her own mr young had gone to boston the day before and turning to her son she said * as your father is away you must take irene upstairs i am not strong enough be careful that you do not hurt her she led the way and * down he whispered my little sister put this * arm around my neck * i shall carry you as easily as if you were in a * he held her firmly and as he bore her up the steps the white face lay on his bosom and the golden hair floated against his cheek if she had looked at him then she would have seen more than he intended that * should know for young and free from * though she was it was impossible to mistake the expression of the eyes * upon her mrs young wrote immediately to mr huntingdon and explained the circumstances which had made his daughter her guest for some weeks at least * him that he need * no * whatever on her account as she would nurse her as tenderly as a mother could * by the * irene took little notice of what passed except when * by the pain * upon * the * * went to school as usual but her mother rarely left their guest and after mr * return he treated her with all the affectionate consideration of a * several days after the * of the accident irene turned toward the minister who stood talking to his mother your constant kindness * me to ask a * of you which i think you will scarcely deny me i am very anxious to see the friend whom i so * met at

so glad to find you out but where have you been all this time where did robert die she held the * hand and made no attempt to * the tears that rolled over her cheeks electra gave her a * account of

existence oh electra you shall have no more sorrow that we can * you from i loved your father very * and i shall love his orphan quite as * come to me let me be your mother let me * the wrong of *

was * though glad to meet with her fathers family she knew better than they that this * could make little * in her life and therefore when mrs young had left the room to * her husband and son with the discovery she had made electra sat down beside her friends sofa just as she would have done two hours before i am so glad for your sake that you are to come and live here until you know them all as well as i do you cannot * appreciate your good fortune said irene raising herself on her * yes i am very glad to meet my aunt returned electra * and then she added earnestly i dont know that i ought to talk about things that should have been buried before you were born but you probably know something of what happened we found out after you left why you were so suddenly sent off to * and you can

no i am * tonight i believe that is all he opened the * of which she was particularly fond and began to read for a while she listened and in her interest forgot her * but after a time her long * * swept her cheeks and she slept the minister laid down the volume and watched the pure * face noted all its * * and thought of the * which it would win her in coming years he knew as he sat watching her * that he loved her above everything on earth that she * a power none had ever possessed * his heart was * * with hers he had * with this * had stationed himself on the * of common sense and * at

irene remained at the hotel until the morning of her cousins departure a private * * the room she occupied and here he came to say farewell she knew that he had already had a long conversation with her father and as he threw himself on the sofa and seized one of her hands she * * from him irene here is my * i wanted you to ask for it but i see that you wont do it i know very well that you will

dearest little cousin goodbye think of me now and then and learn to love me by the time i come home she suffered him to take both her hands and kiss her tenderly for her father stood there and she could not refuse but the touch of his lips burned her long after he was gone she put on her * and when her father returned from the steamer they entered the carriage which was to * her to the dreary * school as they rolled along * mr huntingdon * took her hand and placed * ring upon it saying * * told me you refused to accept his parting * and seemed much hurt about it there is no reason why you should not wear it and in future i do not wish to see you without it remember this my daughter father it is wrong for me to wear it unless i expected to i understand the whole matter perfectly now irene let me hear no more about it i wish you would learn that it is a childs duty to obey her * no more words if you please on the subject she felt that this was not the hour for resistance and * * but he saw * written in the calm fixed eye and read it in the * lines of the full upper lip she had * him to take her home and only the night before renewed her * but his * was * and now she went back to the * school without a visible * of regret she saw her * * to the porter listened to a brief conversation between dr and her father and after a * * and * words watched the tall * form * the carriage then she went slowly up the broad * to her * room and with dry eyes * her clothes locked up the ring in her * and prepared to * her * it was late october a feeble flame * in the * on the * * an english * * closer as the heat died out and the * light of day gradually * leaving the room * save where a * line of yellow * down from the roof and * the folds of black silk at one of the windows stood electra half concealed by the heavy green and gold * one * hand * to the * the other pressed against the * as she watched the * * along the street below for three weeks she had received no letter from russell he was * * and this long * * filled her at first with * * which grew finally into horrible * for ten days she had stood at this hour at the same window waiting for mr * return from the * ten times the words no letter had fallen like the voice of * on her * heart on this * day * reached its * and time seemed to have locked its * to * her * at last an * stopped and mr * stepped out with a * of papers under his arm closer pressed the * face against the glass * grew the grasp of the * fingers on the * she had no strength to meet him he closed the door hung up his hat and looked into the * no fire in the * no light in the * cold and dark save the reflection on that front window electra i am here no letter she stood * a moment but the * walls opposite the trees the * *

she heard a voice which even amid the * of * would have been * to her and breaking from him she sprang to the * and met her cousin oh russell i thought you had forgotten me what put such a * thought into your head my last letter must have prepared you to expect me what letter i have had none for three weeks one in which i mentioned mr * foreign appointment and the position of secretary which he *

you from the necessity of * in the * mr * will prove a noble and generous friend and believe me my cousin the thought of leaving you so long is the only thing which will * the pleasure of my * * the words were kind enough but the tone was * and the countenance showed her that their approaching separation * him little she thought of the * nights and wretched days she had passed waiting for a letter from that tall reserved cold cousin and her features * in a * smile at the * of her * love raising his eyes * he caught the smile wondered what there was to call it forth in the plans which he had just laid before her and meeting his glance of surprise she said * are you not going to see irene before you * his cheek flushed as he rose * himself and answered a strange question truly from one who knows me as well as you do call to see a girl whose father sent her from home * to prevent her from * with my family through what sort of * do you suppose that i have passed that every * of * has been crushed out of me her fathers * and * can never * her noble and affectionate * of aunt * in the hour of her need and when i am able to * her every cent we * her then and not till then i wish to see her things shall change * * is * * and the day will come when mr huntingdon may not think it * for his daughter to * my acquaintance on the street a brief silence ensued russell drew on his * and finally said * dr * told me she had suffered very much from a fall yes for a long time she was confined to her room has she recovered entirely entirely she * more beautiful day by day perhaps he wished to hear more concerning her but she would not * him and soon after he took up his hat mr * has a spare room russell why cant you stay with us while you are in new york thank you but mr campbell

the * of his * face but kindly * from any * to it he saw that contrary to habit she * a cup of coffee and * her arm as she requested his mother to give her a second he said gently my dear child where

crowd slowly * * * every week and people become accustomed to the spectacle are you ready to go now asked mr * yes ready quite * * she spoke in a tone which had lost its * music and with a * smile that fled over the * face * the features no light no * he tried to * her mind by calling attention to various things of interest but the utter * of her position and the * character of her * soon * him both felt relieved when the carriage stopped before the * and as he led her up the steps he said affectionately i am afraid my * has not * your head no sir but i thank you most * for the kind effort

still kept its hold upon you but i saw too what you saw quite as * in russell * heart there is room for nothing but ambition i knew how you suffered and i believed it was the * of your love but instead i find you day by day before that * of me of everything but the features you * to so * do you wonder that i hate that portrait do you wonder that i am growing desperate if he loved you in return i could bear it better but as it is i am * beyond all * i have spent nearly three years in trying to gain your heart all other * have * before this one * love today i lay it at your feet and ask if i have not * some * oh electra have you no gratitude a scarlet spot burned on his pale cheeks and the * * grey eyes * like stars he stretched out his hand but she drew back a step god forgive me but i have no such love for you a * smile broke over his face and after a moment the * * he passed across his lips was * with * * i know that and i know the reason but once more i ask you to give me your hand electra dearest do not i pray you refuse me this oh child give me your hand and in time you will learn to love me he seized her fingers and stooped his head till the * brown * mingled with her * * mr * to marry without love would be a * sin i dare not we would hate each other life would be a * to both and death a welcome * could you endure a wife who accepted your hand from gratitude and pity oh such a * would be horrible beyond all degree i * at the thought but you would learn to love me but you cannot take * place none can come between him and my heart electra grey you are * in your * love * if so made such by your * * were you more * i had never * your * * of * and this is my * for all the tenderness i have * on you when i stooped to beg your hand to be repulsed with * and * to spend three years in faithful effort to win your heart and * * * * back he sank into his * and closed his eyes a moment then continued i would not have troubled you long electra it was because i knew that my life must be short at best that i urged you to * the brief period with the light of your love i would not have bound you always to me and when i asked your hand a few minutes since i knew that death would soon * the * and set you free let this * to * my * * i have but one request to make of you now and weak as it may seem i beg of you not to deny me you are preparing to leave my house this i know i see it in your face and the thought is * to me electra remain under my roof while i live let me see you every day here in my house if not as my wife stay as my friend my * my child i little thought i could ever * to ask this of * but the dread of separation * me down oh child i will not claim you long she stood up before him with the portrait in her arms resolved then and there to leave him for ever but the * * of his face the scarlet * * over his lips and * the * with which he * to * it told her that the request was preferred on no * * in * review his kindness * and * affection passed before her and the mingled * of * and * whispered pay your * of gratitude by * your heart if you can make him happy you * it to him softly she took his hand and said in a low * tone mr * i was passionate and * and said some * things which i would * recall and for which i beg your pardon i thank you for the honour you would have * on me and for the * love you offered me unless it were in my power to return that love it would be * to give you my hand but since you desire it so earnestly i will promise to stay by your side to do what i can to make you happy to prove by my devotion that i am not * to all your kindness that i am very grateful for the affection you have given me i come and offer you this as a poor return for all that i * you it is the most my conscience will permit me to tender my friend my master will you accept it and forgive the pain and sorrow i have caused you he felt her tears falling on his fingers and for a moment neither spoke then he drew the hands to his lips and kissed them tenderly thank you electra i know it is a sacrifice on your part but i am * enough to accept it heaven bless you my * in future we will not * to this day of * it be forgotten let the dead past * its dead i will have no * * and now sir you must not allow this slight * to * you in a few days you will be stronger quite able to examine and find fault

met his sad gaze this is * weather for you mr * yes this winter * a dreary * resting her * in her hands she raised her eyes and said why do you not follow the * advice a winter south might * you he drew near and leaning his folded arms on the top of the * looked down into her face there is only one condition upon which i could consent to go that is in your hands will you accompany me she

of the house irene stood not far off talking to the governor of the state who * to be on a brief visit to w and quite near her judge * and her father were in earnest conversation * at the sudden * her eyes followed him as he bowed to the member of the * group and as she heard the deep rich voice above the * of small talk she waited to see if he would notice her soon governor g gave her his arm for a * and she found herself ere long very near * who was approaching with russell he was saying something at which she laughed * just then his eye fell on irene there was no * of * on the part of either but the governor in passing put out his hand to shake * and asked for mr campbell again and again they met during the * hour but no * was exchanged then he disappeared as irene leaned against the * in

and sat down to a mass of papers the apartment was cold the fire had long since died out the * looked * and desolate the * tones of the * on the * recalled him finally from his work he took off his watch and wound it up it wanted but three hours to dawn but he * it not the sight of the * old watch brought * back the * days of sorrow and he sat thinking of that morning of shame when irene came close to him * her soft little hand in his and from some * dark * chamber of memory leaped sweet * childish * oh russell if i could only help you since his return from europe he had accustomed himself to think of her as * wife but he found it daily more difficult to realize that she could * give her hand to her * * cousin and now the * in her manner toward him * and * him did she * the truth and

weeks all w was * with interest in the * election * columns * with * articles and huntingdon and aubrey * * each other with the usual * of such occasions mr * influence was * but the huntingdon * were

as he took his seat amid an * which would have been * even in the days of the * of * russell was sitting on the upper step with his head leaning on his hand and his eyes fixed on the mass of * eager faces listening * to the * address * just what he was destined to hear at the mention of his family * he lifted his head rose and advancing a few steps took off his hat and stood * the * in full view of the excited crowd and there the red light * over his features showed a calm stern * man who felt that he had nothing to * for in the past or to dread in future when the * ended when the * ceased and silence fell upon the audience he turned and fixed his deep * eyes full on the face of his * for one moment smiling * then as mr huntingdon * before his * gaze he crossed his arms over his * and

and folded her * closer around her dont you think irene that aubrey * to * yes her dreary tone * him and he offered no further comment little * that her hands were pressed hard against her heart and that her * sorrow was henceforth we must be still more * a * * from this night * us two years rolled on * with the tears of many * with the songs and laughter of a fortunate few the * of southern spring again * w and irene stood on the lawn * the * of the * world that surrounded her in this womans sad but * calm countenance a * life found silent history she felt that her life was passing rapidly * and * she knew that her years instead of being * with the * * of good deeds were * and * and that the * * hand of * was closing upon her the * of spirits the * of youth had given place to a * of * * * a mental and moral * was * over her the * of the * iron gate attracted her attention and she saw a carriage * the avenue as it reached a point opposite to the spot where she stood it halted the door was thrown open and a gentleman stepped out and approached her the form was not familiar and the * hat partially * the features but he paused before her and said with a * smile dont you know me oh * my brother my great * angel a glad light * in her face and she stretched out her hands with the * of a delighted child time had pressed heavily upon him * were conspicuous about the * of his eyes and mouth and the black hair had become a * grey holding her hands he drew her nearer to him * her features and a look of keen sorrow crossed his own as he said almost * i feared as much i feared as much the shadow has spread you kept * faith with me sir you promised to write and failed i sent you one letter but it was never answered through no fault of mine irene i never received it believe me true i expected to write to you frequently when i parted with you but subsequently determined that it would be best not to do so * my silence however to every other cause than want of * god only knows how i have wanted how i have needed you to guide and * me she raised the two hands that still held hers and bowed her forehead upon them for some moments silence * then standing before him irene said with touching * my friend i am so desolate so lonely i am * down the * of life * hopeless useless what shall i do with my future i believe i am slowly * i neither suffer nor enjoy as formerly my feelings are * i am growing * * to everything i am fast losing sympathy for the * of others * up in * * of the noble * of promise once more i ask you what shall i do with my life give it to god ah there is neither grace nor * in necessity he will not accept the * thing thrown at his feet as a * * once it was my choice but the pure * faith of my childhood shook hands with me when you left me in new york for a short while he * with himself * to * the * * which suddenly * him and his face grew * as hers as he walked hastily across the * grass and came back to her her countenance was lifted toward the * hill her thoughts evidently far away when he paused before her and said * irene my beloved give yourself to me go with me into gods * let us work together and * our lives to his service the * eyes gazed into his full of wonder and the rich * * fled from her lips as she * his words in * astonishment and * her * head answered slowly * i am not worthy i want your * not your pity pity you mistake me if you have been ignorant so long know now that i have loved you from the evening you first sat in my study looking over my foreign * you were then a child but i was a man and i knew all that you had so suddenly become to me because of this great * in years and because i dared not hope that one so tenderly * could ever brave the * of my * life i determined to * new york earlier than i had anticipated and to * a * memory in the * * of the far west i ought to have known the * of my * i have proved it since your face followed me your eyes met mine at every turn your glittering hair swept on every * that touched my cheek irene you are young and * beautiful and i am a * man much much older than yourself but if you live a thousand years you will never find such affection as i offer you now there is nothing on earth which would make me so happy as the possession of your love you are the only woman i have ever seen whom i even wish to call my * only woman who i felt could * new * to life and make my quiet * * by her presence irene will you share my future can you give me what i ask the * was * future he held out * indeed the strong holy * love the noble heart and head to guide her the firm tender hand to support her the constant * and delightful * this passed * through her mind but * all in its grasp came the memory of one whom she rarely met but who held * * over her proud heart drawing close to the minister she laid her hands on his shoulder and looking * up into his fine face said in her * sweet clear voice the knowledge of your * * love makes me proud beyond degree but i would not * you by the miserable and only return i could make * affection of a devoted sister that i do not love you as you wish is my great misfortune for i appreciate most fully the noble privilege you have * me i trust that the pain i may give you now will soon pass away and that in time you will forget one who is utterly * of the honour you have * on her today oh * do not i beg of you let one thought of me ever * your noble generous heart a * crept over her still face and she dropped her pale forehead she felt two tears fall upon her hair and in silence he bent down and kissed her softly tenderly as one * a sleeping * oh * do not let it * you dear friend he smiled sadly as if not daring to trust himself in words then after a moment * his hands upon her head in the * of a * love he gently and * blessed her when his fingers were removed she raised her eyes but he had gone she saw only the retreating form through the green * of the grand old avenue says * the * of men is now so far exhausted in * for places that none is left for * the duties of them and the history of our government * a melancholy * the regular * storm had swept over the nation * had been held and * * fought for to be * away plank by plank when they no longer served as * by which to * to office * was * but destined to * during his administration the truth of * words he was regarded as

in town and had almost accomplished her * when the * and * of * drew her to the window that looked out on the lawn her father had gone to the plantation early that morning and she had scarcely time to

door saw him * into the * * buggy * * and sprang off in his usual style and with a * of the * and wave of his hat * was * started seven hours later irene sat alone at the library table absorbed in writing an article on * * theory for the * journal to which she occasionally * over the * of * gradually her thoughts * from the * task to other * of scarcely less interest the week previous she had accompanied * to an * * given by the * * and had been * to find russell seated on the * in front of her he so rarely showed himself on such occasions that his appearance * some comment they had met frequently since the evening at mr * but he * * * her and on this particular night though he came during an * to speak to grace * who sat on the same * of * with irene he never once directed his eyes toward the latter this * * she felt assured was not the result of the bitter * existing between her father and himself and though it * her for a while she began finally to * the true nature of his feelings and with womans rarely * * laid her finger on the real * which * him the report of his engagement to grace had reached her some days before and now it * to her mind like a * * she did not believe for an instant that he was attached to the pretty * girl whom * gave him but she was well aware that he was * of high social position and feared that he might possibly from * * reasons seek an * with judge * only daughter knowing that the family was one of the * and most * in the state life had seemed dreary enough before but with this * added it appeared * and she was conscious of a degree of * never * of or realized * not even a sigh escaped her she was one of a few women who permit no * * of suffering but * it * in their own proud hearts the painful * might perhaps have * till the * dawn looked in with * eyes at the window but * who was sleeping on the * at her feet started up and * she raised her head and listened but only the * of the * was * and the * of the wind through the * * down * hush sir she * his head * and he sank back a few * in quiet then sprang up with a loud * this time she heard an * sound of steps in the hall and thought * * my light through the window and is coming to * me upstairs something * near the * a hand struck the * as if in * for it the door opened softly and * in his heavy * holding his hat in one hand russell aubrey stood in the room neither spoke but he looked at her with such mournful * such eager yet * * that she read some terrible disaster in his eyes the years of * all that had passed since their childhood was forgotten * * fell away at the sight of him standing there for the first time in her home she crossed the room with a quick * step and put out her hands toward * horrible * * the beautiful lips which asked * what is it russell what is it he took the cold little hands * in his and * to draw her back to the * but she repeated what has happened is it father or * your father is well i believe i passed him on the road yesterday sit down miss huntingdon you look pale and faint her fingers closed * over his he saw an * * * on her face and in an * calm low tone she asked is * dead oh my god why dont you speak russell he did not suffer much his death was too sudden her face had such a * look that he would have passed his arm around her but could not * his hand she seemed to * to it as if for strength wont you let me carry you to your room or call a servant you are not able to stand she neither * nor heard him was it that horse or how was it one of the bridges had been swept away by the * and in trying to cross he * the ford the horse must have been frightened and * the buggy was * in the creek and your cousin * by the fall * instantly life was just * when i reached him something like a * escaped her as she listened was anything done we tried every means of * but they were entirely * she * her * of his fingers and moved toward the door where are you going miss huntingdon indeed you must sit down russell you have brought him home where is he without waiting for an answer she walked down the hall and paused suddenly at the sight of the still form resting on a grey * with a * at its head and an * man a stranger sitting near keeping watch russell came to her side and drawing his arm around her made her * upon him he felt the long long * * which shook the * * figure then she slipped down beside the rigid * and * back from the fair brow the * * * hair * my cousin my * * away in an hour from the life you loved so well ah the * of our house has fallen upon you it is but the beginning of the end only two of us are left and we too shall soon be caught up to join you she kissed the * lips which a few hours ago had pressed hers so * and rising walked up and down the long hall russell once more approached her are you entirely alone yes except the servants oh russell how am i to break this to my father he loves that boy better than everything else * better than he ever loved me how shall i tell him that * is * a * has already gone to * him of what has happened and this * task will not be yours * * and i were riding together on our return from t when we reached the ford where the disaster occurred finding that all our efforts to * were useless he turned back and went to your fathers plantation to break the sad intelligence to him his * tender tone touched some * deep in her strange nature and * tears gathered for the first time in her eyes as you have no friend near enough to call upon at present i will if you desire it * the servants remain and do all that is necessary until morning if you please russell i shall thank you very much as her glance fell upon her cousins * face her lip * and she turned away and sat down on one of the * in the * * her face in her hands a little while after the light of a * * in and russell came with a * from the library * and his warm * he wrapped the latter carefully about the * form and would have placed her head on the * pillow but she silently * without looking up and he left her it was a * which she never forgot the fire had died out entirely the * were drawn back to let in the day on the library table the * * of white * showed the * of the cold young * and russell slowly * the floor his arms crossed as was their habit and his powerful form * erect she stood by the table * then folded down the * and exposed the handsome * face she * it long and quietly and with no burst of emotion laid her flowers against his cheek and mouth and scattered the * over his * heart i begged him not to start yesterday and he answered that he would go if the stars fell and judgment day * him sometimes we are * * his star has * day has * have mercy on his soul oh my god the voice was low and even but * sweet and in the solemn morning light her face showed itself grey and * no * of * on the still lips only the blue * standing out between the brow sure * of a deep distress which found no * russell felt a * weight lifted from his heart he saw that she had loved her cousin * more and his face flushed when she looked across the table at him with grateful but * melancholy eyes which had never been closed during that night of horror i must now relieve you russell from your friendly watch few would have * as you have done and for all your generous kindness to poor * i thank you most earnestly as well for my father as myself the day may come perhaps when i shall be able to prove my gratitude and the * of my friendship which has never * since we were children together until that day farewell russell but believe that i * to hear of your * she held out her hand and as he took it in his which trembled * he felt even then that there was no * in the * fingers and that his name * over her lips as * as that of the dead had done just before she * his long * gaze like any other * and he dropped the little * hand and * the room at ten oclock mr huntingdon returned and with his hat drawn over his eyes went straight to the library he kissed the face of the dead * and his * and violent burst of sorrow told his child of his arrival she lifted her rigid face and extended her arms * father father here at least you will forgive me he turned from her * and answered with bitter * i will not but for you he would have been different and this would never have happened father i have asked for love and pardon for the last time she bent down and kissed her cousin and with a hard bitter expression in her countenance went up to her own room * out * and old * who followed * at her * had * her forest * golden * and * * crimson * and scarlet * shook out their * and waved their * * all dashed and * * and * with orange and blood * green and * brown the * atmosphere which had hung all day in purple folds around the distant hills took a golden * as the sun sank rapidly and to * gaze river and * * and valley were * with that * light which never was on sea or land her almost * love of nature had grown with her years but a * * mingled with her * now she looked beyond the material veil of beauty and bowed * before the * * presence since * death nearly a year before she had become a * * herself of her mourning dress to * all social * and during these months a narrow path opened before her feet she became a member of the church which she had attended from * and her hands closed firmly over her * sorrow and want hung out their * among the poor of w and here silently but * she had become not a * angel certainly but a generous * a noble * * * whose strong good sense rendered her advice and * valuable indeed by a system of rigid * she was enabled to set apart a small portion of money which she gave * * its * kind * words she scattered like sunshine over every * and here and there where she * * * or * * of * she * the * with some * volume from her own library which in more than one instance became the * the spring of joy for ever frequently her father threw * in her way * all the while at her * * sometimes she * not to notice the * sometimes * * their * and * right over them on to her work among the * * she found the greatest need of * * of every kind * * in some cases almost * she occasionally found herself * as to the proper plan to * but her * heart like the hidden * * of a watch * the * hands * this evening as she approached the * of low * houses a crowd of children * out as usual to * at her she rode up to a * where a boy of some * years sat * himself with an open book on his knee and a pair of * beside him at sight of her a bright smile broke over his * face and he tried to rise good evening * dont get up how are you today better i thank you * but very * yet the * will pass off gradually i hope i see you have not finished your book yet how do you like it oh i

proved * light and she was soon pronounced * but little * was * ill and for several nights irene sat at his pillow * that every hour would be his last while his * was at its height * was taken * and on the morning when irene felt that her * was not in vain and that the boy would get well his little sister whom she had * quite as * grew rapidly worse and died at noon as is frequently observed in such * this increased in * with every new case it spread with * * through the * * the efforts of the best * in w and finally the day after * death as irene sat trying to comfort the poor mother a * came in * oh miss irene * * is down too he caught the fever from his mother and his father says wont you please come over she went promptly though so * she could scarcely stand and took a seat by the bed where * the poor boy in whom she had taken such an interest you must go home miss huntingdon you are worn out his father can watch him till his mother * stronger said dr * who was fully * with the * * at the next house no i must stay with * perhaps he will know me when he * a hope * to disappointment for he * for four days and nights calling * for the * sad woman who sat at his pillow * over him and * her cold hand on his * brow on the fifth day being free from fever and utterly * he seemed * rapidly but she kept her fingers on his * and without waiting for the * advice * powerful * so passed two hours of painful anxiety then * opened his eyes * and looked at her * do you know me * irene she sank back as if some strong * hand had suddenly been withdrawn from her and * that she looked * mr * hastily brought her a glass of water just then dr * entered and * his patient with evident surprise what have you done to him miss huntingdon since daylight i have been giving him * and * his * was so feeble and * i thought he needed it and was afraid to wait for you right and you saved his life by it i could not get here any earlier and if you had delayed it until i came it would probably have been too late you may call him your patient after this she waited no longer but * to the door and * seeing how faint she was came to meet her and led her to the carriage the ten days of watching had told upon her and when she reached home and * brought her * and * her shoes she fell back on her * in a heavy * sleep mr huntingdon had been expected two days before but failed to * at the time * and having her * fully aroused * * a * for dr * do you see any change * none for the better mr huntingdon dropped his head upon his hand again and dr * resumed his slow walk up and down the * the blue * * had been * back from the western window and the broad band of yellow * in the sky threw a * light over the bed where lay the * * of the grand old hill fever * the * cheeks usually pure as * and touched the parted lips with * scarlet * a brilliant and almost * beauty to the * features her hair partially * from * * in * * and folds across the pillow a mass of golden * and the * eyes * from one object to another as if in anxious search the * had assumed a different * and instead of * * her illness was * by a silent * * while * produced only the effect of * her * a week had passed thus during which time she had recognized no one and though numerous lady friends came to offer assistance all were refused permission to see her mr huntingdon was utterly ignorant of the duties of a nurse and though he * the room like an * shadow dr * and * took entire charge of the patient the former was * in his care sitting beside the pillow through the long winter nights and * a few hours sleep during the day watching her now as he walked to and fro he noticed that her eyes followed him earnestly and he paused at the * and leaned over her irene what do you want does my walking * you no answer wont you shut your eyes my darling and try to sleep the deep brilliant eyes only looked into his with * * he put his fingers on the * and pressed them gently down but she * and turned away her face her hands crept constantly along the * * as if * for something and taking them both he folded them in his and pressed them to his lips while tears which he did not attempt to * fell over them you dont think she is any worse do you asked the father * i dont know anything except that she cant lie this way much longer his * voice * and his stern mouth trembled he laid the hands back went to the window and stood there till the room grew * and the lamp was brought in as * closed the door after her the doctor came to the * and said * i would not be in your place for john * * fortune what do you mean by that i mean that if you have any conscience left you must suffer the * of * for the manner in which you have * that child in all that i have ever done i have looked only to her good to her * happiness i know that she hush * hush you are no more fit to be a father than i am to be a * you have * and * her poor innocent soul nearly out of her ever since she was big enough to * why the * could not you let the child have a little peace there are * * to one that she has come to her rest at last you will feel * when you see her in her * his hard face worked * and tears * down the * cheek and * themselves in his grey * mr huntingdon was much * but an * * crossed his brow as he answered hastily i am the best judge of my family matters you are * and severe of course i love my child better than * else heaven preserve her from such love as you have * on her she is very dear to me i understand her character you either cannot or will not she is the only thing in this world that i do really love my pet my * darling he * his face and * a * and for some moments neither spoke after a while the doctor * up his coat and took his hat i am going down to my office to get a different * i will be back soon contrary to his * habit the doctor had taken * of his * until he was completely * and he went home more than usually * and * as he entered his office russell advanced to meet him from the window whence for nearly an hour he had been watching for his arrival good evening doctor what do you want how is miss huntingdon what is miss huntingdon to you she was one of my mothers best friends though only a little girl at the time and you love her for your mothers sake i suppose truly * how is she tonight * are so * that i came to you to find out the truth she is going to die i am

those people yes * take the * i wish the river would * it up if i could only see her exclaimed russell and an expression of such intense agony settled on his features usually so * that his companion was startled and * the doctor regarded him a moment with * and * mingled in his own face then light broke upon him and rising he laid his hand heavily on * shoulder where are you going aubrey back to my office is there any message which you would like for me to * to her if she should recover consciousness you may trust me young man thank you i have no message to send i merely called to ask after her i trust she will yet recover good night he walked on rapidly till he reached the door of his office the * was burning * over his desk and red * and * * him in but * blue eyes calm as * looked up at him and without * he turned and went through the cold and darkness to the cemetery to his mothers * she had been his comfort in * * and habit was strong he went to her grave for it still when russell left him dr * carefully * out the * and rode back to the hill he could * no change unless it were a * of the * on cheeks and lips and an increased * of the fingers which * so * about the *

when he listened to her * and knew that at last she slept his grey head sank on his * and he * * thank god patient as a woman he kept his place at her side * to move lest he should * her the dreary hours of night wore away morning came * bright and still she slept the * had * leaving her * as death and the little hands were now at rest she looked like the figures which all have seen on * and * and often the doctor felt the slow * that seemed weary of its mission he kept the room quiet and * his faithful watch * to leave her for a moment twelve oclock rolled round and it appeared indeed as if * * would prove true the * was so * at three oclock the doctor * the * and * threw his head back against the velvet * of the chair and shut his * eyes before five minutes had * he heard a faint sweet voice say * * to his feet he saw her put out her hand to * the head of her * who could not be kept out of the room and * so * when they * him that they were forced to set him free now he stood with his * on the pillow and his face close to hers * with delight tears of joy almost * the doctor as he pushed * aside and said eagerly irene one dog is as good as another you know * do you know me

in proper * of what is due to my own * the feelings which i have crushed back so long now demand * russell i have determined to break the * of many years * roll away the stone from the * tell you all i feel that you and i must understand each other before we part for all time and therefore i sent for you she paused * her head unable to meet his * steady black eyes * upon hers and drawing his tall * figure to its * height he asked * you sent for me through * * * at the close to be * and in * of * tell me that you pity me pity you no russell i do not pity you it is well i neither * nor desire it

* pale face which no man woman or child ever looked at without emotion before we part probably for ever i should like to know why you sent for me do you remember that one year ago tonight we sat on the steps of the * and you told me of the feeling you had * for me from your * it was a meeting too * with pain and * to be soon forgotten i believe you thought me cold * and * then there was no room to doubt it your * * carried its own * because i knew that such was the * opinion you had entertained for twelve months i sought this opportunity to relieve myself of an * * if peace had been * and you had always remained quietly here i should never have * * the same * reasons the same stern necessity which kept me silent on the night to which i * would have * my lips through life but all things are changed you are going into the very * of death with what result no human * can * and now after long suffering i feel that i have * and may claim the right to speak to you of that which i have always expected to * with me in my grave again her crowned head bowed itself past bitterness and wounded pride were instantly forgotten hope * in his dark stern face a beauty that rarely * there and throwing down his hat he stepped forward and took her folded hands in his strong grasp irene do you intend me to * you willing that i shall believe that after all i have an interest in your * i am more to you than you ever before * to let me know if it indeed be so oh give me the * assurance her lips moved he stooped his * head to catch the low * words you said that night i could forgive your father all all if i knew that he had not so successfully * closed your heart against me forgive him russell you never can know all that you have been to me from my childhood only god who * my heart knows what suffering our long * has cost me an instant he * his strong frame * and then he caught her * in his arms resting her head upon his bosom leaning his * hot cheek on hers cold and * as * at last i realize the one dream of my life i hold you to my heart * all my own who shall dare * the right your lips have given me * is * now none shall come between me and my own o irene my beautiful darling not all my * hopes not all the future * not time nor * could * the proud * joy of this assurance instead of * your affection for me you * against it with all the energy of your character i have seen for some time that you were * to crush it * forget me entirely i do not deny it and certainly you ought not to * me you kept me at a distance with your * yet graceful * * i had nothing to * to suffer i * set to work to * you utterly from my thoughts and i tell you * i * to love another who was brilliant and * and * * but her * * * * was too much like my own to suit me i tried faithfully

became the * of peace rest and because you gave me no friendly word or glance * your * face against me i grew * toward you did you believe that i would marry salome no i had faith that * your * efforts your heart would be true to me why did you * so much pain on us both when a word would have explained all when the assurance you have given me today would have * the past years of trial because i knew it would not have that effect a belief of my * * you against * you to * but a knowledge of the truth would have increased your * of feeling toward him whom you regarded as the chief * and this at all * i was resolved to avoid because i realized so fully the necessity of * i should never have * you with my own feelings had i not known that a long and perhaps final separation now * before us in the painful course which duty * on me i have * to * your * happiness rather than my own irene how can you * yourself that it is your duty to obey an * and * * which * the happiness of two to the * * of one russell do not * me it is useless spare me the pain of repeated * and be satisfied with what i have given you believe that my heart is and ever will be yours entirely though my hand you can never claim i know what i * my father and i will pay to the last * and i know as well what i * myself and therefore i shall live true to my first and only love and die irene huntingdon more than this you have no right to * no right to grant be patient russell be generous do you intend to send me from you to meet me henceforth as a stranger circumstances which i cannot control make it necessary at least you will let me hear from you sometimes you will give me the privilege of writing to you impossible russell do not ask that of me oh irene you are cruel why * that melancholy

that the main column was * against * little band on the extreme left hour after hour passed and the thunder * on the warrenton road then the general learned with * * that his order for an advance on * had * that a brilliant plan had been * and that new * and * must now be * to the regiment to which major huntingdon was attached was ordered to the support of the left wing and reached the distant

to * at * two oclock the awful contest was at its height the * of * the * * of * * the * * of artillery the * * of shot the * of shell dense * of smoke * the * and clouds of dust * up on all sides * * horror to a scene which to cold * * might have seemed * as the * superior numbers of the federals forced our * * to give back slowly an order came from general beauregard for the right of his line

pressed in and they returned * the old ground not a moment was to be lost general beauregard ordered forward his * for a second effort and with magnificent effect led the charge in person then russell aubrey first came * upon the field at the word of command he dashed forward with his splendid regiment and high above all * his powerful form with the long black * of his hat * upon the wind as he led

that the retreat was a complete * he resigned the command to * * and rode back to the battlefield * his way to avoid * the dead russell saw major huntingdon at a little distance trying to * himself toward a * tree the memory of his * crowded upon the memory of all that he had * and lost through that mans * sorrow that might have been * from his blind * his * spirit * at the thought of * him aid but as he paused and * against his better nature * holy face as he saw it last lifted in prayer for him rose * above all that mass of death and horrors the * was * father she was * of miles away russell set his lips firmly and riding up to the * figure dismounted exhausted by his efforts major huntingdon had fallen back in the dust and an expression of * agony * his features as russell stooped over him and asked in a voice meant to be gentle can i do anything for you could you sit up if i placed you on my horse the wounded man * as he recognized the voice and face and turned his head partially away * what brought you here there has never been any love between us major huntingdon but we are fighting in the same cause for the first time in our lives you are * wounded and as a * i should be glad to relieve your * if possible once more for * sake i ask can you ride my horse to the rear if i assist you to mount no but for gods sake give me some water russell * raised the head and * his * put it to his lips * his own wounded arm with some difficulty half of the contents was eagerly * and the remainder russell poured slowly on the * * wound in his side the proud man * him steadily till the last cool drop was exhausted and said * you * me no kindness aubrey i hate you and you know it but you have * * of fire on my head you are more generous than i thought you thank you aubrey lay me under that tree yonder and let me die i will try to find a surgeon who * to your regiment somebody whom i never saw till last week i wont have him * about me leave me in peace do you know anything of your servant i saw him as i came on the field poor william he followed me so closely that he was shot through the head he is lying three hundred yards to the left yonder poor fellow he was faithful to the last a * * the * * eye as he * rather than spoke these words then i will find dr * at once and send him to you it was no easy matter on that crowded * * and the afternoon was * spent before russell faint and weary * dr * * * his * in a group of wounded he rode up and having * a drink of water and * his * approached the surgeon doctor where is your horse i want you * * bring him up what is the matter aubrey you are hurt nothing serious i think but major huntingdon is * * i am afraid see what you can do for him you must be mistaken i have asked * for * and they told me he was in hot pursuit and * i hope to heaven you are mistaken impossible i tell you i lifted him out of a * of his own blood come i will show you the way at a hard gallop they crossed the * woods and without difficulty russell found the spot where the * form lay still he had * with his face turned up to the sky and the * of death had settled on his * marked handsome features god pity irene said the doctor as he bent down and * the * wound * to press the red lips together the pain caused from * him * the brave spirit to consciousness and opening his eyes he looked around * well * it is all over with me old fellow i hope not * cant you turn a little and let me feel for the ball it is of no use i am torn all to pieces take me out of this * on the fresh grass somewhere i must first * the ball aubrey can you help me * him a little * some * he soon succeeded in taking out the ball and with * assistance passed a * round the body there is no chance for me * i know that i have few minutes

with his hands to * the tears that he could not * for some moments silence * then dr * said suddenly come in and let me see your arm your * is full of blood an examination discovered a painful * * ball having glanced from the shoulder and passed out through the upper part of the arm in * the coat to dress the wound the doctor exclaimed here is a * in the breast which must have just * your heart was it a spent ball a peculiar smile * * * teeth an instant but he merely took the coat laid it over his * arm and answered dont trouble yourself about spent * your * i must look after my wounded as

preparation i can for your comfort nothing occurred to * the plan * and electra were cordially received and at * * and the * arrived * the * was lying some distance from the * all * down and apparently * no movement with darkness came a * * wind and clouds * out even dim * at ten oclock all things being in * the captain went on * very soon after the * * of the city then the * walls of * were left behind and the * took her way silently and * * about two oclock being unable to sleep from the * of the vessel electra knowing that * was still on * crept up the steps in the darkness for the * had been * the captain was passing but paused saying in a * is that you miss grey come this way and i will show you something he * her hand led her to the bow where * was sitting on a * of * and * * added in the same * tone look right * see a light the * are upon us look well and you will see a dark * moving mass that is the steamer of which i told you they have found out at last that there is going to be all * of a * and as they cant ride it like my * * little * they are putting back with all possible speed twenty minutes ago they were bearing down on me now you see that they will pass to our left what a pity they dont know their * do you think that they will not see you certainly with * down and * out there is nothing to be seen on such a night as this there dont you hear her * no i hear nothing but the roar of the wind and water ah that is because your ears are not * like mine great * how she * already now be silent on came the steamer which * * eyes almost * by * could * * and her heart beat like a * * as it drew nearer and nearer once she heard a low * laugh of satisfaction escape the captain then with * * the * of a bell was borne from the * * four * oclock how * they will be tomorrow when they find out they passed me without * their * whispered the captain gradually the vessel * the dark mass grew * the light * and was soon lost to view and the sound of the * * was * in the roar of the waves before he went back on * the captain made a comfortable place for her on the sofa in the little * the storm increased until it * a perfect * and the * rolled and * now and then * in every * it was utterly impossible to sleep and * who was suffering from a * passed a miserable night in the white * dawn the captain looked in again and electra thought that no * of sunshine could be more radiant or cheering than his * noble face about noon the fury of the * * the sun looked out through * in the * clouds and toward night fields of quiet blue were once more visible by next morning the weather had * up with a * * wind but the sea still rolled heavily and * unable to bear the motion kept below * to trust himself on his feet electra * to while away the * time by reading aloud to him but many a * look was cast toward the * and finally she left him with a few books and ran up to the open air on the afternoon of the third day after leaving * the captain said well miss grey i shall place you on confederate soil tomorrow god willing then you are going to * yes i shall try hard to get in there early in the morning you will know your fate before many hours do you regard this trial as particularly * of course the * * grow more * and * every day and some danger * * every trial * ought to be pretty well guarded by this time the wind was * and the * * its way * through the autumn night the captain did not close his eyes and just about daylight electra and * aroused by a sudden running to and fro rose and * made their appearance on * what is the matter * matter why look ahead my dear fellow and see where we are yonder is * island * and a little to the right is fort * but the * to the left is hardly six miles off and it will be a * race if i get in there was but a * light * the east where two or three stars burned with * * and beauty and in the grey * and * of * which * over the * waves electra could * nothing the air was * and she said with a slight * i cant see any * there is of course no light there these * but you see that tall white * dont you there look through my glass that low dark object yonder is the * of the fort you will see it more distinctly after a little now look right where my finger points that is the * look up * have * our flag and pretty soon it will be a * for those * * mitchell * they see us there is some movement among them they are getting ready to cut us off this side of the * * we shall see he had crowded on all * and the little vessel dashed through the light * as if conscious of her danger and resolved to * herself * day broke fully sea and sky took the rich orange * which only autumn * give and in this glow a federal * and * slipped from their * and bore down * on the graceful * * but for the * which * me about three oclock i should have run by * and they would never have known it till i was safe in navy * we will beat them though as it is by about twenty minutes an hour ago i was afraid i should have to * her are you getting frightened miss grey oh no i would not have * this for any consideration how rapidly the federal * move they are * on us her * hair * with * * around her forehead she had wrapped a scarlet * shawl about her shoulders and stood with her red lips apart and trembling watched the * race look at the * there was a * at her bow a * of white smoke rolled up then a heavy roar and a * * round shot fell about a hundred yards to the right of the vessel a * of * * the air from the * of the * were * * off her shawl electra shook its bright folds to the * * while her hot cheeks * them in * of * another and another shot was fired in quick * and so * had they become that the last * through the * * one of the small * * they are getting * said the captain looking up * when the * of his * ceased for a moment and with a * * in his fine eyes he added better go below miss grey they might * one of your * next time the * see you i dare say and your red flag * their yankee pride a little do you suppose they can * me certainly through my glass i can see the * at work and of course they see you should not be surprised if they * * at you that is the style of new england * * both * and * were firing now in good earnest and one shell * a few yards from the side of the little vessel * the * and water over the group on * the * of a * from the fort shook the air like thunder and gave to the * the * assurance thus far and no farther the * * on its way a few shot fell behind and soon under the * * of the fort whence the confederate * floated so * on the * *

gave her uncle a written statement of all the facts which she had been able to * concerning the circumstances of his death and thus a * compact was formed to make no reference to the painful subject as she accompanied electra to the room prepared for her on the night of her arrival the latter asked with * emotion irene can you tell me anything about russell i am very anxious to hear something of him irene placed the silver lamp on the table and standing in its glow answered quietly he was wounded in the arm at * but * command of his regiment and is doing very well dr * is the * surgeon and in one of his letters to me he mentioned that your cousins wound was not serious i am going to him immediately unfortunately you will not be allowed to do so the wounded were removed to richmond as promptly as possible but your cousin remained at * where ladies are not permitted then i will write to him to meet me in richmond irene made no reply and watching her all the while electra asked when did you see him last how did he look the day before he started to richmond he was very well i believe but looked * and * than usual he is so * however that i think you need * no * concerning his health the * features the low clear firm voice were * and * brow * and * as she thought her father is dead now there is no * remaining she must love him and yet she gives no sign of interest two days later they sat together before one of the * windows electra was engaged in * off and * * while irene slowly * * from a * of old * which filled a basket at her side neither had spoken for some time the * of their * called up gloomy thoughts but finally electra laid down a roll of * and * her slight fingers said irene the women of the south must exercise an important influence in * our national * and because i felt this so fully i hurried home to share the * and * and trials of my * it is not my privilege to enter the army and * a sword or * but i am going to true * * the crowded * to watch faithfully over sick and wounded i * your plan think it your duty and wish that i could start to richmond with you * i believe that in this way we may save valuable lives you should as you have said

confederacy i cannot like many persons feel * of a * * of the war * * * with the bloody * of her best sons but beyond * * but do you still * to a belief in the possibility of republican * of government this is a question which constantly * me my faith in that possibility is * we shall yet teach the world that * is * but in europe where the subject is eagerly * the impression * that in the great * principle of our government will be found the * of its * this war is * to * the right of secession and the * that all just * rest on the consent of the * with such a * it would be worse than * to object to the secession of any state or states now * the confederacy who at a future day may choose to withdraw from the present compact * our independence which europe * as a * conclusion what assurance have you say they * in * over the * that so soon as the common * of war which for a time * you so closely are over entire * will not * and all your * end in some dozen * * like those of south america and mexico that is an evil which our * must guard against by * provision we are now thank god a thoroughly * people with no * * of * * * interests as states we are completely * in * and

without looking up from the * which she was * into small * irene said electra my friend are you sure that you realize your personal responsibility your * will give you vast influence in forming public taste and i hope much from its * use be careful that you select only the highest * * to offer to your * and women when peace * us to turn our attention to the great work of building up a noble school of southern art we want no feeble * * nor yet the * * which seems to * your mind * from the works you have shown me a slight * crossed the * features of the * as she bit her full lip and asked what

the * and * back fixed her gaze on irene she saw a * cross the quiet mouth and for some * the sad eyes * upon the picture as if * it must have been a magnificent portrait of your cousin years ago but he has changed * since it was painted he looks much older * now irene i value this portrait above everything else save the original and as i may be called to pass through various * i want you to take care of it for me until i come back to w it is a precious trust which i would be willing to leave in no hands but yours you forget that before long i too shall go to virginia then * it away carefully

it is more than a year since i received a line from him he was then still in the west but made no * to the condition of the country irene i hope to see russell soon you were once dear friends have you any message for * word of kind * one of * hands * to her side but she answered * he knows that he always has my best wishes but will expect no message on the following day electra started to richmond taking with her a large supply of hospital stores which the ladies of w had * * had proposed to his * the * of * the hill and becoming an * of his * * * home but she firmly refused to consent to this plan said that she would spend her life in the house of her * and it was finally arranged that her uncle should reserve such of the furniture as he * particularly and offer the * for * with the pretty cottage to which he was * attached during the remainder of autumn irene was constantly engaged in * work for the soldiers in * for several poor families in whom she was much interested and in * visits to the plantation where she found more than enough to occupy her mind and * often wondered at the * system and * she * the grave * with which she * her daily duties and the * * she observed with regard to her past life did you ring * * yes has irene come home not yet sir bring some more wood * to the * of * the * had been removed and * * * * john * them with oak wood swept the * and retired

goes into another battle his offer is * and i shall accept it well i am glad she will own * i have often heard her speak of those old * trees in the front yard she has always * the place at this * the * * them to the diningroom and she allowed her uncle no opportunity of * the conversation when the * was * and they had returned to the library irene drew her table and basket near the lamp and resumed her * the * * and asked * cant you buy as many of those * things as you want without * night and day in the first place i do not * * is * * very easy and i like it in the second place i cannot

intended to go to richmond but various circumstances * to keep me at home i felt that i had duties here which must first be * now the time has come when i can accomplish my * plan dr * has taken charge of the hospital in richmond which was established with the money we sent from w for the relief of our regiments mrs campbell is about to be * as * and i have today decided to join them in his letter received this afternoon he orders me not to come but i know that he will give me a ward when he * me at his * i am aware that you have always opposed this * but i hope sir that you will * your * and go on with me next week it is a strange and * * which i must say i do not * of there are * of * to be * who have more experience and are every way far more * for such positions uncle the men in our armies are not * to fight our battles and the least the women of the land can do is to nurse them when sick or wounded she laid her hand gently on his * hair and added * do not * me uncle * i want your * in all that i do there are only two of us left go with me as my * i could not be happy if you were not with me his eyes filled instantly and drawing her close to him he exclaimed * my dear irene there is nothing i would not do to make you happy happy i fear you never will be ah dont smile and * me i know the difference between happiness and resignation patience * * never yet stole the * of joy i will go with you to virginia or * else that you wish thank you uncle * i will try to make you forget the * of home and give you no reason to regret that you * your wishes and judgment to mine i must not keep you up any later the army of the potomac had fallen back to * when irene reached richmond and the preparations which were being made for the reception of the wounded gave melancholy * of * battles dr * had been * with the * of several * but gave special attention to one established with the * * by the citizens of w and * irene * on the day of her arrival in reply to her * she was directed to a small room and found the physician seated at a table * a * of papers he saw only a form * the * and without looking up called out * well what is it what do you want a word of welcome he sprang to his feet instantly holding out both hands dear child queen god bless you how are you pale as a cloud and thin as a shadow sit down here by me where is * he was much * and i left him at the hotel you have been ill a long time irene and have kept it from me that was not right you should have been honest in your letters a pretty figure you will cut * sick * work in my sight indeed if you say work to me again i will * you into a * * and keep you there till the war is over turn your face to the light i am well enough in body it is my mind only that is ill at ease my heart only that is *

hands to his * mouth and seemed to * for a moment doctor how is electra very * is as well as such an * * * character ought to be at first she * me and that is an * i find it hard to forgive but finally i found the * she is * and * faithful as a nurse does all her duty and more which is saying a good * i am a hard * * you afraid that i will work you more * than a yankee * or a * * see here queen what do you suppose brought electra to richmond a desire to render some service to the sick and suffering and also to be * near her cousin * only the last should be first and the first last russell is a * * dog as he expected she glanced up at him but * from comment yes * is a * * here is his cousin entirely devoted to him loving him above everything else in this world and yet he has not even paid her a visit except in passing through to * with his command he might be a happy man if he would but open his eyes and see what is as plain as the nose on my * you must admit * no * she is a * woman and would suit him * better than my * salome a startled * expression came into * large eyes and gradually a look of keen pain settled on her features * did that idea never * to you before never sir and you must be mistaken why child the fact is * you women * to be so * too in such * am * at your * she * aubrey it is scarcely strange that she should she has no other relatives near her and it is natural that she should love her cousin i tell you i know what i say she will never love * else as she loves aubrey besides what is it to you whether he * her or not i feel attached to her and want to see her happy as * wife no sir the marriage of cousins was always * to me she did not * from his glittering grey eye and her * look * is she here can i see her she is not in this building but i will * her of your arrival i have become much interested in her she is a brilliant * creature and has a soul which cannot safely be * of all the * * where are you going back to uncle * will you put me in the same hospital with electra and mrs campbell i will put you in a * i promise you that electra was * surprised at the unusual * with which irene received her some hours later but little * why the lips * in their pressure of hers or understood the * tenderness of the eyes which * so * on her face the * wall of reserve had suddenly * as if in the breath of an august noon and * silently down among things long past * name was * mentioned more than once and electra fell asleep that night * * that the torn and * pages of her heart had been thoroughly * by the woman from whom she was most anxious to * the truth having engaged a * of rooms near the hospital a few days * for * arrangements and irene was * in a ward of the building to which she had requested dr * to * her thus by different by * * * two * women * upon the broad * of duty and * hands pressed forward to the * appointed * * only those who have faithfully * in a hospital can fully appreciate the * nature of the * thus * realize the * anxiety the * * the * * of brain and * the * * * and * of heart over * which no human skill can * and the silent * tears which are shed over * of men whose families * in far distant homes praying gods mercy on dear ones lying at that moment * and cold on hospital * with strangers hands about the loved * day by day week after week those * * walked the painful round from patient to patient * food and * to * bodies and words of hope and * to souls who * not from the * and roar and * of battle but * and * before the daring * which * memory called from the peaceful happy past it was not wonderful that the * * regarded them with * which * on * or that often when the pale thin faces lighted with a smile of joy at their approach irene and electra felt that they had a * * it was a long low rather narrow room * with * of * which stretched on either side to the door now left open to admit free * of air a * * * on the * two soldiers who had been permitted to visit their sick comrades * heavily one with head * on his * the other with chair * against the * and * face thrown back the * flame of the * * * along the line of * youthful almost childish others bearing the * of * years some * with fever others * and * with the * of * here a forehead bent and * as in fancy the * lived over the * and * of battle and there a * smile * the stern * mouth as the * heard again the welcome bay of * on the * at home and saw once more the loved * of wife and children * * from the * * to meet his * arms a few * * and * * * * * up and down the room sometimes * * who once or twice lifted his head to listen and then sank back to * before a small pine table where stood numerous * irene drew her chair and leaning forward opened her * and rested her head on her hand a wounded boy started up * one arm as if in the act of cheering and then fell back * with pain which the violent effort cost him irene stooped over him and softly * his * removed the hot bloody * from his * shoulder and * them with fresh folds of * cold and * she poured out a glass of water and lifted his head but he * and exclaimed i wont have it in a * mother make * bring me a * fresh from the spring i say send * for some she * the * walked out of the room and paused in the passage as she did so a dark form * * into a dim corner and when she * the room with the * of water the figure passed through the * out into the night here is your * * fresh and cold he * the * eagerly and his handsome face wore a touching expression as he smiled and whispered hush * is singing under the old * down by the spring listen * belle we used to sing that in camp but nobody * like * so sweet so sweet he set his teeth hard and * * and taking his fingers in hers she found them * * here i am miss irene go upstairs and ask the doctor to come here the surgeon came promptly i am afraid he is going into * what shall i do for him yes just what i have been trying to guard against i fear nothing will do any good but you might try that * which * like a * on * here is the * how much shall i give a * every * while the * last if he can * it it cant possibly do any * and may ease his suffering poor fellow may the * of a * god seek out his * i would stay here with you miss huntingdon if i could render any service as it is i am more needed upstairs the * were short but so severe that occasionally she required andrews assistance to hold the * on his * and as they grew less * she saw that his strength failed rapidly finally he fell into a troubled sleep with one hand * her arm nearly an hour passed thus and the nurse * softly beside her charge and prayed long and * that the soul of the young * might find its home with god and that his * mourning mother might be * to bear this heavy burden of * as she * with her face * a soft warm * was laid upon her forehead and a low sweet * voice pronounced in * may the lord bless you irene and * answer all your prayers she rose quickly and put out her * hand oh * dear friend thank god i have found you once more he lifted the * and held it near her face * the * features then stooped and kissed her white cheek i felt that i could not be mistaken i heard our soldiers blessing a pale woman in black with large eyes * than summer * and hair that shone like * of a * sun and i knew the silent gentle * * before they told me her name for many years i have prayed that you might become an * of good to your * and tonight i * to find you at last an earnest * where have you been this long time * and how is it that you wear a confederate uniform i am * in a texas regiment and have been with the army from the beginning of these days of blood at first it was a painful step for me my * my * the * * of my * all * my heart with new york my relatives and

nation his eyes * upon her face as she looked gladly at him and over her waving hair his hands passed tenderly as they had done long years before when she was an * in his fathers house you have found your work and learned * in * irene the peaceful look of your childhood has come back to your face with my face pressed against the * i have been watching you for more than an * since colonel aubrey came * i know all the * of the circumstances that * you how painful it is for you to see those men die colonel aubrey he has not been here yes i passed him on the steps we rode up together from camp he came on special business and * at daylight but i shall remain several days and hope to be with you as much as the nature of your * will permit aubrey is from w you know him of course yes i know him he saw a * of regret * over her countenance and added i have many things to say to you and much to learn concerning your past but this is not the time or place for such * of thought and feeling tomorrow we will talk tonight i could not * my * to see you though but for a few moments she drew a chair near young * the wounded boy and * herself continued when independence is obtained and * peace * her * hands in blessing over us let history * and let our people * remember that to the * * and * devotion of the private soldiers of the confederacy not less than to the genius of our generals and the * of our * officers we are * for freedom she laid her head close to the boys mouth to listen to his low * and the minister saw her tears fall on his pillow and * on his * * the * seemed to have

see her early in the morning he left her to keep alone her solemn * and through the remaining hours of that * june night she * not from the narrow * her fingers on the * * * her eyes on his * face about three oclock he * * slightly and looked * at her she gave him some * and found that he * with great difficulty slowly a * rolled away irene could * feel the faint * at * * * and as she put her ear to his lips a long last * sigh escaped * battle of life was ended * relief had come the young * passed to his eternal rest tears dropped on the still face as the nurse cut several * of * hair that * round the * * and took from the * heart the loved picture which had been so often and so tenderly kissed in the * light of * irene covered the noble head the fair handsome features with her * and * * pointed to the * her own ward and entered one beyond the passage it was * but similar in * to the room where she had passed the night a * was * in its * and the cold * white dawn * in at the eastern window upon * of * and * * * there in the centre of the room with her head bowed on the table sat or rather leaned electra * * with her scarlet shawl gathered about her * watch * in one hand and the other holding a volume open at * irene lifted the black * that partially * the flushed neck and whispered electra * up i am going home is it light yet out of doors ah * see i have been asleep exactly fifteen * the last * of * at four oclock how is the boy i am almost afraid to ask dead * lived till daylight oh how sad how * i went to your door twice and looked in but once you were praying and the last time you had your face down on * pillow and as i could do nothing i came back dr * told me he would die and it only made me suffer to look at what i could not relieve i am * my cases are all doing well that new * has * * on mr * yonder who has * just feel his * and pleasant as a childs i have some * to leave with * about giving * before the doctor comes down and then i shall go home are you ready yes i have a singular feeling about my * and an * when i * wonder if i have caught cold electra did you see * last night no where did he come from he is * in a regiment near richmond and said he would see us both this morning was russell here last night russell no why do you ask is he in the city have you seen him she rose quickly laid her hand on * and looked * at her i have not seen him but your cousin * mentioned that colonel aubrey came up with him on some very important * and had but a few hours to remain i will get my shawl and join you in five minutes electra you must stay at home and rest for a day or two you are * and worn out with constant watching it is a mercy that she is * otherwise her * excitement and anxiety would probably prove fatal she is very ill of course but with careful * i think you have little to * above all things irene suffer nobody to * into that room with the * her as quiet as possible i have perfect confidence in * skill he will do all that i could though i would not leave her if i did not feel it my duty to * to the battlefield queen you look weary but it is not strange after all that you have passed through doctor when will you start in twenty minutes has any intelligence been received this morning nothing but * of last nights news hill * * and the enemy have fallen back in the direction of * swamp a general advance will be made all along our lines today and i must be off what is the matter surely you are not getting frightened * * no i have no * about the safety of richmond defeat is not written in lees * but i * in view of the precious human * to be * on yonder hills before mcclellan is driven back no doubt of victory * me but the thought of its awful price she paused and her whole face * as she laid her clasped hands on his arm * is it dear child what * you so doctor promise me that if colonel aubrey is mortally wounded you will send instantly for me i must see him once more her head went down on her hands and she trembled as white * do in an early autumn * * the old man drew one arm around her after all then you do care for * your * reserve and * * i have * as much several times but that * * of yours always * me my child you need not * your head he is worthy of your love he is the only man i know whom i would gladly see you marry irene look * * * know this conscious of your affection for aubrey did he * you to your lonely lot no my father died in * of what would have * and * him beyond measure knowing him as well as you do can you suppose that i would ever have allowed him to * the truth i realized my duty and * it that is the only * i have left it never caused him one * of regret or furnished food for bitter reflection and the * of respect i * to his memory shall be as faithfully * if colonel aubrey lives to enjoy the independence for which he is * he should be spared to become a useful * member of * of the pure and able * whom his country will require when these dark days of * are ended i can be * though separated from him and watching his brilliant career * off but if he must give his life for that which he * * still i ask the privilege of seeing him again of being with him in his last moments this * the brave spirit of my father would not * from me were * allowed between living and dead this none can have the right to deny me i promise that you shall know all as early as possible if you receive no * believe that he is * as yet his regiment has not moved forward but i know not how soon it may heaven preserve you my precious child he pressed a kiss on the * head and left her to * her watch in the * room where electra had been ill with * for nearly three weeks it was thought that she * the * in the crowded hospital and when * ensued irene * * her ward to other *

and out on various * of mercy occasionally anxious * soldiers softly lifted the * of the tent gazed sadly * on the * figure of the beloved commander and turned away silently with tears * down their *

yesterday he lifted his eyes toward heaven and for some moments his lips moved * in prayer gradually a * expression settled on his features and as his eyes closed again he * * * me a little they lifted him and rested his head against her shoulder irene i am here russell my arms are around you she laid her cheek on his and listened to catch the words but none came the lips parted once and a soft * breath swept across them dr * put his hand over the * * greeted him and turning away the old man covered his face with his * russell speak to me once more there was no sound no motion she knew that the soldiers spirit had * to the * of * peace and that not until she joined him there would the loved tones again make music in her heart she * her arms around the still form and * her cheek closer to his now growing cold no burst of grief escaped her to tell of agony and despair * * * * the care * upon her and one afternoon ten days after quiet had again settled around the confederate

let me see the papers my eyes are strong enough now and i want to know exactly what has taken place everywhere during my * it seems to me impossible that general lees army can face mcclellans much longer without bringing on a battle and i am so anxious about russell if he should be hurt of course i must go to him it is very strange that he has not written are you sure no letters came for me there are no letters i am sure but i have a message for you i have seen him once since you were taken sick ah what is it he heard that i was ill and came to see me i suppose when was he here irene bent down and kissed her companion * saying slowly he desired me to kiss you for him electra i have not told you before because i feared the effect upon you in your weak state but there have been desperate battles around richmond during your illness and the federals have been * back to james river was russell wounded * understand it all now where is he oh tell me that i may go to him she
