whether a faithful record of my long and * * at washington in the hands of the enemies of my country will prove as interesting to the public as my friends assure me it is to them i know not it is natural for those who have suffered * to * the importance and interest of their own * yet i should not venture upon * these notes and * merely as a narrative of * * upon myself * it is hoped that the story may * more than a simple feeling of * or * by * somewhat of the * spirit in which the present * against the * of sovereign states was * and somewhat of the true character of that race of people who * on * us by force to live with them in bonds of * and union i had been long a * of washington before the secession of the confederate states and from my * acquaintance with public men and public measures under the old government had peculiar and * means of watching the * * of the * of these leaders of opinion in the federal states which as i had long * would * end in * on a separation much of my information upon this subject had been * from the * of society in the federal capital and would therefore have been * to be made public if the relations of the north and the south had continued as they used to be subjects of political discussion and party contest but the federal leaders have now carried the matter far beyond this point after repeated and * * upon the rights of these states accompanied and * by an * tone of moral * until a union with such * was no longer to be * by any * people they at length * up a furious and * war for two years a * of blood has * between their people and my people the noble state of virginia with which i am most nearly connected has been * by * of * * always * indeed in the field before southern * but always * and * where they found the country * * my own dear native state of maryland has been subject to a still more * and * * in the utter destruction of all her * and in the * of a * and * military * which has reduced the gallant old state to the * condition of * or * and such order * in baltimore as that moral death which * call order in * or in the beautiful city of the sea to me therefore the days of my former * in washington seem to belong almost to another state of being that time when i in common with all our people looked up with pride and * to the * of the stars and * appears to be now with the years before the * i look back to the scenes of that period through a * of blood and horror those men whom i once called friends who have broken bread at my table have since then * up and * on host after host of * * and * them upon the beloved * where my * had their peaceful homes many who were dear to me have been * or * for life fighting in defence of all that makes life of value instead of friends i see in those * of washington only * enemies instead of loving and * the old flag of the stars and * i see in it only the * of murder * * and shame and like every other faithful confederate i * with delight on the many glorious fields where this * * has gone down before the * * of the confederacy in short two years of terrible war * an age of quiet life have passed through the existence of us all leaving a deep and * * between us and those former friends there is a * deep and wide as * and under these circumstances i have felt myself at liberty to be much more * in the narrative of my personal * * in fact nothing which i thought would be either interesting or useful to my confederate * except only when reserve was * by * or by the duty of * * which might compromise the safety of certain federal officers whom i induced without * as will be more fully seen in the following pages to furnish me with information even in my * which information i at once * with pride and pleasure to general beauregard then commanding the confederate forces near washington whatever may be thought of the conduct of these federal officers in * to an * enemy * material to their own government it will * be admitted that after having made this use of them i should not have been * in * them or * a * by which they could be discovered if in * * which passed either with me or in my presence before or after my arrest i may be thought to have exhibited too great bitterness it is hoped that the circumstances under which i found myself may * my excuse it will be seen that i was well aware from an early period of the dark * of the abolition leaders at washington and that while they were holding * the language of * * for the constitution and the law they were already * and preparing all the dreadful scenes of * * and * which have since that time rendered their names * to the whole world it was well known to me what fate they were * for my own native state and what * * they were * to work over all the country both to destroy the confederate states and to crush out the * of the north the chief * of all these horrors too were well aware that i knew their plans and * * and that weak woman as i was i possessed both the means and the spirit to throw serious * in their way * the keen and * * by which my every motion was observed and noted even long before my arrest * also the useless * of * and * to which i was * the * in my place of * and the many * to * me into a * of myself or the confederate cause * the long and * * to break my spirit or * me into * * of * in all of which i trust i may * myself that they * failed satisfied thoroughly of the justice and * of our great cause thinking only of the gallant struggle into which my * had thrown themselves i was enabled not only to possess my own soul and keep my own * but also to * and maintain a * correspondence with virginia and * certain * military movements of enemy in time to have them * by our generals for this i do not desire to take any special credit in the eyes of the public i only performed my duty and have already been * by the thanks of those who best can judge of the services which i * to render and the matter is mentioned here merely as one of the reasons why it has been thought that a narrative furnished by one who enjoyed such * of observation may be found not * it may be that the language which was sometimes * from me in conversation or some of the * now found in my book are more bitterly * and * than in ordinary times and upon ordinary subjects would be becoming in the personal narrative of a woman those who may think so are only * before they judge to * to imagine themselves in my position subject to the * * of a washington prison having to * sometimes the * * of * * sometimes the * * or * of * * to be my friends a little daughter too always before my eyes torn from the peaceful * of home and the * path of * and forced to witness the hard * of * and hear the * * in * * no wonder if my nature grew * and more * and if the * and * that was in my heart sometimes found * by * or pen it was above all things when i thought of my own state of maryland where sleep the * of my * that i burned with * in my prison while the great state of virginia with her strong river * of the potomac was enabled to * * to the * efforts of her enemies it soon became evident that maryland * by great * and * and with her very heart opened up to the * forces of the enemy would be for the present at least * and prevented from * her lot * and * with her sister states i knew also that every * child of maryland * in their souls but one feeling one burning desire to share the * of their section and to * if need be in the glorious struggle and could well imagine how so proud and * a people would suffer and * to see themselves treated as * and * by a race they have always * yet the men were not so deeply to be * they had always at least the * of * themselves across the * * the confederate service and thus either opening a way to the * of their country or at any * meeting her * on many a battlefield and * a * * upon their heads but the women of maryland the * * and * ladies of that fair state they whose * notice in days gone by was so * * by northern men they so * southern in taste and style and association to see their country * by * of the * yankees and their * city * and * under the * * of the * of all human * to know that the * of that little bell at the state department could * the * from her mothers arms to be dragged to the * of a yankee prison the thought was often almost * and it may well be that my profound sympathy with my people has * with a * * of gloom my views of the whole field of action at all events i have * in this * of my * to * a great duty that duty was to * what i myself have seen and known of the history of the time if the * * made of the yankee character in the first year of its * and * * after long * in a condition of * shall add to the feeling of * for such a race of people and * the * gratitude at the happy change which has * us from them and made it still more and more impossible that we can ever * to any kind of political association with them again then my poor narrative will not have been written in vain on * august #* in washington city the * of this once free and happy land the proud * of which was that life liberty and property were * by the law i was made a prisoner in my own house and * to an * which must have been * from the days of the * in france my blood * when i think of it but for the benefit of all who may feel an interest in the subject i will give a * account of an act which should shed * upon the distinguished * of it it is necessary for my purpose to make a brief * of the * of the few months * i might even go back to the * of the * cap and * but will * myself with an event quite as remarkable in the * of the abolition * conflict chief whose shadow now * the chair of washington as the * to the * cap and * may not be generally understood i * it * to furnish information on that head as a means of * the * * by which the abolition leader entered the national capitol he had been * president by a * sectional majority not having received one vote in the states south of * and * line the great * line * north and south * thereby at the very point in our political * which washington in his farewell address had * as a cause for the * of the union during the * sectional contest which resulted in the election of mr lincoln by the abolition party they * * the higher law * and

her on account of the superior * and * which had always given her * in the * of the nation and in the * * in order to carry into effect this * determination to destroy the political importance of the south they had seized upon what they * to be the * point in our domestic institution well knowing that they could * the * aid and sympathy of those who were ignorant save * of that institution and of the * and * manner in which it was conducted in the south having in view no object themselves of * the condition of the * class but to * or drive them out in order that their own * * might secure to

as good as a negro and the negroes i must confess always * to themselves this social * for the * * they could offer each other was you are no better than a poor white yankee the abolition party were not however prepared for the firm and * bearing of the south at the result of an election * sectional and * * of the constitution and they believed according to their own established * that * law would take the matter in hand and * * of the * * or prevent his * excited and * * and plans were made at washington and other places as to the means by which he should reach the capital lincoln had

* of a * cap and * * himself with * * in the * of his sleeping committee of safety at * hotel with * just look at me by * my own * * know me on the morning of the #* of july the government papers at

there was great * * that class of the * * * military men officers and * on horse were seen flying from place to place the tramp of armed men was heard on every side * music filled the air in short a

before on the afternoon of that day i left new york for washington where i arrived at six oclock in the morning of the #* in a most * * even at that early hour friends were awaiting my arrival anxious to * the * of the glorious victory a despatch was also received from manassas by me our president and our general direct me to thank you we * upon you for further information the confederacy * you a * * * * my first * was to throw myself upon my knees and offer up my * thanks to the father of mercy for his signal protection in our hour of * during my journey from new york the * fear of the yankees was * everywhere at philadelphia most of the women got off i was advised to do so by lieutenant wise of * s a * of * * as he said it was believed that the rebels of baltimore would rise in consequence of the * of the federal army i * replied i have no * these rebels are of my faith besides i fear even now i shall not be in time to welcome our president mr davis and the glorious beauregard he * replied that i should probably see those gentlemen there in * i received a * also from mr winter davis who was a * from new york and had been loud * and * against the south during the journey i observed however that he and lieutenant wise got off at philadelphia * * the better part of * a large force was * throughout baltimore and it was even difficult to * ones way to the train on account of the military who crowded the streets and the * thence to washington seemed as one vast camp and on reaching the capitol the very * was * up by its * * who started at the * of their own * after a hurried * and breakfast i went up to the * s senate where i saw the * leaders who but a few days before had * death and * to our race several crowded round me and i could not help saying that if they had not good blood they had certainly good * for they ran * well for days after the * * * in the capitol the streets were filled with * soldiers each telling the * * and each * in * * of * which would throw into the * the * of * de * * de * or * the * even * entered into this * for * * for several assured me * and * that it was their individual * alone which had prevented the entire grand army from * itself * into the potomac and they were really * to the * of a * officer that the * had not been forced upon them a * order had been sent to washington by general * to cut the draw of the long bridge as beauregard and johnson were * * him with fresh troops this bridge * the potomac just opposite washington and was the only means of crossing the river at that point * and * now became the order of the day and everybody * from the responsibility of the forward movement the commanding general scott said i did * do it for i was not ready the political * said we did * do it it was that old * scott whom we will remove president lincoln said i did * do it by * i did * and so in the end the world was about as well informed as to who ordered the advance of the grand army as who killed * * about this time i met mr seward who assured me that there was nothing serious the matter that i might assure my friends upon his authority that all would be over in sixty days i answered him well sir you have enjoyed the * of the * conflict seward had a short time * to his visit to england in a speech delivered by him at * new york as a * for the * as president by the republican party made use of that remarkable expression of the * conflict between the white and black * * even at that early day the policy to which he would * himself in order to * the object of his ambition the executive chair at a later period he * to explain this away and in conversation with me said if heaven would forgive him for * together two * words he would never do it again * things began to quiet down the * of the government press * their * in * the people the * * of the enemy were described these be it known at no time * twelve thousand actually engaged against the more than * force of the * army their * batteries and military * threw into the * the * of * or even the * of * it would be * to * the * of those who fled from * * or to describe the * condition of the returning * who had gone forth to battle flushed with anticipated triumph and crowned in advance with the * of victory alas their * was * enough some were described as being * hat or shoes * this latter class was colonel burnside who on the morning that he * forth for the sacred soil is said to have required two * to carry the flowers * upon him by the women of northern * meanwhile the * sound of the * voice was heard from far and near asking meaning questions of the why and * of the * it was like the * of the distant thunder * the coming storm and well the abolition government knew that if this * was allowed to * strength it would * them from their present * * to the * they * the * had been taught to believe that a * victory awaited them that the all * of the * of * would * them and so possessed were they with the idea of their * mission as * of an * people bowed under the * of a * * that many of their officers particularly the famous new york #* regiment took far more * to prepare white * and * * for the * to be given in their honour at richmond than in * * for their * when * on the subject i said no doubt they would receive a great many * but i did not think that a very * * would be expected the * feeling was now at its height * by defeat they sought a safe means of * their * * the streets were filled with armed and * * women were afraid to go * into the streets for fear of * * and * * the air and no one would have been surprised at any hour at a general * of the peaceful * this * was shared even by the better class of * s officers i was urged to leave the city by more than one and an escort offered to be furnished me if i desired but at whatever * i resolved to remain conscious of the great service i could render my country my position giving me remarkable * for * information in * of more fearful scenes the * were leaving the city as rapidly as the means of * or * could be obtained and many even of the federal officers sent their families to the north or other places of * * at this time a number of confederate prisoners who had been taken in the first days fight when our army fell back from bull run were brought to washington and on passing * hotel were set upon by the crowd who usually * there and * with * and other * which seriously wounded a number in order to prevent the prisoners from being actually torn to pieces a company of * s * had to be called out to protect them to their quarters the old capitol prison and during the march to that point the soldiers had * to * to fire upon the * who pressed upon them with * and * * as soon as i heard of the * i went up to the prison to minister to the wants of our * and found many with severe * and * i was accompanied by my friend miss * and had the satisfaction of not only being the first friendly face seen by them but to know that i had arrived at the right time for i found there an * of lincoln i had like to have said * dressed in black with a white * who i afterwards learned was mr * wood one of the * for mrs * carriage and horses and who received his appointment in consequence * he was with great * * the prisoners and trying to * them that they would all be * unless they took the oath of allegiance to the abolition government i listened * to the man who did not seem to * the addition to his audience and afterwards as rapidly as i could assured each group of prisoners that mans * was * and only for the purpose of * and for some false * to the world that the yankees were obliged to * them as * and hold them as prisoners of war for exchange that our government would * * any * against them as we held an * of prisoners of a hundred to one this satisfied them especially the * portion who each refused the yankee pardon on the terms proposed i afterwards took the list of their various wants and in * with high parties whom it would be * to name * them with clothing and other * things food and * and * * as the yankees had made no provision of any kind save the * walls of a prison there was an * confederate * in washington for this purpose mrs * and family also * themselves in this holy work this lady was arrested in washington at the same time that i was and after a short * was sent south she then became a * of new orleans during the * of terror of butler in that city a yankee funeral passed her house and she was seen to smile upon her * during the * for this grave * she was dragged before him and * as to her * for doing so to which she * replied because i was in a good * she was * to three months * upon a * island under a * sun with soldiers rations and * to other * and * * until the poor * health gave way and her life became * the * and * of the * * who was more * than his master failed to * any * of the * sentence until the period had * when she was * an * for life in the course of her examination before butler he said i expect to be killed before i leave the south by either you or mrs * to which she answered we usually order our negroes to kill our * mr charles sumner was said to have been a * * if not an * * in that * * against * prisoners * his * was * by the sight of the * * who could hold no * * over his own * shoulders a few days after an order was given to * all visitors in which i was * named in spite however of the * i had no difficulty in * when i desired soon after i passed into other hands my share in this good work for more important * occupied my time the yankee government and yankee congress were now * upon the subject of * their * * the military committee was * charged with the task and certainly grave efforts were being made to this end the * object being to * the people as to the past in order to make them blind * in the future for it was now truly a nation of * and * at this time the solemn * was * of * as * s * the * members from western virginia i was in the gallery of the senate at the time and happened to remark upon the * to my own party when a man sitting before me in the uniform of * of yankee volunteers in company with a number of other officers turned and said that is * we will show you that it must be put a stop to we have a government to maintain c this was the first effort of the kind to * freedom of opinion which had come under my observation and the beginning of that * of terror for which we should be obliged to seek * in the age of a * or * yet i confess that it did not surprise me i leaned forward and said * my * were addressed to my companions and not to you and if i did not discover by your language that you must be ignorant of all the laws of * i should take the number of your company and report you to your commanding officer to be * for your * seeing me addressed by him several gentlemen came forward as also the * who said madam if he * you i will put him out to which i replied oh never mind he is too ignorant to know what he has done this * of the faithful meanwhile played most * with his sword and i expected * to have it drawn against me his brother officers one by one withdrew and left him alone in his glory a few moments after this scene a republican senator came up to the gallery to speak with me and i * the * and advised him to go down to the senate and move a * of the * and * law as i supposed it would come to that since armed * were placed in the * to * the crowd this brave bore it as long as possible and finally got up and went out i this man once more upon the occasion of my being * before the * s commission after i had been some eight months a prisoner he was standing in the * of the building in which the commission was held as if he expected to see me a look of triumph lighted up his face as his eye encountered mine i could not resist the * of * passing my finger across my throat and saying * as * story of the poor * * and joseph * came to my mind this was destined to be a day of * quite an excitement was caused by a * that a battle was going on across the river the confederate forces were at that time in possession of arlington heights the former residence of the * * * the * of washington from him it had come by * to our own great general lee i went with my party to the * of the * library whence the best view could be obtained and saw the smoke from the * * * up and remarked that is no battle the rebels are * their * a number of persons had crowded around and joined in the conversation some one proposed to send back to the senate for * * and * the heroic * who had fled so * from the field at manassas * the news of the defeat i * on the * of humanity as it was not right to give such a * to their nervous * since neither of those * had been able to stand the fire in their own * since that * * race finally i fell into conversation with a * * man with a big nose and a pair of green * who asked me if i had ever witnessed a battle i replied that i had * a * in the city of mexico in the course of his * he said that he would rather give up washington than that it should be held by means of * but that lincoln seward and the whole set were * and a great deal more which i considered useful information i knew that this man was a senator and * that it might be * * of * he whom i have * as * * he said that he had seen me in the gallery of the senate and asked what i thought of the * i * the attack on my liberty of speech and wondered what sort of * we should be treated to next whether a tragedy or another * and i confess gave a most * account of the * during the solemn * of the morning * my surprise that more * had not been * to * the * of the act to * and * a sovereign state of her * rights * * effort as one for which a * should have won a * cap i saw a * laugh all around and that the person to whom i spoke seemed * and finally fell back and spoke with a gentleman of my party this person came to me and said do you know that you have been talking to senator * all this while i was quite as much * at the * as any of my * but i should have considered it a reflection upon my good taste to have been previously * of the fact so assured senator * that i had no idea that the subject of my * was the patient * who stood before me but for once in your life you have heard an honest opinion * expressed * as he was i must do him the justice to say that he * very well * still continued the order of the day at washington another cry was raised that the capitol was again in danger this time the * was changed the hero of * * and of mexico was to be laid on the * to all purposes * but he still stood a mighty ruin in their way * by the * confidence of a nation and no man was bold enough to say this is not the right man for the place * and * were the * qualities called into * here seward with * skill * to support the weak old man * to * the * of the * and the * but even his * policy had to yield to the * he had * to * as a preparation for what was to follow congress passed an act * the pay of the lieutenant general in case of his resignation or * * young america now became the * of every *

to * the dreadful fate from which he so * described himself as having escaped nobody hurt and yet this same * president * his evening drive under escort of an armed guard which quite takes us back to the * * the sight pleased me i confess as a * of the gathering * i wish i could present to the minds eye a picture of washington as it really appeared under the * of the black republican rule those of its former * who remained from necessity or other causes had disappeared entirely from the * of society a new people had taken their places as * and marked in their * as any * race that ever * * and who in their * pride of * speedily * every * of * the city was filled to * with * * * office day after day and month after month the * * with black * * in hand came * in i sometimes thought them the

* of hotel or * * their * out of those same black * * on the * or * and slept like * in a * add to all this the thousands of * * soldiers who filled the streets * women into the * with * and * * and sometimes with more personal * it was even difficult to look from the windows without the sense of * being * and the public * which were once such * * had now become the chosen places of * and crime the * throughout the city had been closed as it was no longer safe for children to go into the street upon no class of the community did this * * of all the laws both human and * tell with such * effect as upon the free * * especially the women whose * * * of former days had given place under the influence of the new order of things to the most * * and who were to be seen at all public places * in * * * the smiles of the * officers and soldiers with the republican * and * i have frequently received the answer when i have sent to demand the services of a negro * that she would not come for the reason that she had an engagement to drive or walk with a yankee officer i will gladly turn from the * of this * picture to the * of high life below * being * at the white house mrs lincoln * or more probably being ignorant of the * * which have from time * * the * at the * mansion * much * and * comment upon the first public occasion after the * of her new dignity in the reception of the

addressed herself in conversation to the wife of a secretary of * and it gradually * upon the part that this was the * * of the black republican * and they made the best of the * situation mrs lincoln herself however not * to be aware that everything was not conducted in the most * * had * a little lady to * * * that she was * french and would by winter be able to * with her in that language by this she has probably discovered that there is no royal road to * i had a most * description of this scene from more than one of the * of this first republican court ceremony and only wish that i could give the picture with all its * * the young lady in the * * was a * of mrs lincoln * to the fact of mr seward being master of the * mr lincoln was a little less * in his * reception but at the

him in return the * of the * of columbia one of the most * * in the * of the executive mr lincoln had however determined to * the office upon another * who had also paid his * and who was in * waiting to receive the commission which was being made out mrs lincoln came into the presidents office asked what commission it was that he was * and on being told seized it from his hands * it in pieces

became a prisoner of state september the #* was the first time since that * period that i had had * to pen and paper all * having been * * from me by order of the heads of the war and state * and as i knew not at what hour the act of grace might be * i felt * to make the most of it as i have said on * august # 1861 as i was * my own door on returning from a * i was arrested by two men one in citizens dress and the other in the * dress of an officer of the united states army this latter was called major * and was the chief of the * * of the city they followed close upon my * i had stopped to * after the sick children of one of my * on the opposite side of the street from several persons on the * at the time en * i * some valuable information * other things it was told me that a guard had been stationed around my house throughout the night and that i had been followed during my * and had probably been allowed to * it * from the fact that a distinguished member of the * corps had joined me and accompanied me to that point this caused me to * more closely the two men who had followed and who walked with an air of conscious authority past my house to the end of the * where they stood * me i continued my conversation apparently without * them * rapidly to one of our humble * who passed those men will probably arrest me wait at * corner and see if i * my * to my face give information of it the person to whom this order was given went * along i then put a very important note into my mouth which i destroyed and turned and walked * across the street and * my own steps a few moments after and before i could open the door the two men above described rapidly * also and asked with some confusion of manner is this mrs * i answered yes they still * * i said who are you and what do you want i come to arrest you by what authority the man * or * for he had several * said by sufficient authority let me see your * he * something about * authority from the war and state * and then both stationed themselves upon either side of me and followed into the house i rapidly glanced my eye to see that my signal had keen understood and remarked quietly i have no power to resist you but had i been inside of my house i would have killed one of you before i had submitted to this * * they replied with evident * that would have been wrong as we only obey orders and both have families this scene occurred in much less time than is * to describe it i took a rapid * of the two men and in that instant decided upon my own line of conduct for i knew that the fate of some of the best and * belonging to our cause hung upon my own * and courage by this the house had become filled with men who also surrounded it outside like * from a * the * of * was upon me for i * this as the first step in that system of * which was yet to hold up this nation of * to the * of the * world this was the first act of the new * of seward * * the * step on coming into power of the young general so * an attack upon women and children and a brilliant earnest of the * to be won on his march to richmond i asked after a few moments * of the scene what are you going to do to search * replied i will * your * and going to the * i took from a * a paper * manassas july # containing these words * * * to mrs r * well but * the rest of the letter being torn off before it reached me some ten days before through the city * i * its delicate mission so kept it from an * of * and had shown it to major * of * s a captain * * * of massachusetts and several others i threw it to * saying you would like to finish this * i suppose he took it * however the city * in which i had received it my cool and * evidently * the whole party they had expected that under the influence of the * and excitement of the trying position i should have been * of some * * by which they could * an * search now commenced throughout my house men rushed with * haste into my chamber into every * my * * and * were all * * clothes were * upon with * and * exposed papers that had not seen the light for years were dragged forth my library was taken possession of and every * of paper every * line was seized even the torn * in the * or other * were carefully gathered together by these * lincoln * my library be it remembered was my * it was there also that i gave * to my children many of whose * * were * into dangerous correspondence with the enemy i was a keen * of their * * and resolved to * the truth of the old saying that the devil is no * for a clever woman i was fully advised that this extraordinary * might take place and was not to be caught at a * i had received a note a few days before * that one of * * had informed a lady in george town that i was to be arrested also that the name of the * william preston * s minister * to * who was at that time in washington stood in the * list he was * by me in time to effect his escape meanwhile i was a prisoner in one of my own * not allowed to move with stern eyes fixed upon my face to read certainly what they did not find for although * * filled my soul i was apparently * and * and i know * in the extreme my servants were * to the same * and were not allowed to approach me every effort was made to keep my arrest a secret my house * was quiet as usual three sides of it being surrounded by a high wall * the guard from observation it was considered the headquarters of the * and i being regarded as the head of the * at washington a rich * was anticipated they * without their host this time in * of all their * taken * the news of my arrest rapidly spread at eleven oclock i was taken prisoner at about three oclock my young friend miss * and her sister came to make * she had heard it in the city as she entered she was * seized by the * who stood concealed behind the door and pushed forward as was also her sister they were * at the sight of the rude * men who were in possession of my once peaceful quiet home the dear * girl put her head on my shoulder and wept for she said i did not know what they had done with you i whispered oh be * for we must * these * but before i had succeeded in completely * her the * called captain * approached and in a loud * voice demanded her name and residence as well as that of her sister we were all after this ordered to return to the back * under escort of this captain * whose duty for the time was to watch me the work of * my papers had already commenced it was indeed a hard struggle to remain a quiet * of this * but i nevertheless * myself to the task as my object was to throw the * off their guard i had no fear of * from the papers which had as yet fallen into their hands i had a right to my own political opinions and to * the question at issue and never * from the * of my * i am a southern woman born with * blood in my * and my first * ideas on state and federal matters received * and * from the best and * man of this century john c * these ideas have been * and * by reading and observation freedom of speech and of thought were my * * by our * of liberty the constitution of the united states and * and * by the blood of our fathers mr * had been the * friend of my husband and often our guest having remained several months at a time with us during his * * at washington for many years i had been * by a correspondence with him and it was my privilege to sit by his * and minister to his wants during his last illness and to * in my heart his words of wisdom and when he died i followed his remains as one of his children to his last * the * committee of arrangements of which our * * to england mr * was one having assigned me that position in the solemn * mr * walked by my side as we turned from the * and with tears * down his face made use of these words one of * * * * the * best and greatest man i ever knew he was a * senator when * was the same expression he had used in his * * of the morning mr clay in his * upon him in the senate at the same time said he was my * in everything but years after the examination of my papers by * the most * and the only * man * those * he said well madam you have no reason to feel anything but pride and satisfaction at the * you have gone through for there is not a line * your papers that does not do you honour it is the most * private correspondence that has ever fallen under my examination and the most interesting and important there is not a distinguished name in america that is not found here there is nothing that can come under the charge of * but enough to make the government dread and hold you as a most dangerous adversary but to return to the sad * of my * the search still went on i desired to go to my chamber and was told that a woman was sent for to accompany me it did not even then * upon my mind that my person was to be * i was however all the more anxious to be free from the sight of my * for a few moments so * the * of change of dress c as the day was * hot after great difficulty and thanks to the slow movements of these * of evil i was allowed to go to my chamber and then resolved to accomplish the destruction of some important papers which i had in my pocket even at the * of life the papers were my * with which i * with my friends at manassas and others of equal importance * i succeeded without such a fearful sacrifice the * * little * that a few * only stood between him and * he * at my door calling madam madam and afterwards opened it but seeing me apparently * employed he withdrew had he advanced one step i should have killed him as i raised my * with that * and so steady were my * that i could have * a glass of water on my finger without * a drop * after the female * arrived i * that the name and character of woman should be so * but she was certainly not above her * calling her * is * on my mind and as it is an * picture i would * * it as is usual with * employed in this way she was * * as if to * me with her * her face * me of one of those * * whose expression is made by * it with weak grey eyes which had a * of * like all the * she had only a christian name * i began to think that the whole * hospital had been let * for my benefit well i was * into my chamber a * standing on guard outside of the door to receive the important * believed to be * on my person nothing less i suppose than a commission of brigadiergeneral from president davis upon the principle that * president lincoln had * that distinguished * upon many who * to be old women president davis had with * * discovered qualities in a woman equally * to * i was allowed the poor privilege of * my own * which one by one were received by this * and carefully * until i stood in my * after this i was permitted to * them with the * as my * during all this time i was cool and * i had resolved to go through the trying * with as little triumph to my * as possible i had already taken the resolution to fire the house from * to * if i did not * in * certain papers in the course of the approaching night for i had no hope that they would escape a second days search my manner was therefore assumed to cover my * i was also * by the conscious * of my purpose and the high and holy cause to which i had devoted my life i felt that a people * to maintain their rights and to * * to their children the glorious * of * fathers was under the protection of that * * * which could carry me * across the burning * spread for my destruction with this * in my soul i resigned myself to the law of the * for i knew not what further trials were in store for me the orders were to * everybody who called at my house miss * and her sister were already in * mrs * who came in pursuit of her children was seized and * as also several other * visitors i know not in fact how many were taken into * for as the evening advanced i was ordered upstairs accompanied by my friends a heavy guard of * being stationed in the rooms with us a little later i had reason to regard it as a signal act of * mercy that those friends were sent me as i have said it was believed that all the * in the city were in communication with me so * who called black or white was * as an * a former * of mine and his sister in passing the house were made prisoners the man was confined below * and the young girl taken into the * with only those * men as her companions i was not aware of her being in the house until startled by a * * my first idea was that some * had been offered to my maid but being satisfied on that point i tried to believe that my sense of hearing had * me still i could not * myself of the horrible fear and after a while succeeded in sending some one down the girl was found in a state of great alarm from the * to which she had been exposed and was sent below to her brother and i now began fully to * the dark and gloomy * which * me the * of the * having gone out several of the * left in charge now possessed themselves of * and * which * in * their * * and they even * in my hearing of the nice times they expected to have with the female prisoners as every evil is said to be * by some * good i was enabled by this means to destroy every paper of consequence i had placed them where they could be found by me at any hour of the day or night and was not slow to * myself of the state of * in which the * were * * * to the library in the dark i mounted up to the * * took from the leaves of a * * papers of immense value to me at that moment * them in the folds of my dress and returned to my position on the bed without my * having * me the papers were much more numerous than i * and the difficulty was how to * of them the chance of my friends being * on going out as they were assured they should do at three oclock made me * as to that * i remembered however that in the search of my person in the morning my * and * had not been removed so miss * concealed the papers in her * and * this * of course occupied some time but it was * accomplished in the presence of the guard it was agreed between miss * and myself that if after leaving my room she learned that her person would be * she should be seized with * at leaving me and return to share the * of the * it is proper here to state that the mother of miss * was not * of this or any other * * to have * her in the difficulties * me the guard meanwhile all * continued their conversation which under the influence of the * spirits they had * became * and * i * myself to * the discussion and * their different * one against the other they were english * * and yankee i * that so unusual a * as men * in my house would * my friends of the existence of an extraordinary state of things it was a clear moonlight night and fear like death had * every sound in that section of the city it was a * conclusion as i subsequently learned i must here record a * which will go far to prove that a certain gentleman in black does not always take care of his own the chief * * having gone out on some other * of * on returning about nine oclock encountered a gentleman who was at that time * of the city and who was about to call to make a visit at my house * being ignorant of or * his official position attempted to arrest him he ran pursued by * until he reached the * quarters when * out his guard he arrested * and held him in close * until the next morning * of his * or his prayers to be allowed to send a message to lincoln or seward or * by these * means * seems to have watched over and * destruction from me between the hours of three and four on the morning of the #* my friends were permitted to * under escort of a * guard who were stationed around their houses for the following day after this i was allowed to * a few hours of * much needed after the mental and * * of that most trying day but i must also state that the two doors leading into my chamber were kept open with a guard stationed inside of each on the morning of the #* at about eleven oclock my friend miss * much to the surprise of the yankee * * returned and for several weeks shared my * for seven days my house remained in charge of the * * the search * throughout all that time as also the examination of my papers and correspondence the books in the library were all taken down and * * by * there would have been some wisdom in this the first day several large * containing books * and glass which had been * for several months were * to the like * finally * of the furniture were taken apart and even the pictures on the walls received their share of attention also my * even were * many times as some new idea would seize them i now watched their * * free from anxiety as i had under their own eyes sent off or destroyed all my papers of value the search still went on my powers of observation became * to a degree which would have made me a valuable * to the * body to whose care the abolition government had * the lives and honour of helpless women and children * i was treated with * once only were violent hands put upon my person the * captain * having * seized me to prevent my giving warning to a lady and gentleman on the first evening of my arrest which i however succeeded in doing and as the

that even my * * were * into more quiet and reserve before me although they still * to seat themselves at table with me with * hands and * the * of my * changed many times occasionally it seemed that

c according to the * * of the * parties and borne off to the war department there was one paper * them which i venture to * will never be brought to light it was a full and * account so far as could be collected of the * attempt of the abolition party to * president * and the * of the * party in washington at the national hotel a few days * to the * of president * this * scheme was very near * so far as regarded the life of president * who was for a long time in a very critical condition and it was only by the use of powerful * that his constitution * from the * of the * he told me that often

* * the above information told me also that he had obtained a * to the whole * but that mr * would not allow the affair to be pursued because of the * facts it would lay open to the world and that he * from the terrible * i considered it a great * on his part to have * the * as it might have * the john brown * and many other acts of the * conflict party between fifty and sixty persons fell * to this * * * a very large * had been offered for my * this extraordinary * had * the * of the * of the government to a very remarkable degree i had of course too much control over myself to afford any * of my knowledge of what they were * but * * and * the * were filled with * of old letters and * in * in several * from early * till late at night for seven days they * over them i had no fear one by one they had allowed the * to escape them and for what remained * himself would have required a key only once was i frightened miss * who like myself was always on the * * from a * of papers a * of * paper upon which was the whole of my despatch to manassas on july # another evidence that * watched over me as an humble * in a glorious cause i was at this time kept perfectly well posted with regard to matters outside and sometimes received valuable information through the * conversation of my * i had been already * that several of my * had been * into * hands by a spy of the name of * that a cabinet council had been * * by scott and * and that several republican * had been * * the number * of massachusetts as being * by my information the * * * the whole abolition government were at this time * with fear of the advance of our glorious army and their children were even * to sleep with the cry jeff davis is coming i had * it important that the political * then going on at washington should be clearly understood by the confederate government and as i might almost be said to have * at * cabinet * from the * i enjoyed having * reports of them as well as of the republican * i was thoroughly * to the task of giving a faithful * of their * one of the * referred to was a long letter to president davis * in * the * to get * of scott by the * * of * in which was repeated a conversation i had held with several members of the new york press as an * of the * of the times upon a proposition they had under discussion of * to * seward and * and the reasons * and * for leaving seward where he was that his * policy was less * to * and strength that he would never * any * measures that if the * which seemed * cried for the abolition of slavery or renewed * for its protection he would * himself to it or to anything else which could * to his * that his genius lay in his * of drawing to himself all the * of any successful measure and of * out of the way of an * one that * of the new york * had understood him perfectly and had said of him in reply to my remark that seward was the only * * the black republican party he has not the first principle of a * he is a miserable political * and has been the * of every * measure in this state from * down to * he has not blood enough in him to * an honest opinion on any subject but wishes to be a great man and will * to anything for power that the * * had gone to seward and repeated to him some portion of this conversation and that he seward had * to the * of his hair but had appointed an hour to receive him for the * certain * he had to make on the part of the new york press on the peace question that the * after this conversation came to me and proposed that i should give him a * to general beauregard with a * that he would forward him to richmond from which city he could write a peace letter that mr seward * the idea he then said suppose you go to manassas and let me go under your protection i said that would be impossible he replied quickly oh i have arranged all that with seward i said you * me your reputation is so bad that no lady would travel in your company that * by this he then said but will you give me a letter which will take me through to richmond i will be willing to go * and be put in a * after i get there so that i may write the letter to which i replied i have no authority to grant your request and so far from giving you * for carrying out your wishes i should consider president davis * in his duty if he did not cause any man to be * who would do what you * that peace now upon any other * than separate independence was out of the question and that if he had any desire to aid in the * of that * end he had better through the new york papers * to * the minds of the people on the subject that we of the south had been driven to draw the sword in * defence c i told of * * which were not then generally known of * plans for * the army in short of all that was proposed or being done by the yankees the second despatch was entirely in * but contained * * of some * and weak points which they * as being equal to those of their best * as well they might besides information of importance in case our army advanced on washington my letter was pronounced a very able * i had at least the satisfaction of knowing that lincoln and the assembled wisdom of * did justice to the * with which a southern woman * her * duty their * * me to a most dangerous * and they * whether i should not be * tried for * and made an example of the effort to obtain my * was with the hope of * direct evidence against me such as would be * in court upon a public trial and as a * to the world for their extraordinary * for which there had been no * in a * age save in france during the revolution my social position was such that they did not dare follow the * of their first excited * in * of me for in their own ranks i had many devoted friends who * expressed their admiration of the position i took under the circumstances of danger and difficulty which * me mr davis directed me in a despatch received at this time to give up the * if i could thereby obtain any advantage this * * of the president left me free to follow my own judgment and destroy it for reasons * to me and * with * to others actually engaged and still * my * were all written and received at this time under a * de * and yankee * and * had even at this early day exhausted itself in efforts to * me into an * or * which would compromise me or my friends they had had the * to * a report that for a large * i had engaged to * my cause and * my party but i thank god that they did not * in * the confidence of my friends which was an important object that i could have made my own terms with them can easily be seen from the importance they attached to my capture they had the * to * to me through their * that a graceful * on my part would be most * * to by the government and when i replied that if this was in * of the report they had set in * an attempt to * me my only * would be that for * or * i had cast my lot as god and nature directed and that their whole * treasury could not * me to * the * agent of our cause i was asked if i knew that my life was in danger and that probably to save my neck i might answer * to which i replied that the life of any one is in danger when in the power of * * beyond that i had no * for their own * * me as they knew * * would follow an attempt on my life on * the 29th the yankee government went through the * of offering to * my house and furniture i asked to be allowed to see a * for * and was told that they would not grant me that right i then answered that as a prisoner i was not * to any * act and that i declined all * with them that they had already * and destroyed and * all that i * in the house and that they might continue to hold it by the same * * that of * force as i would not become a party to my own * this i said to * * who came on the part of the government and to do him justice he appeared * ashamed of his mission general butler was with * and other * in the * office when captain * went to report the result of his mission which he did in terms * to me * with the remark that he felt like * the * from his shoulders from a sense of * at the part he was forced to play as he stood before the noble woman butler said if the government will take my advice and * that * * to my care at * * i * to put her through an * which will no longer * the * of our officers c c * a * * made a * of his horse but lincoln has * him in * by making of butler the * a military governor my object in seeing a * was of course not with the * hope of * my property but up to this time the * * had not been * and i wished to force the issue between the civil and military authorities as a means possibly of * the coming * i was informed by the man * that i knew my rights too well and that the government did not intend to afford me the means of * them i did however in spite of their * * in sending a message and note to judge black late * of the united states and to the * r j * * them to call upon me but those grave * gentlemen * by * * or sympathy with the * * gave no * to my request and i was thus left in the hands of an * * enemy with only my own judgment to guide me to show the utter * of the abolition government and the extraordinary means they * * to to * * into their * ranks it was now * published that our great and good president had died in richmond a few weeks after the battle of manassas he was said to have died of a slow fever brought on by great mental anxiety and * at the share he was supposed to have had in bringing about the revolution that he had breathed his last sigh at twenty minutes to six in the morning that his * * and family and friends were present that his mind was clear and that he * * his friends to * their allegiance to the united states and to do all in their power to put down the revolution the * were reported to be at * at arlington heights manassas and all other points in our possession and that minute guns were fired during the day this account went through the whole north and was the cause of immense * for our president had filled them with fear and dread in * to the confidence and * with which he had * every * on * morning the 30th of august i was informed that other prisoners were to be brought in and that my house was to be * into a prison and that miss * and myself and little girl and servant were to be confined in one room after considerable difficulty and * with the secretary of war another small room was allowed for my child and maid with the * however that i should not go into it as it was a front room with a window on the street subsequently my library was also * to me my * were * of their furniture which was * into the chamber for the use of the prisoners by this time i had become perfectly * everything showed * of the * those * * * the * * had rolled themselves in my fine * their mark was visible upon every chair and sofa even the chamber in which one of my children had died only a few months before and the bed on which she lay in her * had been * by these * of lincoln and the various articles of * which lay on her * as she had left them were borne off as * * every * association with my home had been * * my * had become my prison the law of the land had been * by the higher law of the abolition * and i could only say o lord how long will this * be permitted but i * from my story soon armed men filled the house the * of whose * * through it like the voice of * i was confined to my chamber at the door of which two soldiers stood * in hand the * below told me that other prisoners were * they were the * family mrs * and her two * daughters and her sister miss * a silent * en * was all we were allowed to exchange these ladies had been arrested the day after i was and were * to the like if not greater * from which the presence of the husband and the father could not protect them and now they were dragged from their own homes the mother from her little children several of whom were * of tender age her house * her papers * without finding anything to base even a * upon the only * against her really being that she was a southern woman and a lady * association with the * whom the * of the revolution had brought to the * of society another prisoner was to be confined in the room * mine a heavy bar of wood had been * across the door between so as to prevent all communication she was brought in late at night her deep and * * broke on the * of the hour i sat by the door and heard the officer in charge call her name it was mrs * of whom i had some previous knowledge but had she been a stranger her * lot would have established a claim to my sympathy i had sent to this persons house the night of my arrest to * her but found her house already in charge of soldiers and my * * escaped arrest i was of course * anxious to let her know that she was in my house and to * with her she had been * to me as a * * by colonel * had successfully served in that capacity several times and it was through her means most * however that my * had been * into the hands of the government special care was taken to prevent this prisoner and myself from * as they hoped through her to * direct evidence against me the morning after her arrival i * the attention of the guard * miss * slipped into her room and * her to deny all knowledge of me which was however limited to the fact of her having been an agent of communication poor woman she had been most * used dragged from her own * to a * where she had been kept for a whole week lying on a * * without * or pillow * the * and most * class of the community and her nervous system had been completely * by it all * between the prisoners was * had we been * to the * * more * measures could not have been * miss * was allowed to see her mother and sisters only in the

the * which occurred in these first days under the eyes of the * * i had received and answered * from my friends * them had been the order from my president to give up my * upon * * i am * by * * from

faith in the * of the * would * the most * to deeds of daring the idea of the yankees at first was to hold me up * before the eyes of the public as a terrible example and a warning in this they * failed for i became even * their own people an object of interest and one of their own papers the new york times some months later said had madam * been sent south immediately after her arrest as we * we should have heard no more of the heroic deeds of * women which she has made the * on the #* of september my child was taken very ill in consequence i wrote to * porter asking that my family

under the * of * the body of his brother and this man i could have proved to have been in the pay of our army and had furnished some valuable information mr seward in spite of the * of his * * * enough of his * * to know that in so grave a matter as trial for * the charge must be * by two * * and that any case made out against me upon the evidence before them would have been * from every

ears his * * he * bitterly of having been * and * treated before he was allowed to see her and exhibited his torn hat in evidence his great object he said was to fall upon some plan of * with me as he had information of importance for me and asked her if she could * this * had been all arranged at the * * by general porter and his * * captain * being * to the suggestion of * the hat i had been * of

was perfectly well c he wrote a * for miss * in english every word of which was * and * himself * * i * mentioned the * of a * writing a * in other than * by some means my * reached him so on the * of

that his visits were * on my * * to me and requested that they might be * it will hardly be * that after this i should have been subject to the * again on the day * he came in as usual with * * not even * to * at my door i took no notice of him but sent for lieutenant * to take charge of my * * against the * of the * this he did making also * * which relieved me from further * * about this time a * in the rear of my * home my prison caught on fire through the * of some * soldiers by whom it was occupied it * the * alarm the whole of the * * by captain * rushed to the scene of action and

had to be repulsed at the point of the * this * statement was * by a high * to the * and courage of captain * for having defeated this * effort to * justice which was furnished i was told by himself somewhere about the #* of september * * m * accompanied by * colonel key came to see mrs * and family to make arrangements for their being sent south on * which was effected a day or two afterwards mr * came also to see me i had of course no idea of the position he was subsequently to hold in the abolition cabinet neither had he at that time after some * conversation he asked me what i had done to

wished to * him as my * to obtain a * of * * this he declined accompanied by * of high * and * of service in any other way to which i of course attached no value i had previously applied to judge

like an * over the land * civil liberty and * in its * an * military * i felt now that i was alone and that the wall of separation from my friends was each hour growing more formidable a new * was also put upon me miss * who up to this time had remained with me was on the #* of september * taken away and all * or communication with me * so rigid had become the * that persons were * under * of arrest from walking or driving by the prison a * * * poor * * which so * and * her that she often prayed for the protection of her * * and heavily now passed the days and weeks another plan was also adopted to * me to * my food which up to this time though plain and often * had been sufficiently * was now so reduced in * and * as to be * often to * the * of * my child as well as myself suffered greatly under this new * i wrote to * porter * against this * but he turned a * ear to my * and my little rose who was allowed to play on the * under escort of a guard was often * to the kind friends who sent her food * there that she should not cry herself to sleep from * those yankee * of the * fathers had * upon the * practice of burning and hanging and * their enemies by * and * * an * was now * more * more * to me as a woman than any which had * it a woman of bad * known and * by several of the guard as such having been seen in the streets of * in the exercise of her * calling herself mrs

here again my thanks are due to lieutenant * for so soon as the character of the woman became known to him he * her to her apartment in which she frequently received mr * seward * of state mr * private secretary of the secretary of state and other persons * connected with the government it might have been supposed that my former social position and that which members of my immediate family still held in the federal city would have * me from this attempt to * me but surprise will * when the character of this people has been exhibited more clearly and the * and * * brought by them to bear * the social relations of life exposed under the system established by mr seward of the secret * a spy was in every household these were often selected from the higher * of society as witness mrs and mrs of baltimore and * and mrs of washington city by such means the * of home was * every * expression uttered within its sacred * was sure to reach the ears of the secret * those * of america who less * than their eastern * who * their * of their coming fate by a * * in the wall entered the houses and the * of women and children at the dead of night * them from their * and * alike of tears and prayers forced them to * their * under the eye and often * the * * of their rude and * * one young girl to my knowledge died from the shame and horror of this * and yet this people with the deep * of their acts before them dare to * their mission to be the * of the constitution and the * of the union i often wonder that the * of heaven do not strike them as they utter the * lie their leaders now in all private * when they * themselves secure * announced their real determination to * slavery * of new york one of their most * members of the lower house told me that he did not care a rush for the flag that that was a * for the ignorant and that if he thought that by this war the old union could be restored with its constitutional * for slavery that he would not vote a * or a man no he said it was for * * his party fought and they were now strong enough to * their true policy the * henry * said the country had been * long enough by southern * and that his party would * their principles at the point of the * and as to maryland they had put the iron * upon her and would crush out her * lines * of * one of president * most * * and united states senator said in a conversation which i held with him at the time of the * attempt to * fort sumter in answer to a * of mine on the subject it is true a great many lives may be lost and we may not * in * fort sumter but the president was * by a northern majority and they are now becoming * and the president * it to them to strike some blow by which he will make a united northern party * of * island said that if the * could not be * in any other way he was for the abolition of slavery as a certain means of * the south to a state of * i state these * and i might add many more to the list in order to show that even at this early day when the * step in the revolution had scarcely been taken all * was thrown aside as to the real object of the war that of * of the south by means of general * of the slaves mrs * was at this time * upon taking the oath of allegiance and making a full * of all she had done or knew i was * glad of it she had paid * for a * * her sympathy or connection with our cause being confined to the * of a few letters for this she was * two months in solitary * and it required the stern faith of the * of old to * the * of our lord * the first but even this was not done as an act of justice to the victim whose health had become seriously * but by the kindly * of a lady who * as * an influence over the * secretary of war * * as the celebrated madame * * did over the grandfather of * * it would be impossible to record the daily * * * to which i was exposed every article of clothing which went to the * had to be * by the * of the guard in presence of the officer of the guard upon one occasion the * of the guard on sending out some article of clothing for one of the prisoners * this duty for which he was tried * to the ranks with * for thirty days and loss of pay for three months thus it will be seen that whatever * may have been felt by an officer in the * of this task it was * upon him by order of the * * who seemed to have had some original ideas on the subject of the * of * * although none on the subject of * the * was set in * one day * by captain * on account of a * of * having reached me without going through the usual examination the abolition government had been for some time * the minds of its * subjects with a new scheme for the * of the south the greatest * expedition since that of * * for the * of england because good queen * turned a * ear to his * scheme was being * out and * of * or * * it was also called the great * every * of modern * was employed in * and * this vast * so as to * the greatest amount of death and * to our unhappy * southern land twenty thousand picked troops were sent as a part of the expedition and most terrible of all burnside was to command it going south to look for his hat and his * which he had lost at manassas it would be * to record the * which possessed me as day by day i followed through the new york * the progress of the preparation and final * and * of the men the * of this formidable * now became an affair of vast moment and i * in my mind the various means by which this * information could be obtained accident * this * for knowledge better than any plan however well arranged could have done we are told that * * sometimes and mr secretary seward who in the morning is the most * man in the world * * * famous * that language is given to * thought is after supper and under the influence of the generous * which the gods provide the most * and * i have often had occasion to * the * of his nature on these occasions and wondered if the judgment of the world was correct in * to him the character of a * * and * * it was upon one of these * occasions when the mind of the great * had become * * and his thoughts * above the * * which * his genius during the * * business hours that he addressed himself to the task of * a distinguished foreign * whose views i am sorry to say were not * to his own as to the utter * of the southern cause and * him that in thirty days a * period of his the * would be crushed out * this melancholy fact by * in * this * * and the * course it was * to take this important information was * to me by my little bird * it was the bird sent out from the * and did not return and now came back to me with better than the * i leave this as an * * but being satisfied by other means of the * of the intelligence i lost no time in preparing one of those peculiar square * written in that * for which a very large amount had been offered and with a prayer to * god for its safe * committed it to my faithful bird and sent it across the waters to general beauregard to be * to our great and good president at richmond i might describe if i * the danger that my poor bird passed over and how it at one time took * in the * of the enemy and other things of * interest but this would indicate the course of the * * and * the future i learned at this time that dr * formerly united states senator for * was in washington a prisoner although at large and i desired very much to * to him * some details which would have been useful to our government but which i did not dare write as it would have * the safety of a friend whose position was one of * under the yankee government i wrote a note to dr * * this fact and that i could * with perfect safety a personal interview i laugh now at the description of the * terror on receiving my note and his earnest appeal for gods sake not to attempt to * with him for he was surrounded by the * * c he had not learned that * was his * to do * impossible things the * * had now set in and the * * and * of the * as it swept along fell on my ear like the soft * of sweet music the abolition feet had been a little too * in its movements to * the full benefit of the * * still it was * * several * being * a large number of horses and * of * stores also were thrown * thereby * considerable delay before the great * finally set forth upon its * * meanwhile my despatch reached richmond i was very much startled one day somewhere about the 1st of october at receiving a proposition from a yankee officer to aid in * my escape the first idea that flashed upon me was for i confess that my * of * had been * * by the events of the last few months that this was a * to * some of my friends or for the purpose of * a * for * me to a northern prison whatever my * were i * it * to give no * of them so i * to the * as if i believed it made in good faith and opened communication with a friend on the subject warning my friend * however of my * and giving instructions as to the * to be followed all things worked * the real * which i had in view and which i * from * for reason that it might afford an * * having been effected i threw grave * in the way of the * of the heroic * and it was finally abandoned from * want of resolution on my part to * it i can hardly tell now how my time was passed i had gone through the heat of * into the autumn the * of my * * all the while my food so * that for days i had lived upon * and * i was not even allowed to take exercise in the yard and was * informed that a proposition was * as to whether my windows should not be * up so as to * me of light as a means of * me into the terms of the government during all this period i was shut out from all * or communication with my friends the * was * no one was allowed to see me even the religious * which is * to the * * in the christian * of europe was denied me several members of the holy * * applied to see me and were repulsed with great * at the * as being * of * and * i wrote to * whether the * had made a * compact with the devil by which my child and maid were to be given over to destruction as well as myself * him that there was no * in * with the gentleman in black the system of * * of government * was at this time being * * and asking that the privilege might be * them of going to church this was granted for the * sunday and occasionally afterwards but always under escort of a guard whose orders were to sit in the same * and allow no communication with * one morning as i opened my * to pass to the library i saw the * * * an old lady up the * who had great difficulty in * even with his assistance it was the * mother of the * jackson and i * her grey * as being his mother more than if a * had * her brow she was placed in the room * mine the bar of wood having been removed after the last * left the guard however were not aware of this fact and i was * as i heard the * double the guard and order that no one was to * with the prisoner i * opened the door between our * and mounted over a * which stood across the entrance she sprang forward at seeing one of her own * i rapidly * her by * to the door leading into the hall placed my finger on my lips and softly approached her when the * lady folded me in her arms and gave me the information which i have stated above as to who she was i then * at her feet and she rapidly poured into my ear * of the * world she told me that she had been dragged from her bed at midnight that she had been only allowed to throw a * * over her * and that even in the presence of her * and was thus brought forth my heart * to see this noble woman of * years * to such an * but she proved herself worthy of being the mother of her brave son she * to me the * history of his * murder and how his body had been * to the floor by the * and kept there for many hours for them to * over until his * wife with her own feeble hands dragged it forth for christian * she told me also of the heroic deeds of our brave soldiers which filled my heart with pride and * and i bowed my head in her lap and said mother give me your blessing and the old * words of god bless you and give you * strength my child seemed to * me with new courage for what was to come soon the officer of the guard returned the terrible bar was placed in the door and i did not again enjoy the privilege of speaking with the mother of jackson neither was i allowed to minister to her comfort she was kept in a room without fire or * the weather being very cold until about twelve oclock at night when she was * jackson had been one of the first * of this war of * he was a * of alexandria * before the * of that city by the yankee forces a * party under * a new york * and * * into alexandria one morning about daylight when * seeing the virginia state flag * from jacksons house * himself from his party and rushed into the house to * it down jackson was * from sleep in time to kill the daring * who had thus * his rights and was himself * a short time afterwards under circumstances of great * by the remainder of the * who then spread themselves through the city * and * * upon women of * for this four of their number were * to be shot but their escape was subsequently * at by the authorities a few days after this a miss * or * was brought in on the #* day of november i received a visit from my sister mrs james madison * and my * the * mrs * a * accompanied by colonel * * the permit to see me making the presence of an officer during the interview * and * it to fifteen minutes i had been so * * communication with my kind that i had long since arrived at the conclusion that all human kindness had taken flight along with my * of the south and left this * city of washington with its unfortunate * at the mercy of the * * colonel * earnestly * my graceful * to the government and kindly offered to * in my behalf with secretary seward i declined this * * and * of aid as * with my own feelings and * to my honour i had now been three months a prisoner with no charge preferred against me or reason assigned for the * act and i determined to address a * letter to mr seward the secretary of state on the subject hoping to obtain some * of a matter certainly of personal interest to me this i did on the #* of november i also sent a copy of this letter to my friends at manassas with no idea or intention however of its ever being given to the public and i confess that at first i was deeply * at the * but when i afterwards knew the * and * of the * at having the * of their * laid bare i became perfectly satisfied of the superior wisdom of my friends in giving it * as a part of my story i * the letter the contest between the different divisions of the * for the * was now carried on with quite as much heat and bitterness as had ever * the * of the two great sectional parties upon the * questions of constitutional rights * had been brought forward as a necessary * for the * of scott without any idea however of * him * upon the party but he had taken * * the less * * of it

with an * guard * to watch her and although i paid for my own * it was often two or three weeks before i could send out my clothes i was also obliged to buy my own * as the government refused to allow me any lieutenant * had been ordered under arrest upon the charge of taking out * for me but was * by order of seward my poor friend miss * with whom i kept up * communication in spite of all the * was * in her efforts to see me in turn she * every member of the cabinet and finally went to lincoln whose reception of her was * of the man he told her that she had had too much of my * already that i had done more to * and bring his government into * than all the rest of the * rebels together and by * she should never see me again if he could help it this was * * i however sent him word that * he was engaged in the * task of * a prisoner and that prisoner a woman i was far more * occupied in making a new * for him to * washington in the dear girl was however almost * for she loved me well and made a last appeal to * * j porter who * upon his * * * in a * against me and * by * saying that he wondered why he had not already arrested her she left him in tears * bitterly the way home retired to her bed from which she never after rose * wrote me that same evening a full account of the above which reached me through my * * she grew rapidly worse and in little more than a week from the above period she was dying throughout her illness she prayed to see me and a few hours before the fatal event was so earnest in her prayer saying that she could not die * unless she was * that although late at night her mother sent to the * his reply was that he had not the authority to grant the permission and that it rested with the secretary of state seward * i wrote to seward asking the privilege of visiting my dying friend subject to any * he might * his reply was * to the * * a copy of which was sent me and so my darling faithful friend was laid in her grave and the cold earth shut out her beautiful loving face for ever from my eyes i could not then * but i prayed that the god of justice would in his hour of need deny the * * that mercy which he dressed in his brief authority had denied to me captain * * services in the * department were at last * by * which * him to a new field of action and he was succeeded by captain * whose * conduct * a striking * on * his position he wrote me a most * and kind letter offering any service not * with his duty as an officer of the united states and although his acts were always * by the most * * to his own government he was ever

excuse for approaching very near in conversation the second time i saw him he attempted to take my hand as he said to find out whether i had ever done any work i withdrew it saying that my head had * more than my hands upon this occasion however his manner was * and earnest he expressed anxiety to serve me said that he had thought my * * that he was opposed to the policy of * women and that although he came now without being * * to speak with me on the subject of my * he was free to tell me that he had held * with some of the heads of the government on the subject and that they were greatly * to know what to do with me i answered oh yes they dare not * me are afraid to * me and would like to * me to escape in order that they might catch me and spirit me away having in mind the effort made a short time previous to * me to attempt to escape he * continued the government have come to the conclusion that it is of no use to attempt to make terms with you that between you and them it is do your worst to the end of the war and the only way left is to * you as the british government did smith * * you he then said quickly what terms would you be willing to * my heart beat * for even that chance * of freedom * me i however crushed down the * for i saw that he was watching me very * and answered none sir i demand my * * * for my losses and * of my papers and * he said these last i cannot * for i know that your papers will not be given up and all the * of rebels will be * i may not he continued be able to accomplish anything in regard to your personal freedom as there is a very strong influence against you but i * you had better let me make the best terms i can i replied freedom is sweet and although i have suffered much there are many things * to me and i will not compromise a principle even though i am * as a prisoner for the war the sentence i learn already pronounced against me he * his head and then spoke of still greater * to which i might be exposed and * himself greatly interested in my situation i told him that i would require time to think over all he had said and that i was at the present * * to * a conference upon the subject and that i would desire him to call again he requested me to write to him through the * office as he could not venture to call otherwise as it would subject him to the * of southern * this will serve as another * of that iron * which * even the exercise of ordinary humanity this man was a native of maryland and paid the * of * to his state by the * * of his new * on * mrs * sent through the * office a large * and other little * to my little girl which made her very happy and bright lieutenant * also by a * of authority allowed her to go out and join in the * of the day at the houses of several of

immediately to follow on the #* i received a note by my little bird warning me that an attempt would be made to remove me to a northern prison that a telegram had been sent to fort warren to hold in * a room for me there at the same time i was assured that i should be * in case this was done that my friends only awaited my orders that my prison was watched by them day and night and * agreed upon c

now * to this * * as a means of * their * spite as well as to * me with a * dread for the future it is difficult to estimate * the extent of the power and influence * by this * * it had so * upon the

#* an order was given that the prisoners should not leave their quarters after six oclock this had clearly no reference to me as i never went beyond my own * but it confined miss * to hers * she had one of those remarkable * * which i have described before the officer of the guard now returned from the * and the * came to * to me that the * had been removed and i was at liberty to go to my

not imagine what the unfortunate woman had been doing to have brought this * upon herself i attempted to enter my chamber and was told that i could not go into it hearing the sound of * voices within i * * that mr * secret * were at work in order to obtain the copy of the second letter i had written to him a few days before but as in the first instance my copy had gone out * with the original which was held back until that object had been accomplished i returned to the library and destroyed all the papers which i feared to fall into their hands in about two hours the officer of the guard came to the library looking as pale as marble followed by the * and two of the guard all armed the officer having on his * and sword and the others with * and * * in the distance were the shadows of

north window of the library had been * and * up and my journal and every * of paper had been taken from my * and table and upon * my * i found that several valuable articles of clothing had been * whether this had been done by the * or the guard i am not prepared to say on the morning of the #* i sent to the officer of the guard to demand pen * and paper also that i might be allowed to * the * he returned for answer that general porter had ordered that i should not be allowed to have either i sent a second time to say that i wished to write to the * colonel key * he sent me a single * of paper and pen and * i wrote that same day to colonel key * that i was now prepared to hear what he had to say to me further upon the subject of my * with a courtesy very remarkable for an * of the abolition government he came immediately on the * of my note but appeared * and ill at ease he told me that circumstances had occurred since i last saw him which made him fear that he had lost all power to serve me he asked me what proposition i had to make i replied that in my last interview i had * my position and stated my * he said it had been spoken of to send me north but that it had been * to on the ground that i might * * * against the government which would give them some trouble i replied which i should most * do he said unfortunately the * of my letter to seward and another * in terms of still greater bitterness had aroused great * against me and he * whether the subject of my * would be now entertained i replied that i did not question his * as he had given me a strong reason in the fact that he was going with * into virginia in support of it but i very much * whether the parties who had * him to speak on the subject with me had been honest * in their * but had rather * through that means to obtain some * from me i then * the late * visit to which i had been * upon this he made no comment but * * to the power * against me and left me saying that he would return in a short time after * with parties whom he would not name he did return in about two hours and gave me the very * information that on account of the dangerous extent of the knowledge i possessed it was * * to * me he refused to tell me whose influence had been * against me but i already knew that it was seward and * * by the * * from the rough notes in my possession i am enabled to supply a copy of my letter to seward of december #* by a * which it would not be safe to explain the copy which i sent out never reached the hands for which it was * this letter was written * to the surrender of our commissioners * and * and i cannot be supposed to have been very * that mr seward should * the dignity of * neither did i expect that he would for i knew that his * would * from * the responsibility of the acts of his agent * at the same time that his * and * would afford a * * for the real feelings which * his decision * and * alone * me i had known seward * and he had frequently enjoyed the * of my table and at a time when few had the moral courage to countenance him upon his return from europe * after the miserable * john brown had paid the * of his crime mr seward was * at my house with a large party * whom were mr and mrs charles * * an unfortunate * was made to some circumstances connected with the affair at harpers ferry when mrs * * out into a * on john brown calling him that holy * and * turning her glance full upon me at the time to which i replied in a clear and * voice for it may be supposed that this conversation * all other i have no sympathy for john brown he was a * and met a * * and turning to seward i remarked i think you * very good taste in * all connection with john brown in your speech a few days since in the senate in reply he said i remember to have met him once and but once only he called on me about some matter of business the nature of which i dont now * he struck me as a wild and * man * in his ways and * striking in his appearance but at the same time in our brief interview he impressed me with the * that he was a bold * and honest man but * to a degree * on an * state of mind i was at this time busy with my preparations for going to europe and * crowded with affairs and the interview entirely passed from my mind until this unfortunate * in which i have been sought to be * and which clearly * the * of my original * as to the * state of his mind colonel george magruder remarked that his conduct at harpers ferry had not * mr * impression of his character as it proved that he was not free from fear from the * of lying and of * and of * seward replied in an * tone i knew nothing about him only saw him once for a few moments and the impression was very much * by the new scenes through which i have since passed the conversation at this point * and seward * me with great skill in * it into a new * mr * who was sitting on the other side of me remained perfectly silent i should have * from the most distant * to these * had they not become matters of public * president * spoke to me on the subject to which i replied do you keep * in my household i was very much * for i had hoped that the social * of so humble an individual as myself would have escaped observation he said how you talk i have heard it spoken of by five or six persons who all greatly * your spirit and independence and you have my most * * * henry d * of massachusetts told me also that the black * * mrs * very much and thought the * on her part very * a few days after i encountered mr seward and he approached me saying i have just been writing to our friend lady * and have told her that in all washington you were the only person who had the independence to give a * dinner party * to the strong social lines of division which were then drawn between the southern and northern parties i replied and you may also add that i am so well satisfied with the result of that * that i shall not try it again perhaps had he * my real object he would not have been so grateful to me for the social countenance at this early day i saw * what was to follow and i desired to obtain a * * into the plans and * of those who were destined to become the prominent * in the fearful * in order that i might turn it to the advantage of my country when the hour for action arrived to this end i employed every capacity with which god

went on her way * the woman * also applied to be * upon similar terms which was refused and she was sent to the old capitol prison upon which occasion i saw her for the first time at about four oclock i turned my back upon what had once been a happy home and what was to me an additional grief parted from my faithful maid who had thus far stayed with me through all my trials and served me with a * and devotion not often * in the higher * of life my child wept bitterly on parting from her and i confess that the * * of the faithful creature to be allowed to follow my gloomy * * * me the majority of the guard were drawn up in front of the house to witness my departure several them had been very kind and on taking leave i said i trust that your next duty will be a more * one than that of * helpless women and children i cast my eye up and saw that the windows were all crowded with men * whom i * several * of the new york and philadelphia press eagerly watching my words and looks i reached the old capitol prison just at dark but whether in * of some * on the part of my friends i know not but the whole guard were under arms to receive me a general * was visible in all * and it was evident that a great deal of interest and curiosity was felt as to the * of so noted a rebel the * or office was crowded with officers and others all * at me it was with a strange feeling of * that i found myself in this prison i had already gone through so many trials that this * act of * could only * a smile of * i now parted from lieutenant * who had * himself to my most grateful * his kindness to me had exposed him to the * of his own government and it was through his * that i was now enabled to * some few * * from the general * of my * so soon as i left the house the members of

the public i have thought fit to give a few * from some of them this brought no * but i was subsequently informed that lieutenant * was * placed under arrest although he was in the order of * again in command at the prison i can give no idea of the * * to which i was constantly exposed i was never allowed to cross my chamber door if a servant now entered to * the * duty the door was immediately locked and * so that it was necessary to * or call some five or ten minutes before they could get out and when it is remembered that these servants were often negro men who claimed perfect * and would * tell me that * lincoln had made them as good as me that they would not be called negroes but * of * some idea may be felt of the * * feeling of * that was constantly upon me it is but justice to the * of the prison mr wood to state that whenever the * of the negroes came to his knowledge that he * sent them away and that so far as he was able to do so he * the prisoners from the * and * of the guard and officers the * with regard to my child were * rigid the act of * ran thus miss rose * although not a prisoner is subject to the same * and * * for a prisoner she was in fact as much a prisoner as i was i had never been * on the subject and when occasionally from very shame she was allowed to go down in the yard the child often came up crying from the * of the * and * to which she was exposed the * was as i have above said disposed to be kind but there was a constant struggle going on between him and the military authorities for * by which the comfort of the prisoner was * and his liberty * it would seem to have been * arranged that these * * should result in * * over the helpless * i can * no more horrible * than that which was now my lot at nine oclock the * were put out the roll was called every night and morning and a man * in to see that a prisoner had not escaped through the * the walls of my room * with * and i was obliged to * a portion of the precious hours of * in burning them on the wall in order that myself and child should not be * by them in the course of the night the bed was so hard the i was obliged to * up my clothing and place them under my child in spite of this she would often cry out in the night oh * the bed * me so much the portion of the prison in which i was confined was now almost entirely * into negro quarters * of whom were daily brought in the rooms above and below mine being * to their use and the * and * of negro children * was most dreadful the * which * my view * with them * both sight and * for the air was rank and * with the * from their bodies and the language which fell upon the ear and * which met the eye were too * to be * for it must be remembered that these * were of both * * together * as close as they could be * * from all control and suddenly * with constitutional rights they considered the exercise of their * will as the only means of * their * in addition to all other * was the terrible dread of * * several cases of * * and my child had already taken the * which had broken out * them my clothes when brought out from the * were often filled with * constantly articles were * * on this head of

woman up dare wants you and by way of still further * the satisfaction with this condition of things captain * of the #* pennsylvania volunteers * these negroes just below my window i * against these * and threatened to make an appeal to the united states senate to send a committee to * into our present * condition as they had done in the case of the negro * and * confined in the * many of whom

* * the * * of * whose * they were trying to * its * had taken a far more extended range than was * intended the newspapers in * with * * sometimes lifted the * and gave the public a * at the nature of the * with which the committee had charged themselves and they were certainly of a very extraordinary character the most remarkable being the charges against mrs lincoln of * c mrs lincoln was said to have * from a new york * * a dinner service of * for the white house to be paid for by the government for which the * presented a bill to mr lincoln for the * of # dollars that he refused to pay the * price and sent for a * * of washington to * as to the real value who * it at about # dollars that the new york * still insisted on his original demand telling mr lincoln * that he had better pay it without further question that lincoln * to know what he meant the * finally gave the history of the * as follows that the real price of the * had been # dollars but mrs lincoln had directed him to make out the bill for # and hand over the * to her the nature of some of these charges can be better understood by the * defence which the new york * thought fit to make of her character and domestic * it * the attempt of the committee to * with the * domestic relations of president lincoln and his wife said that she should be like * wife above * c this was very noble and * on the part of the * but the committee were * with things as they were and not as they ought to be although they afterwards came to the conclusion that it was * with the good of public * that their * should be published it will however at some future day form a curious * to the history of the times in the hands of some * of the rise and fall of the * * which has been more recently * as the best government the sun

result proved even more * to the abolition army than the first they could no longer * themselves as to the * of the fighting qualities of the enemy they had to * with it had been * at manassas and equally * at * * where the * * * met his just * and they were now to learn that this * southern * whom they reported at manassas to have laid down behind their trenches too * to * their own guns which

to recover from the last * of arms added * to * by holding them in check with * guns actually * with success the * system of * against these * * of the * century it was at this time that i replied to the * made by some yankee officers of the * * of our army we will not fight you at manassas but will lead you on to the chickahominy where we will welcome you to * * after the * * this chance * was published in the new york * and other papers as an evidence of my * communication with the army at manassas and the prince de * in his * letter for * defeat says he was forced to * his plans in

against me and to what results it would be * to lead it was one of those * * days in which the cold * to the * the sun was * by clouds as dark as yankee deeds and heavy * of snow were falling thick and fast as i drove through the avenue from the prison to the * * office which was at the other end of the city the * and * were * for even in those first days of the * the * had not been so visible however i had no time for reflection upon the * which the present and the past presented as by this time the carriage drew near the * but here truly was there room for comparison this had been the house of mrs * one of the most * and agreeable in the city and as i passed up through the * * and * and the * crowd of soldiers and * who * the way my mind * * to the gay and brilliant scenes in which i had mingled in that house and the * company who had enjoyed its * i was conducted to the third story and put in room without fire and kept there until my hands and feet were completely * with cold a guard was stationed at the door who * his * in order that i should have a comfortable sense of his * numbers of officers in gay * came in upon one * or another in order to * at me i was * in this manner for nearly an hour when the * of the old capitol prison mr wood in whose * i was still regarded as being came to conduct me before the commissioners whose presence i reached with difficulty a passage being forced for me to pass through the soldiers who filled the * * before the door of the room in which the commissioners held their * it was thrown open my name announced and the commissioners advanced to receive me with * * i bowed to them saying gentlemen * your * for they were still standing i * the * of your positions it was a mistake in your government to have selected gentlemen for this mission you have however shown me but * courtesy in having kept me waiting your pleasure for nearly an hour in the cold they * * their * of my arrival c some few * * followed and i now took a * of the scene a large table was placed in the middle of the room at the upper end of which sat general * and at the other * governor * mr * private secretary of mr seward as secretary of the commission sat at a small table a little to the left of general * and two other persons at a similar table to the rear of governor * my own seat was * between the commissioners in full view of the whole party large * of papers lay before general * which he * * and seemed * what to do governor * made some * remark to which i replied i suppose this is a * court and i can answer or not according to my own * one of the * now said if you please to speak * madam i rose from my seat and said to general * if it is your object to make a spectacle of me and furnish reports for the newspapers i shall have the honour to withdraw from this presence * both of the commissioners arose and * that they had no such intention but that it was necessary to take notes in order to lay before the president and congress i then resumed my seat and governor * continued in a * in no * different from that of an ordinary conversation held in a drawingroom and to which i replied * or * as * my purpose and a * * would have * that the * was * with * * to defend the government rather than * me finally and after it had continued some time i said but when is this dreadful * this trial for * which has been * to the world with so much * to * for i can scarcely believe that i have been brought from my prison on this * day for the purpose of this very * and * conversation or be induced to regard it in the light of a * trial for life liberty and estate * of blood and all the other * of * times at this the * laughed * governor * * attempted to speak several times and changed his mind and finally said general * you are so much better * with mrs * suppose you continue the examination i * said * it for i hold that it has not begun general * turned over and over again the papers before him which were my letters seized by the * * and which though * to the * had no * importance or bearing at this time he selected one * his hand upon it but still * i watched him * at last he said you are charged with * i deny it sir during the eight months of my * i have had * time to study the constitution of the united states and there is no act or provision in it which will * a charge of that nature against me and so you deny the charge of * i do sir most * and * * the charge against yourself as being the minister of a president who has * the constitution destroyed the personal rights of the citizen and * revolution at this moment sir you are * at and * a trial * in every sense and without even a presence of the * form * for the constitution of the united states is very * and * as to the * in which a trial for * shall be conducted it * that the charge for * shall be * by two * * which you could not find in all * he then held up the letter which he had selected i immediately * it as the one i had caused to be * in baltimore and to which i have before * i held out my hand saying let me see it after a moment of * he gave it to me i glanced my eye over its contents and returned it to him saying it is rather a clever letter is it not general * replied mrs * * no new * in * of her ability in the use of her pen i bowed my head and said well general what next have you to say you are charged madam with having caused a letter which you wrote to the secretary of state to be published in richmond that can scarcely be brought forward as one of the causes for my arrest as i was some three months a prisoner when that letter was written and i myself regarded its * * * to its * at richmond as a grave cause of * against the secretary of state you are charged madam with holding communication with the enemy in the south if this were an established fact you could not be surprised at it i am a southern woman and i thank god that no drop of yankee blood ever * my * and as all that i have ever * or * have been driven by * * to seek * there it would seem the most natural thing in life that i should have done so how is it madam that you have * to * in spite of the * * over you that is my secret sir and if it be any satisfaction to you to know it i shall in the next * hours make a report to my government at richmond of this rather * trial for * general * madam charges you with having obtained a * knowledge of his plans and of * him consequently four times to change them at this i * * my shoulders without reply saying well what else after a few moments general * said governor i think we have nothing else to say to * to which governor * replied no sir i think not of course i do not * to * the entire conversation for it could not be called an examination but have * the most important points i now said it seems to me a little extraordinary that after such grave charges as that of * cabinet * and * and * the plans of commanding generals no curiosity should have been felt to * at the * of my * * if only as a measure of * for the future as it is but * to suppose i must have had able * high in the national * and that this information must have sought me at my own house as it can be clearly established that i have never crossed the * of a * oh that * me resumed general * did lieutenant * ever take out * for you oh certainly by authority of the * but if you wish to * lieutenant * you had better send for him and question him on that subject as i certainly should not * him or * else who might have rendered me a service general * asked where is lieutenant * mr * replied with his regiment in virginia general * then said i shall be very glad to serve you madam and shall certainly * the government to allow you to go south or * your wishes in any other * that he * deeply my extreme bitterness for which he could see no reason c i replied that is the difference between * and * i have been now eight months a prisoner subject during that period to every * and * which * * could * my property * and destroyed shut up in close * and actually suffering the * of * to this * has my child of eight years been also exposed thereby seriously * her health not * with this i have been daily * in the * of the administration and sought to be dragged down to the * of the * of your white house knowing me then as you do it will not seem strange that instead of * this system should have excited my * * and * * on * this evidence you can but smile at the * of the charges and the extreme care not to * any information from me i have however sir to return my most * thanks to you and your * for the * and kind feeling which has * your bearing towards me and to * you upon the conclusion of a task which can be but little in * with the feelings of gentlemen * both commissioners advanced and shook hands and expressed an earnest hope that i would very soon be sent south march # this evening mr wood came to my room to * that the * who took down the examination was below and requested to see me i * him to bring him up he came to ask my permission to furnish a report of the * to the newspapers saying that a new york and a philadelphia paper had each offered him five hundred dollars for it and as the curiosity was very great to see it it would be impossible to prevent * of some sort from getting out i told him that i had no * for anything i had said to be known my only desire being to avoid * * besides * reports very rarely did justice c he replied on the contrary madam yours is * to make a great impression it has been read before the commissioners and official authorities and the highest * * upon it he opened his papers and read some * of it which read * enough and were certainly sufficiently * so i withdrew my * as to its * that same night this person received a * order from secretary seward under * of * and heavy fine not to furnish any article on the subject for the press * * however came out in all of the papers that the * mrs * had made a full * of her * c on 30th march i received a letter from mrs s a * in which she said i do believe you have a stern joy in your * else you would * the opportunity to escape from it the

upon me he told me that general * informed him that the order for my * had been given by * who * to my * on the grounds that i knew his plans better than lincoln c c and that he did not wish me sent

than i can * and i now also began to * the fact that my physical health was being gradually * by want of exercise and want of proper food a feeling of * was * over me and a nervous * which prevented

rule of privilege so that it was necessary to make constant * to the officer on duty one day on going down the guard very * placed his * before me and said you shall not go down that way and ordered me to go by a * back * which was not the usual route i immediately sent for the officer of the guard lieutenant * who passed me down some time after the woman * and the one calling herself mrs * or * attempted to go down and were also stopped by the guard with whom they entered into an * contest and resolved in * to force their way through them * was pushed into a corner and held there by a *

down and * her attracted by the * i went up under escort of lieutenant * when this statement was given to me and to the officer by the women * * and * the guard also who witnessed it giving * the same account thus it will be seen that i must have suffered much from this * association captain * came up to speak with me on the subject greatly * at the * and said that he would * the guard if he could have any * in doing so i told him that i thought it was a case which he could not take * of as he could only regard it as a fight between a prisoner and a guard in which the prisoner was the * captain

fall into * * in my arms finally i resolved to make another appeal in behalf of my family physician being permitted to visit her and wrote to general * on the subject * her condition c general * upon the * of my note and the * by the * of the * condition of the child gave orders that dr * who was himself under * should have a special order to visit me dr * upon visiting me found the condition of the child critical and represented to the general the necessity of her having more * food also air and exercise and * she was taken out very generally for a short time each day by one or other of the officers captain * lieutenant * and lieutenant * were each very kind to rose they seemed to be ashamed of the * which could go so far as to * the life of a little child of eight years several federal

but out of reach of * with the * even i frequently sent out letters for him but as he was in solitary * it was very difficult and required the * of several persons the * was this when * went down in

* with the very air rank and * with the * from their * bodies where they lay as a warning * to * for all future time this is a * * for * * than mine my intention is in the * chapter to touch upon the causes which have effected the * of the federal compact between north and south as an * of the evil * which * from * in this my * chapter i shall touch upon a subject which * does not come within my * and i approach it with a * * with its importance it is not my purpose to * the causes which have brought about the * of the american * i do not * to the character of a * or that of a * * but as an * and i trust * * i think i can correct some grave * of the events which have gained * in the first place slavery although the occasion was not the * cause of the * the * which bound the * together was * beyond its strength and of course * at the point where the * of the * was greatest the contest on the part of the north was for supreme control especially in * to the * action of the government this object could not be fully * by a mere * majority a majority of states was also necessary to secure this majority and thus complete the political * the north the policy of no more slave states was * set forth a political party was formed whose sole principle was the * of slavery from the * there was no moral sentiment * in this it did not * the * of slavery it made not a human being free nor did it * to do so sir said mr * in the senate this is not a moral question it is a question of political power lord russell has more recently * this bold assertion by saying that this was a struggle on one side for * and on the other for independence on the other hand the southern states * for * and * to maintain the * of the government insisted upon the rights of their citizens to enter and live in the new * upon terms of * with the men north of * and * line they * for the right of extending their social * not to * slavery not to make a single human being a slave that would otherwise be free but simply to preserve the * of power between the two * it is true that the * * was brought to bear and it is also true that there followed a * * which divided * * * political parties * and * the * of society and * congress for the * of its constitutional duties and resulted in the * of the southern people from their northern connection but this * was not an active or * * and * itself rather in the want of any general anxiety to * the movement for * equally * is the * that the secession of the south * in the * of a defeated party and * to the successful * the personal character of mr lincoln and his political opinions except so far as they represented that armed * which * the * of the southern states and was * for their * and * had not formed with the southern people the subject of either interest or * they knew that there were in the constitution important * which would furnish them with * means of * themselves against the * purposes of the existing * and even of * such * of the * law as might during his term of service be beyond their control the stern * of the southern people free from all party * and * indicated a * knowledge of the extent and * of the * * upon them and subsequent events have proved that they had both wisdom and * * to * the proper * and firmly to * it they regarded it as the first step towards the * of american * liberty even * the northern theory of government to be true * that the union was one * * it is * that the * authority * its powers and draw its force from all the parts of the entire nation so that by their * independence they can * the * of any one part to * the sovereignty of the whole when the north assumed the government over the south as its own * possession it sought to * an * * for liberty true civil liberty cannot * where rights are on one side of a * line and the power on the other the southern people are * * * in their * and opposed even to a fault to * but where the * was presented of an * of their political liberty or a change in their federal relations they did not * to prove that they were fully * i will * the * of * * a northern * never charged with southern or * * after * with great * against a course so * he * these are serious but * questions and in order to appreciate them fully it is only necessary to turn the * upon ourselves suppose that the south having a majority of the * * should * that they would only have * for presidents and should * such by their * * to rule over us at the north do you think that we would * to it * of no never no not for a moment and do you believe that our southern * are less * upon this subject than you or less * of their rights if you do let me tell you that you are mistaken and therefore you must see that if this sectional party * it * * to the destruction of this beautiful * * by our * * by their blood and * to us as a * blessing i call * attention to the following views not only on account of their * value but from the * which * to the author as the interested * of the lincoln government i doubt if the * of revolution furnish a more * instance of political * but i will appeal from * * to * * the following is a portion of the letter by the * r j * * an appeal for the union * forth the * of the * of the abolition party and the * certain to * their * of the control of the government as my object is to give a simple record of events i do not * to attempt the * of the institution which has been the * * of * and * * the * of southern independence the english * who * this subject seem to * themselves to the consideration of the * principle of slavery and entirely * the facts and circumstances of the case few * of government or society could stand such a * if the question were simply whether it would not be better for the south to have four * of * * and * * in the place of four * of * slaves it would be neither so delicate nor difficult of * but the question which * the * * and * of the southern people is of a far * character it is this two * one * the other * being * * what does the good of society require the freedom or * of the * race the south believe that the freedom of the * under such circumstances would result certainly in their final * and that * is best * to their * and moral condition the * of race is as fixed and * as any other law of nature and has been * in the history of the world wherever the * * have come in conflict the north american indians were a race of * with far higher * * than the negro and not * that * * against * which * against the negro but at the same time there being no * of interest in the

the * of * in * of this law of race i can * an example which comes within my own immediate knowledge and which is * by the * and * which * to the negro question in * there are between sixty and * thousand * being about * of the whole * they are a * * and most useful people yet they cannot be * cannot bear witness in court cannot * with the white race or exercise a single right of * except pay * the wisdom of the policy of the south in regard to this * responsibility is * * by the very * which the institution of slavery now * to the world for thirty years its enemies have * * it by every * of mind and heart the * the press * * secret * armed * have all been employed to * * and * in the southern states their * have * the * * of the american government from * to * they have caused the

the race as we found it was * of any such institution or even the knowledge of it nevertheless it is true that our laws are * * with the * of not having secured to them this blessing of * but what the
