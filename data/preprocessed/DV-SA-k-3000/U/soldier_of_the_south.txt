violent storm was * * the * ground as i wrote you last followed the next day by one of fire and blood the battle of seven pines i pray my * that you accepted the invitation of your mountain * and that your beautiful eyes and tender heart have been spared the horrors of war which this battle must have poured into sad richmond three hundred and fifty of your soldiers brigade # strong were killed or wounded and all fought as * should fighting as they did for the right for love honor home and state principles which they had been taught from the mothers knees the * and the * under orders from old * we marched at daylight and reported to d h hill near seven pines hill directed me to ride over and * with hood i started at once with * and * of my staff to obey this order but had gone only a short distance when we met a part of the louisiana * in * i * to seize and * one fellow mounted on a * that seemed to have * his * fear and haste the man dropped his * and * his * threatened to kill me unless i * him at once saying that the yankees were upon his * we * back to hills headquarters * bringing up the rear with the * who explained that the enemy were advancing in force and were within a few hundred yards of us hill ordered me to attack at once which i did driving them through an * over a * leading to the railroad as we were * the second * i on foot at the time noticed that * brigade had broken and sent a * back * to hill for troops a second and third message were sent and then a fourth telling him that if he would send me more troops and ammunition we could drive the enemy across the chickahominy but alas hill as brave as great as heroic a soldier as he is has since the fall of johnston been so * and * with * orders that he was if i may say so * * after this delay nothing was left for us but to withdraw hill sent two regiments of * brigade and ordered * brigade on my right and at one oclock at night under his orders we withdrew in perfect form while the enemy retreated to their * cover thus my darling was ended the battle of seven pines no shot was fired afterward oh how i wish i could say it ended all battles and that the last shot that will ever be heard was fired on june first 1862 what a change love does make how tender all things become to a heart touched by * beautiful the beautiful is and how * is evil see my darling see what power you have guard it well i

used to feel in that way i always as sure as fate received from her a letter written at the very time that i had the * of her presence i wonder if up there she is watching over me trying to send me some message some warning i wish i knew this morning my brigade moved from its * on the williamsburg road and by * was marching along the * turnpike leading north of richmond the * and character of the expedition is unknown but the position of other troops * a general movement this evening we crossed the chickahominy and are * on our guns in the road in front of * from which point i am blessing my spirit and * my soul by sending a message to my promised wife i am tired and * several times today going to sleep on my horse this war was really never * in earnest i believe if either the north or the south had expected that their * would result in this obstinate struggle the cold * * and the * * * and * would have made a compromise poor old virginia came * than * * with her * * and though she desired to be loyal to the union of states she did not believe in the right of * and when called upon to furnish troops to * her sister states she refused and would not even permit the passage armed force through her * for that purpose with no thought of cost no consideration of * of * strength or conditions she rolled up her * ready to risk all in defense of a principle * by the blood of her fathers and now alas it is too late we must carry through this bitter task * the end may the end be soon your soldier t is only when you are here with me my darling that i am not * * under my * absence from my command as poor a * as the yankee was who shot me i wish he had been * still * as he must have been either at my head or my heart and breaking my wing he was frightened too i * and had

was wounded and has won for it * and from it love and respect old * is a fine fellow a brave splendid soldier he was in the mexican war and was wounded in the battle of mexico he commanded a brigade

you his love he is an old * though and i dont know about sending this message it is rather dangerous no no my * i am not afraid i only wish as i told old * that he had a * just like you he is as * and proud as he is * and sweet * and has felt more * than most men would old * * of him at the battle of * when all his ammunition gave out and he withdrew his brigade from the field for which he was arrested and relieved from duty old * told * that in * garnett he had no reference to his want of daring which was * for old * to say who never * anything * who is one of his generals says old * * himself as the god of war giving short sharp commands distinctly rapidly and * without * or explanation and * * and * being himself absolutely * and having unusual mental and moral as well as physical courage he goes ahead on his own * asking no advice and * * he places no value on human life * for nothing so much as fighting unless it be praying illness * and all * he * as * and * of a * of patriotism suffering from * he often * his men as a * and when he cant sleep calls them up * them out a few miles then * them back he never * his men for * because it is their duty to be gallant and they do not * credit for doing their duty well my own darling i only pray that god may spare him to us to see us through if general lee had grants resources he would soon end the war but old * can do it without resources bless your heart here i am talking of these old * to my * well she knows how entirely i love her and how i have left in her keeping my souls all * and faithfully my * your own soldier here we are my darling at fredericksburg on the south side of the rappahannock half way between richmond and washington * for us by the hand of the great father i * you a note by old * on the 12th from the foot of the hills between * run and the telegraph road in it i sent a * given me by a pretty lady who came out with * * and some * and written * from old * and old * hood ewell stuart and your brothers to the * * i was writing it seems an * my * since the first of november when we moved on from orange court house i sent you a short note last night after the days great battle telling you that even in the midst of it all my heart and thoughts my division nine thousand strong is in fine * it was on the field of battle as a division for the first time yesterday though only one brigade * was * engaged what a day it was my darling you were in this ever to be remembered by many of us * of december * * upon us * in * * mourning a * such as would shame london lay over the valley and through the dense * distinctly came the * commands of the * * officers my men were eager to be in the midst of the fight and if hood had not been so * they would probably have * themselves old * orders were that hood and myself were to hold our ground of defense unless we should see an opportunity to attack the enemy while engaged with a p hill on the right a little after ten when the * had lifted and stuarts cannon from the plain of * were turned upon meade and when * advance left the enemys flank open i went up to hood and urged him to seize the opportunity but he was afraid to * so great a responsibility and sent for permission to old * who was with marse robert in a different part of the field before his * and * were received the opportunity alas was lost if war my own is a necessity and i suppose it is it is a very cruel one your soldiers heart almost stood still as he watched those sons of * * rush to their death the brilliant assault on * we crossed the potomac on the #* at * and went into * on the maryland side from which place i sent my lady love along letter and some flowers gathered on the way we then went on to * where we met a p hills corps which had crossed the river farther down from * i sent to the same and only lady love another letter which was not only * with all the * and devotion of her soldiers heart but contained * from the staff and * to take care of him and bring him safely back to her we made no delay at * but passing through in the rear of hills corps moved on up the * valley and * at * where the most * letter of all yet written was sent to well * whom this time why to the same lady love the * * flower that ever * to bless and make * a beautiful world for it is beautiful * in its * nothing of * or * nothing of this deadly * between men who should be * of a great and common cause as they are the * of a great and common country the officers and men are all in excellent condition bright and cheerful singing songs and telling stories full of hope and courage * with * faith and confidence in our success there is no * no * no * no * and there are no * think of it an army of sixty thousand men marching through the enemys country without the least opposition the object of this great movement is of course unknown to us its purpose and our * are known at present only to the commanding general and his chief * the officers and men generally believe that the intention is entirely to * the army of the potomac and to place washington and baltimore within our grasp they think that marse robert is merely threatening the northern * with the view of suddenly turning down the * * off all railroad * * all bridges throwing his army north of baltimore and * off washington and that beauregard is to follow on directly from richmond * manassas to washington in rear of hooker who of course will be in pursuit of marse robert * * we reached here this morning june #* the * of the battle of * mill where your soldier was wounded we marched straight through the town of * which was more deserted than * village the stores and houses were all closed with here and there * of * * of * * earnestly talking more * shadows than smiles * their faces i had given orders that the * were not to play but as we were marching through the * part of the city some young ladies came out * the * of one of the * homes in the town and asked would you mind * off the * a bit so the command was given and the band played home sweet home * * her bright smile * me still * gray and * * the young ladies asked the next band that passed if they * play * but the band instead struck up the old * * the * river the old arm chair the * rock by the sea and * * * thought you was rebels * you come from * cant play * none of you they called out we marched straight on through the city and are * four miles beyond the town on the york river road tomorrow if * promise not to * it to a human soul ill tell you a great secret no my * i cant wait

five hours following when the men lay in the tall grass in the rear of the artillery line the july sun * its * * almost * down upon them till one oclock when the awful silence of the vast battlefield

before the brow of seminary ridge i closed my letter to you a little before three oclock and rode up to old * for orders i found fire upon him like a great * at bay i have never seen him so grave and troubled for several minutes after i had * him he looked at me without speaking then in an * voice the reserve all gone he said pickett i am being * at the thought of the sacrifice of life which this attack will make i have * alexander to watch the effect of our the enemy and when it * to tell he must take the responsibility and give you your orders for i cant while he was yet speaking a note was brought * from alexander after reading it i handed it to him asking if i should obey and go forward he looked at me for a moment then held out his hand presently * his other hand over mine without speaking he bowed his head upon his breast i shall never forget the look in his face nor the * of his hand when i said then general i shall lead my division on i had * only a few * when i remembered letter and forgive me * * in a corner of the * if old * * means death then * and god bless you little one turned back and asked the dear old chief if he would be good enough to * it for me as he took your letter from me my darling i saw your tears * on his cheeks and * the stern old * god bless him was * for his men and i know praying too that this cup might pass from them i * the silent * of his bowed head an * given against his own * given in * and with * my brave boys were full of hope and * of victory as i led them forth forming them in column of attack and though officers and men alike knew what was before them knew the * against them they eagerly offered up their lives on the altar of duty having * faith in their * success over on cemetery ridge the federals * a scene never before witnessed on this * a scene which has never previously been * and can never take place again an army forming in line of battle in full view under their very eyes * across a space nearly a mile in length over fields of waving * and * of * and then a * * moving with the * of a dress * the pride and glory soon to be crushed by an * * well it is all over now the battle is lost and many of us are prisoners many are dead many wounded * and dying your soldier lives and * and but for you my darling he would rather a * times rather be back there with his dead to sleep for all time in an unknown grave your * soldier on the fourth far from a glorious fourth to us or to any with love for his * wrote you just a line of * the sacrifice of life on that * field on the fatal third was too awful for the * of victory even for our * foe who i think believe as we do that it decided the fate of our cause no words can picture the * of that * the * * between the * the here of those who by gods mercy had * escaped the awful rain of shot and shell was a * * * for the * name of his comrade called before his there was no tone of * for having been spared to answer to their names but rather a * and an * wish that they too had been among the * but for the * to your sweet young life but for you only you my darling your soldier would rather by far be out there too with his brave * dead even now i can hear them cheering as i gave the manassas and * where we had a brilliant skirmish with the enemy for three days and nights i have been almost constantly in the saddle last night the #* i had a tent * and sat down to a * at a camp table the first time since leaving * hill we had been going * * when we did sleep it was with the * for a * and a * * for a pillow we shall be here three or four days

very quiet wedding * only the * and blessing of the church and after that back to my division and to the blessing of those few of them who by gods * were left i gave colonel harrison a gold * piece which i was a parting * to me from the officers of the * and told him to have it made into a wedding ring at * i asked him to have * within g e p and s c married and to leave sufficient space for date

mcclellan reached in his * progress in # over a crimson road both armies have returned to cold harbor the wilderness alas is one vast * where sleep thousands of grants soldiers but grant like our stonewall is fighting not to save lives but country for the second time now cold harbor has become a battle ground two years ago it furnished the field for the battle of * mill which the yankees called cold harbor where your soldier was wounded does it seem to you as long ago as two years my darling to me it seems but yesterday that i lay in richmond at my little sisters and you came to see me blessing and cheering me i can feel now the soft getting a wagon * of things up from * but i am almost afraid to trust one through oh my * i do want to see you so much i have been right sick for a

goodbye sweet one ever your own soldier left my garden of * my darling with many a pause and * glance behind but out in the midst of this terrible conflict to which i have come your love is with me * and blessing me i reached camp just before * george * around and made me a * of * coffee a * no * in it and while i * my coffee he kept off the * which early as it was had begun to be very * * me the while with news of the camp and his own views on * events having finished my breakfast george went out to get breakfast for the * and before they had assembled i had * off my desk and written several letters all made affectionate * for you and our little son though some of them did not know that i had * in last night until i told them i must go now my * and ride around the lines and make my report but will add a few more words later on so a * till then well my darling we have had a most * day marse robert came out he was * and very very silent we had just paid our * to * * when he arrived the * we used in so doing was a new one or rather a very old one * * it was a * battery hidden in the * * to the enemy and easily * from one * place to the other it used to be the only way in which shells could be thrown it * these shells high in the air and they fall by their own weight without the least warning of their coming there is no * or * sound like that made by our modern shells they fall almost as silently as a * * and it seems to me almost * to drop these silent * * down upon those * * negroes for i learn that it is they that are doing the * butler with promise of * pay for * work and * danger has induced four hundred of his colored soldiers to * to * their * and take up the * and go to * the bank to be cut through is only about five feet at the highest point the * is to be where the james makes a great * just above * gap in closing a point is land perhaps half a mile wide and about three miles in length and which at the neck is only five hundred yards across from river to river their * would thus save them six miles and would allow their gunboats to go up the james without running the * of our * guns our * * * * and as our left is all at the turn of the * they would not have to * the open river in search of an exposed water * it is strange that some of our brilliant * * made this near cut years ago as for me i should * butler and his river * company and * throwing these * shells whose silent fall * a sudden roar of * that * terror to my soul the * will be an advantage to us and butler in * it for us may in part * for the many homes he has destroyed mine among them well my own if you were not the best of all good women as well as the most beautiful of all beautiful women and the most patient of all patient women you would weary of so * a soldier who takes away the * of flowers and the glory of love and * back the * of war and its * and the * of a loyal old * who * be sold and * run away and whom i was obliged to permit to be * to me in order to save him the only negro i * come to think of it he * me forever and ever your soldier after an evening spent at the white house of the confederacy you will be glad my darling wife that the * the powers that be was most * after the evening * i called on the ladies at the white house and at the most earnest * and * of mrs davis and her sister miss * * with them poor mr davis looks tired and anxious but he spoke so * of our success that knowing as he must know our * the condition of our army etc i should have thought that he was aware of something * of which we are ignorant if he had not said later when foreign * was being * that he believed that england and in fact all the foreign powers were like the woman who saw her husband fighting a bear she * care a * which was * but shed be the best pleased if both were the dinner my * was beautiful and so * were its * that i * greatly knowing as i do how difficult it is with most of us to get even a little tea or coffee or * as usual mrs davis was * and * she * described her * of a little orphan negro from a great black * who had * himself the boys * she told how she had him * and * and dressed in a suit of little * clothes and how while he was proud of the clothes he was a thousand times * of and more grateful for the * and * which his * * had given him and which upon all occasions he * exhibited as * of honor she said that the little * was greatly troubled when the * were finally * and tried to * them with a dog * which was taken away he was * and * to make over his * with her keen sense of * mrs davis told us how when * that one after another of her * was being * by the yankees with money and * to * the family and come over to part of the the other side she would * * of the intention give them food for imagination * for their * the most impossible * stories some of which she told us she said that * the last one of her * to go was such an excellent maid and so hard to * that as soon as she began to show her * * with * and * and then with gold and notes she had tried without * * * her intention to offer her * to remain but had failed mrs davis said she was so * after * departure and in such * need of mental * * that she went into * with * * a country gentleman in * * * did you ever my darling mr * p * and dr * were the only other guests mr * usually wonderful * mind and * dignity were not in evidence he did rather * express his astonishment that mr davis should be bowed down with grief by the * * of those he was trying to serve and that he should care a * for their * of * and the more * charge of leaving his cotton to be bought by the yankees he ended by saying that he * had to * mr davis of that exceedingly good man christ you know my own * was born at st * in the west * of * * what a * your husband is my * but i promised to write my beautiful * every day everything i said or did or that * else said or did and i have forever and ever your soldier in the dark days before the end his morning at breakfast my darling * when you suggested having an * * for my officers after our conference to night i said that i feared we should not have enough * our old * * has just brought in a fine large wild * and with that and the three * of * which your uncle colonel * sent i think we can get up a fine supper dont you my * of a * i hope you can and hope too that the good cheer it will provide will help us to new and * * for as * as i always am even my heart is in my * on every side gloom * and disappointment seem to have settled over all men and officers alike because of the * * of the peace conference on board the river queen on the fatal third the anxious * faces i see everywhere * heavy hearts our commissioners knew that we were * our last the peace conference was a * hope because of the * of the conference and my know * and that * of mr lincoln his humanity his broad nature his warm heart i did believe he would take advantage of this very * and spring some wise * surprise which would * * peace and in time * * now heaven help us it will be war to the * with the * no longer keen the thrust of the arm no longer strong the * that when peace comes comes it will follow the * of the * your soldier by your by any written in defeat after the battle of five forks t is long past the midnight hour and like a boy i have been reading over your dear * letter * the written page because it has been touched hand all is quiet now but soon all will be * for we march at daylight oh my darling were there ever such men as those of my division this morning after the review i * them for their * services yesterday on the first of april never to be forgotten of us when to my mind they fought one of the most desperate battles of the whole war their answer to me was cheer after cheer one after another calling out thats all right marse george * only followed you then in the midst of these calls * them rose loud and clear dear old * voice singing the old * which they all knew i loved guide me oh * great * * through this * land voice after voice joined in till from all along the forth line the * rang be my sword and * and * be the lord my * my heart i do not think my * the tears * in my voice as it mingled with * but they were in my eyes and there was something new in when the last line had been * i gave the order to march * to this point where i had expected to cross the appomattox and * the main army while we were at a * here orders came from general r h anderson to report to him at * tavern just after * my letter to you at five forks telling you of our long * march of eighteen hours and of the * hours following those where i had because of * circumstances been induced to fall back at daylight i received a * from the great * telling me to hold five forks at all * to prevent the enemy from striking the south side railroad this * was in reply to one i had sent to him * the state of affairs and that the enemy were trying to get in between the army and my command and asking that * be made at once or i should be * i had had all trains * in the rear of * run and much preferred that position but from the * for from the * * which mrs * gave
