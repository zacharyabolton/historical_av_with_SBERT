explained to me that though it was pleasant and * to live in the house of our fathers the absence of that comfort did not * place a person beyond the pale but i felt at that time that it was * charity that caused her to set forth that view for i thought that people who did not live in their own houses could not be * two members of my * household were * as church visitors mrs mary * who was * and whose husband a sea captain had been lost in a * and miss * * who through a * * had lost her sight on the * of her marriage and had in consequence been deserted by her * there were * in those days but no homes for * women and the members of the church took care of their * * as mrs * and miss * belonged to the old * church they were invited as * guests by * some years earlier the * church had become almost * in virginia and the * was still very small so that the visits were * extended as my * home was especially pleasant the guests * their stay * suddenly falling too ill to be moved if there was any suggestion of their going elsewhere mrs * or miss mary as we called her could not hear but she read the movements of the lips a * of which miss * would * take advantage by turning away as she spoke * her friend would thus * her turn your head this way * * you dont want me to hear what you are talking about * me a little news and i interested in everything and the lord knows i * a bit of curiosity how do you know what the lord knows mary * if you knew half what he knows you * make so many * no curiosity indeed * * full of it * bore a * * through the earth to see what was on the other side you * know what was on the other side if there was a * through and somebody * it with a * and * so * you * tell me if you did know not that it makes any difference * not * to known anything on any side of the earth * was the * * if i dont know things why should you be so anxious to see me talk so you could find them out miss mary was saved from the * of a reply by the * arrival of my grandmother who could always * * to the waters when they were especially troubled a part of my youthful education consisted of the * stories * to me by the * faithful * whose memory * the * of moving * by land and sea told her in early days by the * thus i met the * of the south * * at the * * that * the persons and * of the * of * * the * in the * waves of the river that * below the edge of my * lawn and heard many a story of storm and * in which the * * had performed * of skill and * well mary * exclaimed miss * in stern * when i would be lost in * attention to these * * what do you mean by putting such * into that innocent childs head what do you suppose she will come to when she * up a * * come out of one yourself most * or you * get such * ideas just fancy people wearing other * heads and hanging them on the wall when they can * up beautiful shell * right off their own * and can get * flowers to put around their houses that look natural and wont ever * and as for * you know there never were any now * * mrs * would answer the bible tells us that there are more things in heaven and earth than * ever * of and we know its true and if * cant even dream of the things in heaven and earth how in the name of common sense are you going to know * in the waters under the earth and * it stand to reason that those who go down into the great deep know more about * in the * than you do who would be afraid of the wave of a * on a * in * moments mrs * would tell me of the * * * * that lie in wait to * * * to destruction on the * from which danger her * had been delivered by the memory of her unfortunately miss * * to be present at one of these * * you never did have green hair mary * not even at your * and that * be much and as for * eyes you * * a * not if your dinner * on it and if you ever did sing it must have been worse than a * of * talk about that old * who moved trees when he played i should think your singing would be enough to make all the * in virginia run away the more you * that child mary * the less she knows the lord gave her more * to begin with than shell ever get from you and if you go on telling her such * shell forget all she ever did know i heard you yesterday telling her about the * of the children of * that keep on crossing the red sea now i want you to know mary * that when those * crossed the red sea once they were on the other side for good and they dont go on walking through that water as if the lord had nothing to do but take care of them every time they * to go * there is such a thing as * the lord once too often and the * that know him as well as the children of * did * going to take * like that on him first thing you know * have that child seeing * and you know well enough that people who see * * ever * to see anything thats worth looking at i was often troubled in my mind between a confidence in miss mary which i wished to preserve * and the force of miss * * the * of * * in my * mind was * by the story of miss * lost vision which ran thus she was visiting at the home of a friend who * a * of unusual * of mind and independence of character its mistress had a little * * like those you may recall having seen * * * out and use for the * of music somewhat * in tone but well * to please the taste of the * * the lady would * to the bird which would answer her in tones that * fell short of its ambition the mistress had a * like her own made for the * who * to * * a high degree of skill in its use and was proud of the * once when miss * * called she wished to * him with a * of the birds * putting her friends * to her lips she approached the * the * apparently * with the * for daring to * the character of its mistress * its * through the * and * out one of the * eyes from * or sympathy the other eye lost its sight the * affection failed before the * of a blind * and he found a more fortunate lady this story was told me as a * in * from * with the * of other people in * with * * in my school reader it led me to extreme care in * too great * with things that did not belong to me i was * not only by the tragic story but by the * of miss * teeth falling out of place as she told it to me she had * them by the sacrifice of her * of gold dollars the * of friends through many years the * and * of this * furnished another subject of * with miss mary who was a * soul and * as well * * she said if the lord had intended you to have teeth all your life * he have given you a set that would have * to your dying day miss * * with spirit if he wanted me to go without teeth because the ones he made turned out * why do you suppose he put people into the world that were * enough to make new ones just answer me that the question being * * the conversation * i found relief from the * produced by the tragic * * to me by going out into the * on the * lawn and walking under the pink and white * of the * * * or rose of * as the * * was sometimes called the negroes had named the * the * tree because they broke * from it and * the * of the * * into * * than the * hair * and used them for * their teeth miss rose * she first started it they said she was a * and lived in the tree and the pink and white * are the smile of her pretty face i thought the * * in the * tree was what kept the teeth of the negroes so * white and we children always made our * of the same material hoping to * a like result on the plantation were some story trees or * trees as the negroes called them on their * were * of white and gray * like * of thin * each of the * bore a warning or a * brought by the spirits and written there the trees were * old and held the ancient bible stories * before the * was * when the art of reading was among the * things and not even the * * had been * it was only the most important * that the lord would permit to be * to the old trees some of the spirit records had broken lines and the servants said that the * wing was broken as he brought the message down there was a deep and * * on one of the * trees which indicated a tragedy past or to come and i used to gaze upon it with * wonder trying to read its dread meaning a few years later a great tragedy came and the * of it * our whole nation but whether that was what the old tree * meant i know not * has a point of * period back of which life to present consciousness was not for me this point stands out * in memory i was * with my grandmother for since she took me home in the * she had * asserted her claim my time was divided between the two homes hers and my fathers my tall handsome father and my beautiful little mother sat on the front * my brother thomas playing near them on the grass it was in * time and i saw uncle charles coming up the slope carrying a * * on which hung a great * of * * * with bright red ones that he had gathered for them to take home suddenly my attention was * from the * to a horse * down the * and * at the gate where a * boy * off he had * * with * for a * as if the horse had been hastily taken from the field come quick as you can please * cried the boy mrs * is dying the * was drawn to the door by old * my grandmother took her seat within and i watched * driving off following them with my eyes to the end of the * where they were lost to view in the * poor mrs * left four children to be * among the members of her church little * falling to my * care the next morning my old mammy broke this news to me * with well i * its all right but de * * dont * to de * en how de * come to * in de * * is * me my * idea of the * church * from the days when its members were noted for * in dress and to her it was always de * * the * of * * did not * her determination to do her duty by the little girl who in her opinion was so * that she was * to an early death in her desire to * her * mammy * me to * * a * to her as you cant * * a * * * sister she expressed her opinion that it was not for nothing that she had been * about * and about * building their * in the * and made gloomy * of * and spirits that would * around and * through the * because of this unfortunate child * by my * eyes that she was * on * ground she stopped short saying * * and play * * new french * set i done talk to myself * i got a * in my * the privilege of playing with my dear little set of * * was granted only when i had been particularly good or some one else particularly * that evening little * * came she was a * * * child with * hair pale blue eyes and * on her fingers i took possession of her * to give her everything i had happy in my * having a tender feeling for her because of her * of the * possessed by the other children i knew and because there * over me * assertion * * to die * one morning aunt * came in to make known to my grandmother her * that the little girl had * * * the warning so you * me * * you better stop she and * * * * one * the * * correct my grandmother stopped our * by taking me to old point comfort to visit her friend mrs * a sister of mr john * * at first i was troubled about my only girl * white girl i mean for mary * and * my little colored * sisters had been my * and * all my life and i was * attached to them like a * * laws and giving them their parts to play in the * of * only a southern child can understand these relations and the * born of them the * of old point soon * my grief and i was happy being a favorite not only with the children but with the older guests who found me useful in * the little ones to whom i taught the fancy steps i had learned from my * and the original songs and * of the negroes on the plantation alas in due course of time i * * * and was thrust into the * of social * instead of the accustomed * welcome i was greeted with run away little girl my little children cannot play with you now i was a * child and this sudden change was like a january * in * but i soon discovered that my * advice * you * be happy * be happy as you * be * followed * * in the long run she pointed out the advantage of being * with myself in that i should have no * from others but * me to be careful not to play too long at one game or i would surely have one of * * * * * * calls on * ear the latter * being * * of * before i had reached this * fate brought me a companion who more than filled the * left by the * of my former * i had seen a solitary officer on the * reading or looking at the * as they came and went or watching the waves as they dashed to sudden death against the shore he * in my imagination as the good prince in the * stories my grandmother told me he did not look as tall as the men of my family but he carried himself so * and walked with such * dignity that i was sure that any good prince might have * him his stately appearance i noted that his hair which hung in shining waves almost to his shoulders was the same color as my own and i * one of my * around to look at it and make sure of the * of the comparison even at that early age i had a * for * hands and feet and i noticed his small feet as he * the * and the delicate hand that was raised to his cap in * to an officer who passed the grace of his hands was well set off by the * * that * his * my childish eyes took in the * and perfect fit of his * which set off his distinguished form i thought him quite the * soldier i had ever seen and was surprised one day to hear somebody say that he had fought in the mexican war it seemed impossible to me how could * so * and so beautiful to look upon have really fought and killed people i had never been near enough to see his eyes but * that they must be brilliant stars like those to which i said * just before i * down to * sweet dreams my attention would probably not have been drawn so particularly to my soldier for i had already begun to call him my soldier had he been surrounded by * * companions and formed a part of the gay life of old point comfort i should have observed him only as a brilliant * of the cruel world that had chosen to * me to * but in his solitude i felt that we were comrades in sad experience i knew of only one * that could so set apart a human being from his fellow * as to bar him from association with his kind the * were * and i at once recognized the melancholy officer as a * of * * and gave him the tender pity of one who knew all about his misfortune one morning i was * along * as usual * about the little girl whose * * had been * out by a * asking if the * really did carry * to the devil and other * * to my stage of * when my grandmother stopped to speak to a friend i * on until i came to a * * under which my soldier lay on the * reading he was so absorbed in his book that he did not see me till i * under the * and looked into his face with i suppose all the sympathy that i felt and asked him * if he had the * * telling him of my * * * for that * and * him of her * to * it to his case then he looked at me * raising his cap and smiling and i saw that his eyes were gray shot with * * * blue with * as he gave me a * good morning this recalled me to a * of the * of good society and i got up and * * him good morning and * concerning his health he arose and with * grace returned my * * to a seat for me on the * and resumed his own place returning to the * with which i had opened the interview he asked why i had taken him for a victim of so * an * i * * my own experience and * upon the * * of one so * and said that as he did not * with other officers nor dance with young ladies and had to * and read all by himself as i did i thought it must be because he was suffering from the same misfortune as that which had * me of social * he looked at me with a * of * in his face and then i saw that his eyes could be very dark like the sky sometimes at night when the moon had gone to bed and the stars were only little * * of light in the darkness * * soft he told me that he did not have the * * but he had something worse a broken heart and he did not like to make others sad with his sorrow i had never seen a broken heart but had some acquaintance with articles that had come to grief in the * and had been restored to * * by clever * i * him with the assurance that broken hearts did not * anything of importance my mammy could * them with * and * them in milk so you * even see the * in them as she had done with my * * * how did you break your heart i * * he replied that god broke it when he took from him his loved ones and left him so lonely in return for his confidence i promised to comfort him for his losses and to be his little girl now and his wife just as soon as i was grown up to be a lady he took a ring from his * and put it on my finger and gave me a * gold heart * with * which had been the name of one of his loved ones and i crept out from under the * * to lieutenant george e pickett of the united states army then and to the end he was my soldier and always when we were alone i called him soldier i still have the ring and heart and am * for this * to the little red * book which he gave me years after when he was general george e pickett of the confederate army come again little * he said as i was leaving him to the * * of his book just then my grandmother came up with * for my * upon a stranger and the explanation that my nurse had been sent to the fort with a note for lieutenant pickett the son of one of her old friends asking the pleasure of his company to dinner

country on the * and our stately * brought back to us rich * from all the * of the world we built forts and * them with men as brave as those who fell with * in the great battle of which my soldier told me as we worked upon the * he placed a flag that * * to the * as the waves dashed up to our * * and rolled back defeated it was my first introduction to the * * and the red and white * and * sky impressed me as very beautiful in those days the stars and * were rarely seen in the southern states and the flag of virginia was the only * of sovereignty that i had known my soldier told me the story of the * flag and the * that * upon it amid the smoke of the conflict the thunder of guns and the * of * when i was * with the * incident to our * * operations and the * and * of battle we sat upon the * and he sang to me playing the * on his * when i hear those old songs today they come to me with the far faint * of the * that swept across the ocean in that long gone time and i hear again the golden notes of that * voice mingled with the soft music * out from the touch of his fingers three years later i saw my soldier again he had just received his commission as captain and was * his company at * * before * for the unknown west the first real sorrow came to me when i watched the st * the united states * go out to sea with my soldier on board from her * floated a flag like that which had waved over the fort we built on the * in that time when life had lost all its * and the sunshine of the heart filled earth and sea and sky with * i felt then as i had not before realized that this was my soldiers flag to which his life was given and to my view the stars in it shone with a new glory the st * was bound for * sound where was the new station fort * which i thought must be farther than the end of the world not one ship of our whole great * in the * days had * for * sound when we went home uncle charles came to the * to meet us he was dressed in the clothes left to him

commanding air not * upon his military dress he stopped and spoke to my father who arose greeted him cordially and turning back the seat invited him to join us he accepted and my father introduced colonel robert e lee the colonel shook hands with me in a gentle way and began to * for one of my long * in my * i did not close with any of his * though i would have given every * on my head for the

a subject of horrible * and i listened * as colonel lee talked of this strange old * and his * what do you think would be the effect upon the negro mr * colonel lee asked my father if we should be

while then * his head slowly said i knows marse * dat * marse john done en * de law * all * * but * marse * even * * marse john did * de law dont you think * dat * him would be a * * colonel lee laughed and replied i think that just about * the sentiment not only of the colored people but of many others they agreed that john brown was an honest earnest * old man and that his friends ought to put him where he would be * for my eyes were turned steadily toward colonel lee with a large measure of that admiration he won from * older and more * than i yet i could not have told what manner of

* that the virginia * with all his knowledge of history and character nor the great soldier with his military * recognized * of the * storm any more than did the * child lost in * * over the * * at the next station the colonel left us and i went on into the hill country i was a * at lynchburg seminary when the storm that had begun to lower at harpers ferry broke in full force to a few * minds i think it brought no * of surprise some had watched the little cloud on the * till it had * the * but most of us old as well as young had felt secure in the land where we lay * virginia held * by the

with * * to the * idea that had kept the states together through many severe * of * * in the * of the revolution the * that bound her to the union of states had grown stronger with the years and with the blood of many battles the mother of presidents and of * * her devotion to the * of the nation was of unusual * and * * sought to * her allegiance from the flag whose stars * the path of her great sons washington jefferson madison and the many who had * represented her in the work of building up the nation but the people stood firmly by their * and * faith there was but one thing that could

rang out the * of the rising of the new star in the southern flag were * of victory to many they * the * of a long proud * but the new * floated * to the * * rang out * and all was * to the vision of hope the * of patriotism burned * in the heart of youth and there were stars and bars enough in lynchburg seminary to light a world of * nations to victory and set up * * to the * some weeks later when the news of the battle of manassas came * along the line we felt that events had * our enthusiasm in imagination we * our flag * over a great new country that should * the nations of the world in beauty and glory we saw then only the * of joy and heard only the * of victory but a few days later when my friend major john w * was brought to his home in lynchburg with a wound received in that battle which we had celebrated with such * delight i began to feel that war meant something more than the * of * music and the * of victory major * had been my friend from childhood strong handsome and gallant and when i saw him in suffering * i felt for the first time something of the power of war to strike down life with all its hopes and dreams and * he was soon able to return to the field doing brave service for the cause until he was so * wounded in the battle of the wilderness that he was forced to retire even more * does virginia * the * work he has since done in the united states senate and * does she hold him in her heart now that his brave and beautiful life has passed into the great * hall of her * history through all the years he has been a loyal friend to me and mine the passing of the * of secession was the signal for the return of the * sons of virginia every federal post gave them up to us from arlington where colonel robert e lee laid down his allegiance to the old flag to the * where my soldier had * the * of his country against * indians and foreign * in july 1861 captain pickett resigned from the united states army made a * journey from * * passing by sea around to new york going thence to * and then * * * arrest three times from the window of a * car along a kentucky road is seen an old home where he spent a night in his long journey government officers called there in search of him but he was * by a * of his host and rode on the next morning reaching richmond september # 1861 he at once * as a private being immediately afterward * as captain and a few days later * to a * his military life from richmond to appomattox * to the history of the nation by this time * life in virginia had become * with difficulties even for those who might have been regarded as outside the * of war not only the soldiers in the field had * to * they * in the * of the * my home being within the federal lines i spent a part of my * with friends in richmond there i used to see general robert e lee riding along the street in the graceful way that years before had brought people to their windows to see the * man in the united states army ride down pennsylvania avenue in washington the eyes of richmond followed him with equal admiration in these war days and i used to recall my first meeting with him when the war was a dim * in a short time he was sent away to western virginia where he fought a * but losing battle against mountains rain * and southern * who were * with a military genius never known to the leaders of armies i see that we have made a great mistake the general * we ought to have put the * in the field and set the generals to * the newspapers the streets of richmond knew him no more until he returned in the late autumn with no new * on his brow but with a strength of soul that could * the appointed time in our study * we had * that we knew something of war we had * our flag trembled for our soldiers at the front even while we * * in their future triumph and celebrated with great enthusiasm the battle of manassas we had made * for our country every girl of us having * her * to the * of the school to be sold for the benefit of our cause she had accepted the trust saying that we might * our * if we wished only one piece was ever * a ring given to one of the girls by her * when he was killed in battle she took back the ring * in money for her * now i was to learn something of what war meant on a morning that was like * may the #* of march 1862 i sat on my horse by the river bank at * opposite * news my uncle colonel j j * was stationed there and i had come to the camp and was one of the * gathered on the bank of the * river at that point all eyes turned with eager interest toward hampton roads where lay our new * the virginia like a * she had * from the * of the old * * grim solemn * * low upon the water she was not boat nor * nor * nor anything else * known to the waves * * in her * of iron she was a * * a * hope a theory an armed * a * battery * by * an * destined to change the course of * * being the first ship built in the old * she was named for her state virginia commanded by captain * and * by a * composed * of * who had * from the army she had waited in hampton roads for the * of her day through my * i watched the virginia * like a great white bird * between the * * blue of the * above and the waters beneath accompanied by the gunboats * and * she passed along amid the cheers of the * * * both banks and of the troops at the batteries around the harbor an * feeling took possession of me holding me silent until the enthusiasm of the crowd * me and i waved my * in * of * to the brave new * slowly she * * island lying like a * cloud over the water her batteries turned toward the norfolk shore the troops waved their * and sent up * cheers for the strange * that looked as some one afterward said like a huge * with a large round * about the middle of its back having passed the island she turned into the south * and slowly moved on toward * news until coming within firing range of the united states * congress and * she was greeted with * from both a * of fire pale against the white day a * of smoke * * * around the mouth of the gun and * off into space a deep roar of thunder showed us that our virginia was bearing well her brave old name the enthusiasm which had greeted her appearance was as nothing * with the excitement that * us now * of * and * * the air * * * were thrown * some of the men * others turned * of enthusiasm one soldier rushed to colonel * * say colonel say cant we do something cant we help for gods sake let us do something to help them fortunately there was no bridge from the shore to the scene of action otherwise every man woman and child among that * crowd might have rushed into the fight to the * of the * little virginia we could do our part only by going into * of patriotism in which we all * the virginia went on up the * turned and coming back ran full against the * * her side with the sharp * of the confederate * the * * * and began slowly to * her guns * from her * the congress came to her assistance but the * which * from the two * fell * from the * sides of the virginia with * eyes i watched the * * upon the waves gradually * firing another * as her bow went down then * under the water the flag that floated from her * still * above the sea for days we had seen that * with her * the congress threatening us a * upon our waters a * a thing of evil waiting for the moment of fate but it was * to watch her go down and i think every heart there felt a pride in that * waving * above the water even while we * our * virginia she went on turned and came back to attack the congress which in trying to escape ran * she was soon * * of flame * out from her * in an hour her flag fell we were told afterward that in one of the * which we could * * in the distance an old man waited for the battle and for * of his son commander of the congress when they told him that the flag was down he said sadly then joe is dead he knew by that signal that his son joe captain joseph b smith had fallen the * and * drew up beside the * congress under a heavy fire from the federal batteries on the * news shore which not only did execution upon the * of the confederate gunboats but proved fatal to some of the prisoners from the burning * the * * * toward the congress and was struck by a * from the federal battery beyond the congress the * lay * before the surrender of the congress the * henry thomas jefferson and *

the virginia and her * little * retired slowly moving to * point we returned to our homes * by the * of the scene * for the lost lives but * in the victory won by our brave little * those who watched

expected the new * down in our waters but our imagination had not wound itself around anything so * looking and we did not recognize her until she revealed herself i was early at my post eager to see the end of the * my uncle had his boat ready to put out to the scene of action oh uncle may i go i cried running after him no no he * go back he stepped into the boat and * off without looking behind and did not see that i followed and took a seat in the boat with * and * prepared to take battle views at first hand perhaps an * of today might regard my * with some degree of * * as it was of wall paper turned plain side out cut into leaves of * * and bound together the * of my * grandmother it was the best the confederacy could afford just then and perhaps it served the purpose as well as a

of laughter rang over the water we were too far out to admit of turning back to put me * and there was nothing he could do but endure my company you * think i am going to try to keep you out of danger you * * little * he said * it would serve you right if you were shot i was not thinking of danger it was my first chance at a * and i was not going to miss it thus i watched the first battle of * * apparently * the fact that they had in a moment become useless * the * * * drew aside and observed the * contest the two little * were almost touching and * after * poured into each other my uncle was

will lose your * and fall * though i * it would be a good thing if you did teach you better than to put yourself where you have no business his sense of * as usual saved the situation and he laughed again i think there was never a time since i * him out at midnight to take a * ride in a * that i was not an * as well as a * * to my unfortunate uncle he * shared his glass with * little me and i watched the contest the storm that * upon the virginia was of * shot and shell while it had been impossible to provide the confederate * with anything but shell the * of the * was * than that of her * but the * of the sides of the virginia * the shot to glance * * that advantage the virginia suddenly ran * and the * was quick to * herself of the * but before we were certain of the * of our * she

afterward learned that her commander lieutenant * was * the * was helpless and as the virginia turned toward her we expected that she would be * but probably to the delight of those on board the * as well as to the * * of us who looked on our little steamer went on her way toward * point and then to the navy yard our disappointment was very great and as we were * home my uncle said * by george it looks as if the lord was on the side of those * yankees it was the first time i had ever heard him admit the possibility that * could be on the wrong side of anything we heard later that so certain seemed the destruction of the * her captain was making preparations to fire and * her when to his surprise the * or virginia as we * her turned * our captain afterward explained that he thought his

and june # 1862 picketts brigade played a most important and gallant part an account of which may be seen in general joseph e * report and in general picketts own report as given in pickett and his men while the battle yet * darkness came on to force a * general johnston ordered his troops to sleep on their lines to be ready for the morning * after seven he was slightly wounded by a * shot a little later he remarked to one of his * who * a shell there is no use in * like that colonel when you hear the things they have passed at that moment a shell * striking him in the breast he fell * into the arms of * l * one of his * on * consciousness he * his sword and * and said my father wore that sword in the * war and i would not lose it for ten thousand dollars the * colonel * the * gave me both sword and * were recovered and general johnston the natural * for * an officer of the highest * qualities of military skill and * * by few and * by none was carried off the field severely wounded general robert e lee was appointed to the command of the army of northern virginia to become the * of his people and one of the greatest military leaders of the world greater than will ever be known because of the * laid upon his power though he was the general in command he was under the direction of the war department which * its authority to the * perhaps our confederacy might have been longer lived if lee had adopted the policy of stonewall jackson who when ordered to recall general * from * * like a soldier and promptly sent in his resignation like a mere human if i could bring before you the picture of the richmond i saw after the battle of seven pines you would say that it was the most powerful peace * ever * but no words could give you the * shadow of the richmond of those days of * could * have looked upon our capital in that opening june he would have needed no * to * for him the * of * no * to lead him through the midnight * of a lost world to the * chamber of * souls he would have turned his gaze upon our streets * his pen in his hearts blood and written and * would have * through all the * to come richmond was * with the * of the battle and the * * through our * souls the blood of the field was running in * of red through the hearts of her people for days the * and * * their tragic way from the battlefield to the capital city and every turn of their * * rolled over our crushed and * hearts the wretched * of wounded were * before the doors of the * * until they * with * humanity and all hearts and hands were full of grief for the dead and work for the wounded there was not a home in the city that held not some * offering from the battlefield every possible space was * into a * hospital and all was done that * * and gentle care could effect for the * in the ranks as tenderly as for those who wore the stars women girls and children stood before the doors with wine and food for the wounded as they passed it was not unusual to see half a dozen funeral * at the same time on their way to the city of the dead the capitol square was filled with officers * and citizens * information of the battle from all the * poured in letters from friends and relatives with the sacred charge to care for their loved ones from all quarters of the confederacy * followed their husbands mothers their sons come * here is a telegram from mrs b said my * come dear and go with me to the train to meet her how i dread it poor dear lady there was a * faith in the * face that met us in the * faith that lifted up our hearts to the heights of * there was no question no fear in the * loving eyes * come to see my boy he was with general johnston she said we drove back through a mourning richmond a strange foreign richmond that the mother did not know from the doors of the houses hung * of black * filled with wounded passed us their * road marked by the * of blood that * drop by drop from human * wagons filled with dead rolled by the * bodies * one upon another in * * the rigid feet * from the * of the * it was the most * sight that ever greeted human eyes but it was the only way to save our fallen soldiers from the * of birds of * all the * of every description were * the less severely wounded walking their * bound in bloody * they formed a long * nearly five thousand young boys * and old men from * to high officers passing on to the homes of richmond where they would find tender care from some of the open windows came * of pain from those whose courage had been * by * agony down the streets new regiments were marching to the front to fill in time other * and * sometimes the richmond of those days comes back to me now and i * * with terror reaching the beautiful home of our friend and * we hurried our beloved charge this sweet mother of a soldier through * where closed doors guarded scenes which could be but * * up the * and along the hall to a small room she followed our friend who sent me down to order up a * of * on my return she came out to meet me she does not know * ah who will tell her heaven help her heaven help her later i saw her go with firm step erect form and * face and stop silently as if in prayer at a closed door some one had told her the door opened and she passed through then it gently shut leaving her alone with her dead for months on to richmond had been the * of the federals and the battle of * mill june # 1862 was the turning point of the seven days battles around our capital no event of the * campaign which had followed that * was more important in its results than this desperate conflict mcclellan in his retreat had burned and destroyed everything that could be carried away until he reached * farm known also by the names of * mill and cold harbor and there was fought the greatest battle of the war up to that time the great stage * nature had never arranged a more * scene for a battle than that which was set for * mill one of the most awful * of the war it was an * plain * rising into gentle * crowned by a dense * of trees it * in a tall * a great * mass of rock which had been * from its native bed so many * ago as to be now covered with a large forest directly in front of the * separated by a deep * was a low * field * covered by a heavy * of * which together with a natural * of * * * to mcclellans sharpshooters and lines of skirmishers the * was * by three * of field artillery and a heavy infantry support picketts brigade formed in line of battle under the brow of the hill and my soldier leading and cheering on his men in * the * was shot from his horse his shoulder was * by a * ball and his * * wanted to take him off the field saying the ball must be removed at once my men need me replied my soldier take the * out here and * me up quick doctor i must go * they need me the surgeon * the ball and my soldier continued to give orders until weak from pain and loss of blood he was carried from the field for some weeks he was on * at his home in richmond and in july i was permitted to make my first call here i met for the second time jefferson davis now president of the confederacy i had just taken my seat by my wounded soldier when the president was announced and to my * * i saw the precious minutes * away while he occupied my chair and i sat in a corner with mrs * my soldiers only sister in spite of my green * i could not help forming a mental picture of the man who had been chosen as our political head he was tall and * slender but of * dignity and grace he was a * of the old south * * a brilliant * his eyes were clear and of a * color he had a high forehead straight nose thin * lips pointed * prominent cheek * and deep lines around his mouth his face was thin features long and sharp expression intense there was no * in his movements neither was there anything * his walk was wonderful just what a presidents walk ought to be but * is when he rode the beautiful * * and grace of every motion were * he pressed my soldiers left hand * it gently down on the arm of the chair to avoid * him how soon will you be able to go back he asked we need you in the field i should like to go tomorrow was the reply the president shook his head and entered upon a brief account of the fighting after the battle of * mill * my soldiers brother major charles pickett who had been wounded at * farm carrying the flag on foot after his horse had been shot from under him i saw the presidents eyes * as he said i am too much of a soldier to keep out of it in this way i want to be in the * i would much have preferred fighting in the field to * in the council chamber i had gone out to * with the generals when the artillery * between jackson and franklin began i * * being * shot and was carried off by force then they talked of the time when they fought in mexico on my next visit to my soldier i met stonewall jackson whom i had seen once in my childhood when i went with my grandmother to visit my uncle colonel j j * who was under him as a * at the virginia military * and was afterward * with him as a professor in the same institution later i had heard my soldier talk of him as the man of the war the greatest military character * in that fiery time even thus early the world began to know him for what he was he came to see my soldier and asked after his * general jackson talked of * mill and said that general * of his command had lost his way and not knowing where to find his commander had reported to general longstreet who put his brigade a little in the rear of picketts men so that the two

had then learned his worth and her * led him to withdraw his resignation but he was never again * by instructions from the war department it was said in the army that general jackson was afraid of nothing but his own soldiers their * of devotion * him riding his * * his tall powerful form bent forward his long solemn face with high cheek * half lost in heavy * * his gray eyes cast * when he *

saying that his old friend dr * a celebrated minister who had just * made his escape from prison in his daughters clothes would pass through lynchburg the following day and would escort me home though sorry to make a break in our * i was glad to go as it * the plan of my soldier which i had feared would go * to meet me in petersburg where i was to stop over for a few days on my way home on the train the doctor said * i found to my delight the son of an old friend in the forward * whom i would like to present to you if i may i have just told him i was * with a little * or a little * who was making me forget age and * and * a * of sunshine but a * bit of a * * * tell you what else i said nor half the things he told me in reply about * you against a certain young lady of his acquaintance which young lady i am * to think is more than an acquaintance so i give you fair warning not to fall in love with him i replied that i should be delighted to meet his friend but needed no warning as i had an acquaintance too who was more than an acquaintance and whom i would * against the entire * i was * the remainder of our * out of the window to a * hungry looking soldier when the doctor returned with his friend and said miss * allow me to present to you the son of my old friend of * county virginia general pickett my heart * into my throat with delight and surprise and in * * i cried * my soldier my soldier i had no idea whom i was to have the honor of meeting said my soldier this doctor is the acquaintance of whom i spoke * said the doctor * he offered my soldier his seat beside me and the rest of the journey was a beautiful beautiful * dream my soldier stopped off at richmond and i went on to petersburg where i was the guest of mr and mrs * my friends in petersburg had announced my coming and a number of * had been made for me the first was a large party at the * and the next at the * i did not know whether my soldier would * of my going without him and i neither wished to go nor * of it myself so i begged to be allowed to * his arrival the next day and make my first appearance with him on seeing his look of loving * i was very * to have made the decision the party at the * was one of the * and most brilliant ever given in petersburg and that evening our engagement was announced two days later i was to start for my fathers home but was * especially as my soldier was in command to find that i could not get a permit he was * in his * and would make no * in my favor however he * to date for me a permit a week in advance at the end of the week i said goodbye to him at the station and for the first time was wounded by him almost * because he did not seem as sorry at parting from me as i thought he ought to be besides there was a peculiar * * in his eye that * me and occupied my thoughts all the way down to * station where my uncle doctor * met me though * because the parting had seemed of so little moment to my soldier and * that i had not been sorry either that is not so sorry as i was the drive from the station proved most pleasant and brought us to my * near noon that evening as i was about to retire a little after eight they go to bed early in the country we heard horses * down the * listen to the * of the * said my uncle those are certainly soldiers and i did not know there were any within miles of us i listened heard the horses turned over to the * heard * on the * then on the * and in answer to my * * i recognized with * joy the voice of my own soldier and that of one of his staff they were asking for me had been * and the * was * them into the parlor the dread * of my soldiers * at parting from me was explained he had come through on the same day with a part of his division and they were then in camp on the * a few miles distant when the division crossed the * and marched on to * i went to the home of my aunt mrs * at * cross roads a distance of about ten miles from * here when all was quiet along the lines my soldier would ride in from his headquarters almost every night between the hours of sunset and sunrise to see * ride of about thirty miles while these short visits were * of heaven to me they resulted sadly for my aunt whose house in consequence was burned by the federals at the earnest * of my soldier who feared my remaining within the enemys lines i went to an old friend in richmond mrs * the wife of colonel * when on this visit i first met general * stuart the red * of the confederacy thus named because of the * glory of his * and the * of his movements as well as his * in * pursuit he was said to be one of the * men in the south and perhaps it was true but i was at that time too much absorbed in the * of the to me * man in the world to have * eyes for the beauty of * else among those of our officers most noted for personal * was general longstreet who was thought to * * in appearance a story is told of an * * of the red * who meeting the old war horse general longstreet said general stuart i just met a man who told me of * you for general longstreet but i dont see how he could longstreet is not half as handsome as you are general longstreet * replied yes i am sometimes taken for longstreet as we * at a ball at yellow tavern general stuart * * my soldier on his bad * in belonging to the infantry i am sorry for pickett poor fellow he has to walk upon my word he ought to be in the cavalry he * it what a pity and you miss * should you throw yourself away on the infantry you ought to marry a * i tried to defend myself and set forth the greater * of the infantry service pickett is * he replied in having such a * i am in love with him myself and * with you perfectly for pickett can do anything when i see him dance i think he ought to be a * when i see him ride i think he ought to be a cavalry leader when he * i think he ought to be a bird when he * it seems that he ought to be an * star when i see him lead a charge i feel that he ought to spend his life on the battlefield yes pickett can do anything and do it well as for poor * i can do is to make love * as i was i knew that the red * could do everything that was brave and fine and great as for making * was only one who knew his power in that * lovely woman who possessed all his gallant heart and has * borne his great name through years of wearing * and lonely sorrow in the battle or on the road a song or a laugh was always on his lips and the hearts of his men leaped up to meet his * as well as his * to few men is it given to go through a great war * by any ball except the fatal one such was the * that * * upon his brilliant * and in less than a year from that * night at this same yellow tavern the * * was set upon a youth that was * notwithstanding war and * * when i should be * into the world with a * in my hand and the * of my * * on my head my soldier was to marry me * does not * give way to * and in our southern country a * between * calls was * to be filled with the music of wedding * but * was in the * for the time and when i was * the army of northern virginia was marching to an * battlefield in pennsylvania then came gettysburg and the wave of triumph set * at fredericksburg and * higher at chancellorsville * * for the first news that came to us was of a great victory so we rode on the * of * success and fell with the * soon after the battle my soldier returned to * his division on sunday we walked down broad street to the * * church it was the first time we had gone to church together and he was telling me that this church was called the * because it was built upon the * of the old richmond * burned in # my soldiers grandmother was a victim of the fire as were the governor of virginia and more than sixty of * best known citizens the fire and the long funeral * had been described to him by those who held in memory the mournful * * the streets of the beautiful city as death had * the lives of the thousands who followed their loved ones for the last time on earth as we went down broad street hill we saw a little * child standing first on one foot and then on the other crying he had * his * hands on his * face until it was covered with * * come come my little man what is the matter asked my soldier my shoes is a * an * me so they * like i was a * on * * * * i cant walk i cant get * at all * my soldier * and took off the shoes * the little feet tied the shoes together handed them to the boy and with his own * * * away the tears * the child in his arms he carried him home some three * farther on we went our way and as i walked beside my soldier in his gray uniform * with the glory and the gloom of the * greatest battle i felt * of the simple sweet nature offering sympathy and aid to one of the least of these than of all the * of the soldier on the field only a few days before he had * from gettysburg to richmond cheer after cheer following him along the way men women and children were at the * to welcome him and * * on his horse he had been the * figure in a scene so supreme that it needed not victory to crown it with glory yet not the flowers of love nor the * of the * thunder the grave duties nor the heavy * that were laid upon him could so fill his heart as to leave no room for the cry of suffering from an unknown child in september of that year my soldier married me he had * in general longstreet and asked for a * the corps commander replied that they were not * * but he said with that * in his eye so well remembered by all who knew general lees old war horse i might * you for special duty and you could stop off and be married so my soldier was * for special duty unfortunately the federals south of the line were at that time * * at the * of * for them * was absolutely * so much opposed were they to our marriage and so * in their efforts to * my soldier to pay them a * visit instead of * his time in wedding * that it became necessary for me to cross the lines this i did with the assistance of my uncle doctor john t * who took my father and me under his protection * us across my father driving a * of * in which my * were concealed my mother could not leave my little baby brother now dr * f * an * and beloved physician of north carolina to go with me so i was accompanied by one of her friends as * i * * when we met some federal * but kept up a brave front and * dr * the * allowed his permit to cover the party and we passed on our way at * station we were met by my uncle colonel j j * and his wife and by my soldiers brother and aunt and uncle miss * and mr * johnston with them we went on to petersburg and on september # 1863 in st * church the marriage took place we left for richmond amid the * of guns * cheers the * of * and the music of * and * as by that time the food supply of the south was reduced to narrow limits * being * by * up and * the earth from under the * * sweet * cut into * and * * for coffee and * of * being sold at high * for the hospital * it might be thought that our * of finding a * awaiting us in richmond was not brilliant but friends and relations of my soldier had * themselves to do him honor and the result was such as had not been seen in virginia for many a day it was * season and so generous was the supply that the * was afterward known as the wedding * the birds had been killed at night with * for the south was not * her small store of ammunition on * with so many more important * in sight the birds killed at * neck on the james river and thousands of * * * of * * and * * and made into * by the * and the old plantation servants under the * of mr and mrs * the * and his wife at * island my soldiers old * home were sent us as * * mrs robert e lees * was a * the making of which she had * and * * mother sent us a black * that had been put away for her own golden wedding the only men in * evening dress were mr davis and his cabinet and a few * and very old men for even then we were * the * and the grave to * the army and the women were * everything to help through kindness of friends in norfolk a handsome * dress * for me by mrs * had been * across the line it was so unusual that after mrs davis had greeted me she looked in astonishment at my * and said child where did you get these clothes turning to the general smiling mr davis asked where did you get the little lady in the clothes on the other side of the room was the editor of the richmond * who had been * * the administration mrs davis called her husbands attention to him but mr davis said let us not look that way my dear we have come tonight to see beautiful things and think pleasant thoughts the generals sister invited the president and mrs davis to the diningroom what a time you must have had * them said mr davis when he saw the * a part of the * was the preparation of them even to the last * of * my memory of mr davis that evening * with special * because it was the last time that i ever saw real happiness in his earnest face he was just a free gallant gentleman that night as he said he had come to enjoy clouds public and private were gathering and soon enough there was no longer the possibility of * i saw him often afterward in * but never again with the light of joy on his face perhaps there was never * else so * a * of * for the * of the person as i had assembled for a * i had * * from court * more than a century old * of

for it was of white * and exquisite * lace made at a * of * in passing i may remark that the possession of a real wedding dress new and * was a * that carried with it a sense of * to the community at

home dead from the battlefield thus * * the dress around which * so many happy memories so many tender * and so many * * was laid away with * hands never again to * with soft * through the * folds of the * veil my soldier was at this time assigned to the department of north carolina with headquarters at petersburg virginia commanding all that part of virginia between james river on the north and * fear river on the south reaching * to the federal lines around * and * to the black water and * including all the troops in that region after our * visits to * we returned to petersburg where we found that our friends in spite of the * of war had arranged beautiful rooms for us * them * with flowers and * them up * among the many who helped to make my life happy in petersburg was major charles pickett the generals * * general the little major as he was affectionately called by the soldiers when my soldier introduced him to me as his little brother he immediately became my little brother too and thus he was in my life and my heart through all the years that he remained on earth he walked slightly * from a wound received at * farm so anxious was he to get into the fight that he * orders to report for staff duty in richmond and went into the battle instead when he was shot he begged his comrades not to carry him off the field but to leave him his flag that he might die under its folds but he lived through what was known among the men as the battle the little major fought down at * farm and thus i came into possession of my little brother soon afterward he married miss * smith of washington and brought us a dear sister who was my companion in the rare sunshine and the many * of war all this region was * and held * memories of the battles of * days as we rode over the ground we talked of the * * and my soldier said that he would have been glad to be in all * that were for a just cause i had been taught that the mexican war was without such * and asked his opinion at west point he replied some of us were * for * a doubt of its justice i was one of them after we were in we had to fight it out and as it must be done i wanted to do my share it was while my soldier was stationed at petersburg that the expedition to north carolina was * * * and * the military history of the movement is given in pickett and his men but there are certain personal features of the expedition which have been * in my memory for i would not be left behind when the journey to the old north state was made i went as far as the house of a friend on the * road the night was * and * we were * our * place my soldier always * for his men was * with his staff the * to which they would be * and the * of * their suffering poor fellows he said they will be almost * and no wood and general lee will not allow us to burn even a single * there will be the devil to pay and i * to help * that i had * and heard his last remark he turned * to captain bright saying bright how dare you use that * name in the presence of my wife beg your pardon sister said captain bright i thought you were asleep whatever * my soldier might bear to his staff officers i was always sister dont you think i know your voice my dear from captain * i * no little one you could not possibly know my voice in connection with such words and you could not think that i would use such language as bright * sister said captain bright before the general was married he would not allow any of us to * at all he said he would do the * for the whole division now that he is married we have not only to do all our own * but his too had it not been for the * imagination of colonel * the * of the * virginia regiment my soldier and i would probably have * * the hotel was impossible and the community was of union sentiment in our connection with the southern army we could expect no * in this * colonel * * to * with the situation he learned that the most beautiful and * home in the village was * by an old * a power in the church and in the community who was known to be not * to make an * sacrifice of political opinions to religious * colonel * called upon the good brother and with an * that he could have learned * but from the * and * * of that region and period said my dear brother i know what a good * you are and how ready you are to help all your * in the lord i have my good general brother pickett out here with his dear * wife sister pickett both good * and i beg you to * to them the * of your home and * them as best you can for the sake of * love if i do said the old man * the yankees may burn my house but i must take the * i cannot let my * suffer yes let the good brother and sister come in and share what i have we were received with * * our host * hands with us * saying how do you do brother pickett how are you sister pickett in a voice that * us with the * of the church i was interested to * that our host had but one eye his wife was * and their daughter was * these * * were afterward * explained by our * brother i was engaged to a * girl he said and my people * to the marriage i was about to give it up when one day i was * wood and the end of the * * up and * me in the eye and put it out it was the judgment of the lord and i * and married my * girl then when our girl was born the hand of the * angel touched her and she was * to keep me in mind of my sin petersburg the gate to richmond was the * point of the confederacy and my soldier had explained its position to the authorities in richmond and asked that provision for its defense should be made his warning * he wrote a * letter on the subject to general lee who sent an officer to richmond * immediate action still nothing was done and when on the #* of may butler with thirty thousand troops moved upon the town which was * by only six hundred men two hundred of whom were * the government and the country were as much surprised as if they had never heard of the danger though my soldier had been ordered a few days before to report to the army of northern virginia he could not leave petersburg to destruction in * of orders he remained in the * city the day after the attack a part of the south carolina brigade came in and being placed at * junction about six miles from petersburg drove back * advance column * virginia brigade arrived on the * and was sent toward city point then three brigades of picketts division began coming in as fast as the * express could bring them and we had eleven pieces of artillery we women carried the * * the food and took it to the men at the guns at train time we would go to the station and send up cheer after cheer of welcome hoping to blind the federals to the fact that the cars returning from their short trip to the country brought in only the * railroad men the roar of cannon and the * of shot and shell filled our ears day and night during the entire week until petersburg was safe and general grant had sent his famous telegram to mr lincoln pickett has * up butler at petersburg my soldier scarcely slept and i saw him only when i carried to him on the lines a * or his bread and * and coffee this telegram so * butler that he came up the james river out of the line of battle at great * to the united states government and * and burned my soldiers beautiful * home the city council of petersburg * a resolution of thanks to my soldier for his brave defense of the city the people wished to express their gratitude by a * to me it was impossible to buy a service of silver so each brought a * a * a * as the case might be until more than a thousand pieces were given to me one woman having no silver because she had been compelled to * her household service brought a pretty * cup the * of affection were of far greater value to me than the most * and * new set of silver could have been and were carefully * until in the fire which marked the surrender of richmond they with all my * * and everything of value were burned in the * in richmond where they had been placed for * one morning in may in the early dawn we rode out of the city of sweet memories and days of terror * to look back at the * church of * * * by the rising sun where we had * our * our next station was on the * hundred lines near the heart of the storm but there were * of sunshine to break the gloom a tent was our first home and later a * * major charles picketts * * near our own had two rooms a degree of * to which no one else * we had * friends as war * together with * that can never be broken the * of many of the officers were there the few new books we had were exchanged until they were read through and through and almost learned by heart if one of us fortunately came into possession of a * paper it went the * and was more eagerly * than are the morning * now just off the press with the news of the hour fresh and hot we visited walked talked rode and * half the night away lest it should be * and bring * dreams how could we live on the * of a * if we could not dance around its * at the * house not all our * were given over to pleasure the federals had a theory that business should come first and would thrust their views upon us at * times frequently * us from * these * * were * scenes from the * * against the black * of * * through the darkness guns * across the silence that had * over the earth * * the roar of orders * over the * the * sounds of battle * through a * that * our world he who has looked upon such a scene needs no * of darkness to roll back for him the heavy * that * the world of * even the * of the brave * their courage in a night attack after one of these * when the wounded were brought in i saw my soldier stop beside two of them one a federal and the other a confederate * to the northern soldier he said please attend first to our guest doctor then he gave his * to serve as a * to stop the * of the federal soldiers wound it was at the * hundred line that i first saw general grant my soldier and i were riding along looking at the federal gunboats and * not more than a few hundred yards from our headquarters when i saw a * of smoke * * a mere shadow as it floated higher and was lost against the blue sky look look i exclaimed * that beautiful * beautiful it is from a shell the enemy are firing over there come dear * up your horse and let me get you out of this as soon as i can no indeed i said * not a bit afraid and if i were do you think i would let picketts men see me run come dear please you are in danger useless danger and that is not * the soldiers did not seem to * with him for * brigade sent up cheer after cheer as we passed captain smith just then riding across the field stopped to speak to us the federals are * some guns i think for the * of visitors he explained and are not firing at us they are over there to the right of that oak he handed us his field glass mrs grant is standing between those two short * men the one at the left with a cigar in his mouth is grant the * * one on the right is * grants * yes thats * see him laugh the old * said my soldier a * of the * affection shining in his eyes and * in his voice he grant and * were old friends having been comrades in mexico and the west but come * ride on yes said captain smith it is not safe here i would take mrs pickett away turn to the left there into that * of trees unfortunately captain mrs pickett * me she will not go permit me please mrs pickett to add my * to those of the general it really is not safe here let me get down and try our guns too and then ill go i answered not for the world exclaimed my soldier they are not * at us mrs grant is so * that she would not * of their * in this direction if she thought it would * our morning ride besides she is exceedingly * and does not know * the captain * my soldier lifted his hat to me * pointed to the * on our left and rode away i watched him * his fine * beginning to feel * for my obstinate resistance to his appeal i was about to turn off to the safe path when one of the * cannon * swept across the field and i saw the * horse * * along bearing a * body * i sprang from my horse and ran and picked up the poor head and i * believe that the dying eyes looked their thanks as the last * of life * out those * grateful eyes have looked at me many times through the * of * years and with them has come the * of the guns that threw black bars across the sunshine of that far away morning the memory of general grant often came to me afterward * with that awful sight following my first view of him across the water where he stood * * on the slope the fact that he remembered the old friendship with my soldier was impressed upon me many times after my view of him through field * among the friends whom i often met at this station was general robert e lee it has been said that our commanding general never knew or * what he * and it is true that he did not in comparison with the * of his soldiers once when he and his staff * with us i gave them one of our famous * * made of * a * of * corn * and * * with * and * * and * slowly it was particularly good this day as i had received a * of some * * and could afford to use it * and general lee said the * was the most * thing he had ever * i had just made some * * of which i was very proud he * them and told me that in his house he had them many years old and that the older they became the better they were but you know he said i never eat anything good without thinking of the soldiers and their * one evening in richmond my soldier and i were invited to spend the evening with senator and mrs * c clay and while there general lee called we had * * made of * and * with * and * made with * from the * of our * she remarked that she had been * those * for the soldiers in the hospital but that she had more which she would give to them if you will be sure not to forget the soldiers said general lee i will enjoy this * the general called me sweet * because i came from * county as did the famous sweet * which the * * about the streets calling out * sweet * and i rather * this * suggestion not * to be * with * even in the mind of general lee though * and * our general had a natural dignity of manner which though * confidence * a veil of reserve between him and even his * * years after the war one of my friends who had been an officer in the army of northern virginia first under general joe johnston and then under general lee said to me lee was a great soldier and a good man but i never wanted to put my arms around his neck and kiss him as i wanted to do with joe johnston with a bit of a * feeling for my own soldier i asked did you want to do that to general pickett to * i not only wanted to but i did one evening when general lee general beauregard my soldier and his brigade commanders were * * in our * and * * the * of the slaves and the * of them as soldiers general lee finished by saying well gentlemen we must hope for the best if we should give up there are many who would feel that we had sold the * of our southern states would think so for even they have no idea that we have come to the last of our resources and no * of how * and poor we are and alas gentlemen too much of the best blood of the land is being * too many homes being * and made desolate too many mothers with broken hearts * they shook hands and general lee and his companions * off my soldier and i standing in the * listening hear the horses * saying * * said i so they do little one answered my soldier * i had not thought of that before we turned to the * on the floor and rolled up the ways to go and prayed for a * to bring success we were near the federal lines and the men on the * sides enjoyed friendly * with each other * * * * for coffee and exchanged newspapers the federals kept their * in a * in the rear of their camp early one morning they were surprised to see confederate soldiers running along the line in a manner * of a drove of * excited * * the matter with you * over there came the * across the lines are you all * the only answer was a * and * out * of * * * * with the * * of their * the * gave up the * a little while later the * was * in the night general j e b stuart with some of his men had * the camp and driven off all the federal * and the * of the confederates was a * * to the * of their loss for a time the * * * on * and * while the * were compelled to * till they could lay in a new supply of live * the red flag of the * never * divided the hearts of the soldiers into * camps not only did the west * * the * of the old

of him taken in his federal uniform before he was captured the close of the * career of the confederacy was marked in blood by the battle of five forks the end was at hand the army had * on corn for many days as my soldier was riding to * creek a woman ran out of a house by the * and handed him a * wrapped in paper passing on he saw a man lying behind a * a * he supposed what did it matter the

dont know about that i have given passes to about two hundred and fifty thousand men during the last two years to go to richmond and not one of them has got there yet some of those passes had been

the capitol and in a few moments for the first time in more than four years the national flag * * in the * of the south the stars of the union were * while our * * took its flight to meet the * soul that flag which almost a century before had * from the clouds of war like a star * out through the darkness of a * night with its design * to both washington and john * was raised over virginia by

and will also bear witness to the * courtesy of major * and the * with which he kept his trust the day after the fire there was a * at our door the servants had all run away the city was full of northern troops and my * had not taught me to love them with my baby on my arm i answered the * opened the door and looked up at a tall * * man in ill * clothes who asked with the * of the north is this george picketts place this is general picketts home sir i replied but he is not here i know that * i know where george pickett is he answered but i just wanted to see the place down in old * * where i used to hear george pickett * the songs of virginia in his * notes i have heard him describe his home till in spirit i have been here many a time i have * the * roses and the lady * roses and the golden * roses and those great * roses i have seen the * of * in the * and the * * in the * corner the * of violets the * of * and the * that the * knew were * had been * just for them i have stood under the * and gathered those strange green looking * that are like the virginia * growing each one on its own individual * i think he called them * i have sat on that back * and listened to the music as his sister virginia of whom he was so proud sang in that glorious voice he told me about and i have swung in this old * here while the moon and i watched and waited for the old * to die so i wanted to see the place i listening wondered who he could be till he finished and then he said i am * lincoln the president i * * * lincoln george picketts old friend i am george picketts wife and this is his baby was all i could say the baby reached out his arms and mr lincoln took him a look of tenderness almost * * that sad face i have never seen that expression on any other face my little one opened his mouth and insisted upon giving his fathers friend a * baby kiss as he handed my baby back to me mr lincoln shook his long hand at him and said tell your father the * that i could almost forgive him anything for the sake of those bright eyes and that baby kiss the tones of his deep voice touched all the * of life to music and i * no more at my soldiers love for him even through all the bitterness of the years he turned and went down the steps and out of my life forever but in my memory that wonderful voice those * human eyes that strong sad tender face have a * * place he seemed to have a cast in his eye that * me of the glass eye of mr davis but as no one has ever mentioned it in * him it may be that his * to jefferson davis made me think so yet i always see that look in his pictures among my * * are some old letters written by mr lincoln when * law in * to george pickett then a * at west point where he was placed at the request of mr lincoln the * and * * of these letters the * which * through them the cheerful * upon life and the ready sympathy of the * * man with the boy just on the * of life looking down the * of the future to the * of * and the thunder of guns all bring him before me as a friend i look beyond the description he once gave of himself height six feet four * nearly * in flesh * on an * one hundred and * * dark * with * black hair and gray eyes a * * like that is easy but my memory * the * with the * beauty of soul the * view of life the deep tender sympathy that made up a face of * * which * all * but revealed itself to the * of a child * the * to * its little arms to be taken up and its lips to be kissed the ways of * lincoln and george pickett were * separated for a time but were never so far apart that the old love had not full * i * over it once but after my own picture of the man was filled out i wondered no more i think no one who knew and loved lincoln could be * from him whatever * of political * might roll between one afternoon as we were reading * * upon the * our attention was * by a number of soldiers below who were * the * * and saying all manner of * things about mr lincoln * him as ignorant and * and bringing other * * against him after they were gone my soldier walked up and down the * * when other friends are round * presently coming back sitting beside me and taking hold of my hand he said years ago there was a very * * disappointed * boy away off in * * he had received letters not in * as they come now for that was a long time ago when the letter made its own * paper was * then than now and one had to be careful in opening the letter it was fastened with * * and in breaking the * it often happened that a word was broken off he had opened three of those letters and found that four of his cousins had been appointed to west point three from virginia and one from kentucky and he was compelled to study law a subject which he did not like but which his family did and had chosen for him his uncle with whom he was * had no sympathy with his ambition to be a soldier and his disappointment in not being of the fortunate number that night when this * boy was leaning on the gate still * over his disappointment but * trying to * the rule in * case a tall man for whom he was waiting came up the street and asked what is the matter * in your pocket and your * and * all dropped out yes said the boy i have lost my * and my * and there are big * in my * well replied the man you must have strong * like mine i have * and a * but my * are so strong now that they do not make * in them as they used to do come sit down on the grass and * have a game of * the man played so * on purpose that it was he who had to * the * but his * insisted that he should * it no you have been * the * all day my boy i want to keep you from * * the next morning the boy was * by a * of * thrown against the window he looked out and saw his friend with * in his hand going up the road a piece he called out it took the man a long time to go up the road and the boy waited for him week after week to come down the road after a long time there came instead a letter from which the following is an * * in this letter was one from mr john g stuart * in congress of the third * * together with an appointment to west point my soldier was silent for a moment then continued that man is the one we have just heard * the man to whom i your soldier * his * the one to whom he is * for the * that were hung around his horse all along the road as he came from gettysburg the one whose * and courage enabled your soldier to * the british * at * * and to whom he * the gratitude of the people of petersburg who say that he saved their * man was * lincoln months afterward when the awful news of * death came to us my soldier exclaimed my god my god the south has lost her best friend and * in this her * hour of need my soldier left me in richmond when he went away to fight the last battles of the war telling me to stay until he returned or sent for me now remember i shall surely come back he said so like * i waited and not even the flames that * the battles * should * me away general * our secretary of war had in his * offered me an opportunity of leaving the confederate capital but * that my soldier had left me there i * determined to remain until he came or sent for me * the secretary i said i cannot go until the voice that bade me stay calls me the days were filled with fear and * * the * struck only midnight hours for me * of the death of my soldier were * i saw by the look on * face though no word was said and i would not ask a question nor let * speak to me of him lest an effort be made to prepare me for the sad * the last letter i had received from him was * the 30th of march at * run the extreme right of the confederate line most of the letter being written in * that i only might understand it contained the following * he wrote in full faith of a short separation saying that all would be well that he would surely return * me not to listen to or credit any * to the contrary and * me in an added line to be brave and of good * keep up a * * * for brave heart always his last words to me in parting this letter was brought to me by * a daring * * in my soldiers * as headquarters * he was * and loyal perfectly devoted to the general and his cause and was trusted with letters of the * confidence and greatest importance all through the war as i said before our people were on the * of * for weeks before we left camp the army had been living on rations of corn and * with * of * the game had been * and killed throughout the whole country and my breakfast that morning had consisted of a few * * in water no * for * had long been a * in the confederacy all the old * had been moved that the earth might be * up and * down to recover the * which in the many years it had absorbed john * my dear little brother nine years old was a great comfort to me in these days of trial he had just brought my * and was * * me to eat them when * came and a * was filled for him after * had finished his * breakfast * with his * on the road * the river at one place carrying his clothes in a * on his head he said he must go i added a few lines to my * which i always kept for my soldier and gave it to our faithful * to take back to him * * days to come said * in his soft * voice * all lands no matter * people * * * money no matter you find * * here first putting his hand over his heart and then drawing from his * and * * a shining * * at the door he turned back * his * and * out five pieces of money three gold dollars and two * he walked over on * to where the baby was sleeping crossed himself and * by the * slipped into * little closed hand two of the gold dollars and around his neck a much worn and * * * * * good * now * * * want some want her * bad before you * get her * some * dear faithful old * he would take no * so i let baby keep the money i was * by the * crying and praying for my soldier and * god that he had so good a friend as this poor camp * when the door opened softly and * looked in i know you * and so i come back to say * some * and god bless i was reading aloud * and * the torn words on the ragged * * which * had given to baby * the heart of * is with you when the baby opened his sweet eyes and * over the little fortune which had come to him in his dreams the first gold he had ever seen just then my little brother who had gone * with * came * back his eyes wide open all excitement * sister sister * a yankee * come to see you but dont you go * * sister ill stand by the door and he * pass by me quick sister * he said that he was one of brother * friends but i believe he has killed brother george and now wants to kill you in the light of the present day the terror of the child seems almost * but in those days southern * kept children * by warning them that the yankees would get them if they did not * and the whole * of childhood * the fear thus * oh no no my child i said * trying to * and calm him no no dont be such a little * dear if he is one of your brother * friends he is mine too and he would not hurt me i am not in the least afraid and i will go down at once and see him please dont go sister you might be killed and i promised brother george to take care of you thats a sweet boy take care of the baby i said and * them both closed the door behind me as i entered the parlor a tall thin gentleman with the * of smiles and the * of voices dressed in the uniform of a united states surgeon arose and said as he bowed holding his hat against his breast thus * offering me his hand my name is george * madam i am one of george picketts friends although as soldiers we have been enemies in the field for more than three years that however does not * with us when we are not on duty i have heard that you southern women are very bitter and i did not know how you his * are picketts wife are you not * take a visit from me but i came nevertheless knowing and loving george pickett as i do i knew he would appreciate my * in coming your name is a very familiar one dr * i said i have often heard the general speak of you and recall many stories of your * love for * and * for all natural history in fact i wished him to know that i remembered him and had not mistaken him for another and also that i had reason to wonder at seeing him in his present position he spoke of your having been with him at fort * bay and knowing how you felt when he left the old army he wondered at your remaining and going to the front i am a surgeon in grants army said dr * * * and by his manner almost * my reference to his former sympathy with the south i love pickett and came as he would have come had our positions been * to see his wife and offer her my services i * this * gentleman and distinguished officer but was too bitter to accept the * courtesy at his hands even in my husbands name and offered for loves * bitter that suffering was * to such * he bowed and was going when i said doctor is there any news of the * i mean the war is over madam you have my address if you should change your mind and will show me how i can serve you he bowed and left he too had heard that my soldier had been killed and believed it and i * him worse because of his belief on the evening of the #* of april i was walking the floor baby was asleep and my little brother was * behind me when i heard from the street grand victory at five forks pickett killed and his whole division captured it seemed very strange to me that in the streets of richmond his old home the capital of the confederacy the death of pickett and the capture of his whole division should be * as a grand victory how great a change had come in so short a time even the * had apparently gone over to the enemy * so sister * so dont you believe him said my little brother * my dress and * it then running to the window in his excitement he called out hush sir hush hush this minute * your big stories out loud and * everybody to death * like to * those five forks through your old black * for you * got any heart i know aint you ashamed of yourself you * old * you there aint a word of truth in brother george being killed and you know it you old thing ill go down and * his mouth for him and * him to death for * you so my poor sister * i would but it * so my sister you trust in the lord i know brother george is not killed for he said he * get killed no it is not so you are right my darling your brother george is not killed i said yes he will come back he will come back he said he would and he will thus i spoke and believed for my soldier had never broken a promise the days came and the days went and the sun rose each morning with an * glow of hope in its golden heart when * * out from the forest shadows the sun went down in a sea of crimson fire that burned out my dream of happiness then night fell and the world and my heart were wrapped in darkness one morning i had * dressed baby george and had taken him to the window to hear the spring sounds and * the spring * and catch the * * gold * the top of the * * of the * and * it was the time when the * of the year is in perfect * when all the world is * when the birds sing of love the * and * of joy the * and * of hope and faith and when each * of wind makes a * of * * through the * and * of leaves and * of flowers and soft * of * came the words * lucy * little girl oh those tones those words that voice * my heart so that i wonder it did not burst from very * such joy such gratitude as * my soul only the * of all good can know all the * and * and * of the past four years all the * and trials * and * of those last dreadful days were swept away by those blessed * * lucy spoken in my husbands tender tones to his horse i could not wait to go down * in the regular way it was too slow so i * down the * with my baby in my arms and ran out upon the * just as my soldier came around the * that mr lincoln had described and which had just * out baby and i were both in my soldiers arms almost before lucy had been given into the hands of the * i do not know how to describe the peace the * of that * is too deep and too sacred to be * into words i think that it is * to the feeling that will come to me in the * when i have gone through all these dark days of * and of * of heart and soul here * and at last am safe within the golden * and waiting and listening shall hear again the voice that said * lucy here * me welcome there as i * him after the * waiting all through the war lucy had brought my soldier to me * and beautiful she had many times carried him twenty miles in an evening to see me sometimes through * greater than battle lucy was not his * she was the little * * * my soldier always rode when he came to see me his * his * he called her * the generals * would say dat * lucy she marse * * * and you * * * dat * * * marse george is * as * to her as * she was * * real lady * the horse my soldier used in battle he called old black a steady * strong * animal that though * to his * touch or command allowed no one else on * of death to mount her we had no plans for the future our home on the james had been burned at the command of butler so we decided to go to my fathers plantation on the * in * county virginia a difficult thing to do for the * had been torn up and no * were running the little town of * was about thirty miles from norfolk * opposite * news and after the * of norfolk by the southern army all that part of the country was * ground being occupied one day by federal troops and another by confederate lying thus between the two lines a constant * was carried on by the * of both armies making it a dangerous region for travel i had not been home since my marriage and we knew that the loving welcome which awaited us there had but increased in * for the long absence * great * the * creek ran but a * throw from the back door * with but little labor * * * and * in * on the afternoon of the second day after my soldiers return while we were trying to plan a way to go my little brother * came running in saying sister i saw riding by the door just now that same yankee who came here to see you the other day and who said he was brother * friend he knew me and asked how you were and * the baby oh i forgot i must let you know all about it i said and told my soldier of the visitor who had called before he came back when i had finished his gray eyes filled with tears and looking at the * he said tenderly dear old * old * true i stooped and took my soldiers head in both my hands and raising it up gazed * into his earnest loving eyes to see how he could possibly speak so affectionately of a yankee you too have that same kind of * feeling that this yankee doctor spoke of having i said with surprise and rather * for me i am afraid i must find the dear old fellow my soldier said * * my * of spirit * himself and taking leave of baby and me he went out at once in a little while he returned saying it is very fortunate for us little one that i went out when i did * goes down the river tomorrow to norfolk in the * steamer and he has

been closer than brothers for four long years clasped hands in silence and parted the second social parting was sad too for they had taken me the child wife into their lives twenty months before and they all loved me and called me sister their pride in each other and in their command the * that together they had * the * * of good times and bad had bound them together in * stronger than * in spite of the * the loss of our cause our disappointment and * there was a sweet * peaceful feeling of * in my heart and gratitude because the war was over my husband had been spared and belonged now only to me we were going home together free from * to live our own lives the next morning dr * called in his headquarters * to take us to the steamer just at the close of breakfast we had announced our intention of going there was to be a sudden breaking up and * of old * the staff were all en route to their * homes except the * major charles pickett he and mrs dr * the only brother and sister of my soldier were to remain with their families for a time in the old pickett home we said our sad goodbye in the great * and flower garden at the rear of the house and passing all alone through the large * and wide * crept quietly out and softly closed the door behind us the only evidence of life in the dear old house as we looked back was dr * big dog which having escaped from the * * * within the * the * and * had not been opened or raised since the federal forces had occupied the city as we * the steamer that morning i realized for the first time that our cause was lost in all the days of our beautiful married life cheer after cheer had always greeted us wherever we had * from soldier or * whether on or off duty this morning these * were * by * of surprise of mingled curiosity and hate dr * recognized this feeling at once and with a * smile at my * expression of rage put his arm in that of my soldier and with a * glance at the men walked * on board i was shown into the * * in which there were many * of * care for my comfort we were soon under way my soldier and dr * called each other by their given names and laughed and talked as cordially as if they had loved the same dear cause and fought for it side by side at the table they * to each others health and to the friends and memories of * times a stranger could not have told which of the two soldiers had * his * they * of texas and the great * * which had changed the political * of the nation away back in what seemed to my youthful view a * * they talked of mexico and my general recalled * of the battles in which he had fought in that wonderful * country they * the wild free fresh * life of the * * coast the wealth of the * of * its * and * * and the friends they had known there they told stories of the great * that was like a * region to me of the * indians and of the * * island and the english officers who had occupied the island * with my soldier i found myself * if it had been a dream and there had been no * * just before reaching city point which is a few hours distance from richmond dr * came up and told me that we were to stop for general * grants * who wished to come on board to pay his * * me in his sweet * way to be more cordial with him than i had been with another of my soldiers old friends he turned for sympathy to my husband who looked * at him and at me presently my soldier drew me to one side and whispered * * my wishes my little wife and i want you to meet my old friend just as cordially as you can put your little hand in his and forget everything except that he is one of your husbands * and dearest friends i promised with all my heart what he asked and really intended to keep my word i loved to do everything he bade me i * him to make things hard for me sometimes that i might show him how * and loving my * was but when general * came on board was given a * and received as became his rank with the * the absence of which i had marked when my own general came i slipped my hand out of my soldiers and ran back to my * as fast as i could there i burst out crying and shook our baby * him and told him how his dear father had been * he had not had any * paid him at all and that a dreadful old bad yankee general had come on board and taken them all and that when he grew up and was a big man he must fight and fight and fight and never surrender and never forgive the yankees no not even if his poor * father asked him to do so i told him how his father had asked me to shake hands with this yankee general because he was his friend and that i was going to do it because his father wanted me to that i tried and could not and that he never must * never i did not know there was a witness to all my bitterness till i heard a * * and looking up saw my soldier and his friend general * * standing over me with a * in his eye and in a voice full of * laughter general * said as he * me on the head i dont * you one bit little * a * bit i should feel just as terrible about it as you do if i were in your place its all different with pickett and me you see we dont mind why do you know child we have slept under the same * fought under the same flag * out of the same

went up for my noble hero soldier as the little steamer * in the lines and * away and more names were added to the list of yankees for baby not to hate my soldier did not like to fight his battles over he said that the memories they * were too sacred and * for * the faces of the dead and dying soldiers on the field of battle were never forgotten the sorrow of * and * * all the glory for him in the presence of memory he was silent the * sorrow like the greatest joy is * we are both too worn and weary now for * else but to rest and comfort each other he said we will * out of our lives everything but its * from * defeat and mourning shall spring * for the past strength for the present courage for the future now that in * to the command of general lee i have finished and sent off the report of the last fight of the old division the closing days of our dear lost cause we will put up the pen for * and lay aside our war thoughts we will rest and plan for peace and after a time we

utterly desolate i stepped on board the baltimore steamer and was * into the * by a porter whose manner showed that he was perfectly * of my * and * in the midst of my * and the consciousness of my * and my real * sympathy for myself * my * * for poor * * whom * servant had caused to feel so young and green so little did i know of * and the * and * of * that i sent for the captain of the steamer to buy my * and * for my * and supper i had been * on leaving my home that the * * or * word from me might cause my arrest and that if it were known who i was it was more than possible that i might be held as * for my husband after consideration it had been decided that i should travel under my * name my train of thought was interrupted by the * of a bell and a loud voice * * will please walk into the * office and show their * the laws were so * that no one could leave any city in the south without a * from the military authorities my grandmother had given me her oath of allegiance which everybody in those dread days immediately after the surrender of the army was compelled to take in order to * * food or clothing of any kind or for the * of any business whatever it was a rare * that a man was found who would take this * oath for no matter how great the * might be he was * as a * if he yielded so the women who were most bitter too in their feelings were obliged to make a sacrifice of their * and principles and take this oath in order to * the suffering of their loved ones illness in the family and the * necessity for * and * left my * little grandmother no * and she found a kind of safety in the oath it had brought her relief and she wanted that i should have it with me as a * or * with * basket and baby i started into the * office and explained to the officer in charge i am very sorry sir that i have no * the steamer was about to * as i reached norfolk i came from a little village thirty miles beyond where * are not given i have an oath of allegiance if that will answer in its place the officer laughing said no never mind it is all right only * your name i remember you did come on board just as the * * but was there not another * who came on with * gentleman yes sir i replied it was my precious father and he went back home in the little * there must have been something to * * in the way i wrote my name or in my manner i * wrote out my given name and then as i began to write my last name i looked all around me * and changed the letter p to c writing * then i began to * * and write * the name in my oath of allegiance while there was nothing very false in what i did i felt * and was frightened for i had been brought up to be * * i had not been long in the * when baby became restless and * i was * awaiting the coming of the captain for whom i had sent when a man appeared he had short * hair deep heavy * eyes * and close together as if they had to be * by his big * nose to enable them to see he was * * one end of his * * and one side of his thick red lip and was making a * noise with his * as he said madam you sent for the captain of the boat i believe yes sir what do you wish i want you to be kind enough to get my * and * please i replied my father had only time to put me on board and could not make any arrangements certainly with pleasure you stop in baltimore long i dont know i replied you have been there before i suppose oh no never i have been * outside of virginia and north carolina most of my * before my marriage was in going to and from lynchburg where i was at school once i rode on horseback to the * of * which are among the highest mountains of the south you cant imagine how glorious it was to be up there so far away from the earth when i first looked down from their lofty heights the sky and the earth seemed to be touching and presently the rain began to * i could see the * glittering * but could not hear them fall i was above the clouds and the rain up in the sunshine and * the only * sound being a strange * of wings as the * and * * by suddenly the rain ceased the * * and i saw below the * mountains the * country that looked like a vast ocean in the distance the words of john randolph * in my heart with this * * of nature he with only a servant spent the night on those mighty * and in the morning as he was watching the glory of the sunrise he pointed * with his long slender hand and having no one else to whom to express his thought charged his servant never from that time to believe * who said there was no god no * marse john no * said the * servant i aint * to * i aint * to let none of marse thomas * * * * * no * of my * of de lord once too i you have relatives in baltimore said the gentleman * * me otherwise feeling that * and history were safe subjects i should have * on till i had told him all i knew yes sir i replied i am going to visit them where were you from this morning i came from a little country village about thirty miles from * in * county as i was about to * another * of * information upon him he again interrupted me i saw your father as he was leaving the steamer i was attracted to him because he made an appeal to all * asking of them protection and care for his child and * he was thus making himself known to any of us his brothers who might be * when he disappeared at the turn of the boat so you can safely * in me and i will help you in any way possible thank you i replied i know my dear dear papa is a * and that he was anxious about me but there is nothing to * i want only a * and my * and some milk for the baby i do not wish for any supper myself i am too * to eat it is * to feel blue and * with baby and all the kind friends to watch over me as you say and then god is always near yes that is true but did you lose your husband in the war no sir he was in the war though was he not yes sir a fear came into my heart that i was talking too much i did not want him to know anything concerning my husband whose rank it was especially important to keep secret i * myself with the reflection that the end * the means even though a slight * from the truth might be * and said you could not have heard of him and he was not of sufficient rank to have made an impression upon you if you had where is he now in the country and you are leaving him yes sir but just for a little while then he talked of how much the * had lost and how much they had to forgive how easy it was to bear victory and how hard to endure defeat saying that if he had been born in the south he would have been a rebel and that his * even now were with the southern people a sudden * came to me and i said i wish there had never been any rebels at all not even the first rebel george washington and now sir please i do not want to talk about the war i am very weary and * and would like to retire if you please sir will you get me my * and * i am so * very tired baby was lying asleep on my lap * by the * the man looked down on him for a moment and then said of course i will get them for you and was going when an * officer one of my soldiers old comrades and friends came up and cordially extending his hand greeted me how do you do mrs pickett where is the general what are you doing here and where are you going he himself was returning to his home in the far south but had been called back to baltimore on business thank you general i replied my husband has gone to * and i am on my way to visit his aunt whom i have never seen he is to come to us after a little while could not leave * just now he is very well i thank you i am so glad to have met you he returned will see you later on and was * away on his * he saw by my manner that he had said something to * me and left with a * look he was still dressed in his old confederate gray from which the * * had all been cut in * to the order from the * office and * by plain * for several moments not a word was spoken then i looked up and said my * and * please i thought you said your name was * he of the * nose * as he held my money * in his hand i thought you said your husbands rank was not sufficient to have made an impression that in all * i had never heard of him oh that * sound of * and * and that * of a nose and those little black eyes which grew into * * as they * at me like the eyes of a * did i say that i asked and with a face all * and truth i looked straight into those eyes and told without * without a * in my voice the first * * i had ever told did i say so well my friends think that my mind has been * by the way the war has ended and they are sending me from home to new scenes and * to * me with the hope of making me well and strong again * was my * name but i do not know how i happened to say that my husbands rank was low for i was so proud of it i could not have been thinking will you please be so good as to get my * i am so tired i dont know what i am saying he went away and the * * were brought to me by a * who * the door for me and i went in too frightened now to think of supper too frightened to sleep and * if in my * i had hurt my husband and what would * if i had all night long the noise of the * was to me the sound of the * * all night long it rose and fell through * of * hearts blood of * men of devoted women of innocent little children near morning i fell asleep and * that it was i who had destroyed all the world of people whose * * around me with a * roar and that i was destined to an * of * when i * the boat had * * * i went to the door and found that it was locked on the outside as the * did not answer my repeated call i * to a * passing my window and asked him to tell her that i was locked in and wished that she would come and let me out when she came she told me that she was not permitted to open the door i asked if we were not at baltimore and an officer who was with the maid answered that we were but that i was to be * until the authorities should come and either * or * me as i was supposed to be a * character on a * of paper i * master * wife and daughter in distress * in their name that you will come to her and gave it to the * asking her to take it to the captain as she * the officer said you might as well she went and while i was trying to hush the baby a voice as kind and gentle as the * face into which i looked said what can i do for you madam you sent for me no sir i replied i sent for the captain of the boat but i am glad you came you seem so kind and may help me in my trouble i am the captain of the boat he answered what can i do for you you are not the gentleman who represented himself as the captain of the boat last night sir and bought for me my * he was short and dark the gentleman interrupted me saying that the * captain was a federal * who had advised that i be * on the steamer until his return with the authorities and * i told him what the man had said about my father and the * sign the captain replied your father did make that sign and placed you in our care come i am captain of this steamer and a captain is king in his own boat where did you say you wish to go stand aside he said to the officer in charge giving me his arm he placed me and baby * and basket in a carriage and the *

get out but not until i had paid him for the time he had been * for # * street i did not know enough to go to a * store and * a * i was at my * end if i had ever had any * drive me back to the captain of the boat please i said i dont know what else to do when i went on board the captain was not yet gone which was an unusual thing he had waited to see the officers before leaving i answered the smile that came into his face in spite of his kind heart by * him the letter of my aunt who wrote a hand that was not only peculiar but * read captain and see if this is not * street the place to which my aunt has written me i must come go to # * street where my * mrs c will bring you to my house he read it might be anything else as well as * he said it looks like * but i have lived here all my life

and paid calls while my soul waited with intense * for the telegram * is better one day i had been out to * and coming home found awaiting me the message for which eyes and heart had been looking through a time that seemed almost eternal that night i took the train for new york * out all alone again baby and i i was tired and * but there was such joy in my heart as i thought of soon seeing my soldier that i did not think of my * i repeated the telegram * is better * is better over and over again i sang it as a * putting baby to sleep to the measure of the happy words * is better only for us was that sweet * when he slept i leaned back and closed my eyes and saw a world of beauty and * as the glad words went * through my heart was there ever so sweet a * since * were * to * the * * of * i went to sleep with my little one in my arms i had not money enough to get a * * enough to buy my * and pay my * through to * * at which point the telegram was * when i * later i found that a * shawl had been placed under my head i never thought about who had been so kind nor why the shawl was there all my life long * had been * of me things had been done for me * had been extended to me and i had learned to accept * as only what i had a right to expect from the human race * softly the * words * is better i turned my face over and went to sleep again on the shawl and did not * until my baby became restless we took the steamer up the * from new york to * my poor little baby was not well and i * myself for having allowed him to catch cold on the train while i was sleeping he was * and was very * he had been used to his nurse his black mammy and * her * care and attention and was tired of me * * else some * ladies on board the steamer seemed very much * and at a loss to understand why he was so unhappy with me not knowing that he was accustomed to a circle of * friends to whom he might appeal in turn nurse why do you not take the child to its mother one would say and a look of * would follow my assertion that i was its mother then why dont you quiet the child if you are and find out what is the matter with it and so on i was * and my manner must have made them think there was something wrong with me and the child for they followed me about asking * questions and making * * i was walking the * trying to quiet him all tired and worn out as i was when a gentleman came up to me on his shoulder i recognized the shawl that had been put under my head on the cars the night before he said madam excuse me but i do not think you have had any dinner and you must be worn out with * and * from * and carrying the baby wont you let me hold him while you go down and eat something even though he carried the shawl which * my faith i was afraid to trust him with so precious a * and would rather have * than have permitted my baby to go out of my sight thank you very much but i could not think of * you i said * no then he asked may i order something for you here i was hungry and was glad for the open way he had found for me and said yes * him twentyfive * it was all i could afford to pay for dinner but as i looked at the * when it was brought to me i thought how * things must be in new york for there were * and * kind of yellow * i had never seen before * i afterward learned it * with green * a bird * * * a cup of coffee and a glass of * upon his * that it would be * to the baby i let him hold little george while i * my dinner i had not known how hungry i was nor how much i was in need of * baby immediately became quiet in his arms whether it was due to the change or not i do not know but in a little while he was fast asleep i covered him up with the shawl to which the gentleman pointed finished * my * dinner taking my time and * it while he read his book and held my baby when the servant came and took away the * i arose and * the stranger for his kindness said i will take the baby now if you please if you would rather he said yes but i think he will be more comfortable with me for * then too you might * him if you moved him let me hold him while you rest here is a sweet little book if you would like to read it i think however it would be better for you to rest to sleep if you could you look really * out the book he gave me was a childs * may have been * leaves i cant remember the name but * in the book was a letter written in a childs * hand for

the while my soul * to music those * * words * is better * strength for the * trial i least * * the shadows rose to make place for one * still on the train from * my attention was attracted by a man in close conversation with the * i was evidently the subject of discussion for they would look carefully over the paper they held and then at me as if * me with something * described had i been a * * they would probably not have taken the risk of thus warning me of the fact that i was under * as my appearance would seem to indicate that if a * i was a mere * in crime they supposed they could safely take notes of me i was absolutely sure that they were talking of me and trembled with a * of coming evil i tried to turn my face to the window but my eyes were * a thousand * * passed in review before my mind though the real one never suggested itself i * to * them each in turn * that the * of the men * nothing because i seemed an object of curiosity to everybody and * my appearance i do not wonder my dress was different from that of those around me though i was * of any * in my * being * in my very best the * * in which i had been married and which had been bought and made under great difficulties and kept afterward with * care so i was perfectly well satisfied with myself i wore a long * black silk * with three * at the * while those around me were dressed in * short * * my gray * * * into * * by our * village * extended far over the face its * of pink * inside * in with my dark brown hair it was * on the outside with several * and * of * * of a * * of gray my * was about five * wide and * in front with a * * the * * worn by the world around me was * very narrow only an edge showing and small * * worn back on the head were the style the * seemed to be * with the strange man as i caught his eye just then my baby sprang forward and * a * that an old gentleman in front of me was reading and * when it was * from his grasp the old gentleman looking * in answer to my * after this * i found that the two men were gone for which i * heaven i had just settled back a little * and weak when from behind me came a touch on my shoulder and turning around i saw the strange man and the * the former said i have a * for your arrest madam and * served it upon me there on the cars all alone miles away from home and friends two dollars and ten * all my little store i was arrested * * my own child i could not read the * as it trembled in my * had never before seen or heard of one baby thought it was a compromise for the old * paper and it was with difficulty * from his little *

well said the * kindly his voice trembling thats all he wants lady you will be * probably only till the next train but i must go on i said for my husband is looking for me and i could not bear to stay away another minute longer than the time at which he * me please everybody help me my * had attracted attention and some * some were too * even to look toward me others merely glanced over their * or looked up from their books and went on reading some kept their faces carefully turned toward the * a few just as * and more * gathered around me in * curiosity one womans good heart thank god * them all she came forward her tender blue eyes * with sympathy her black * veil thrown back from her lovely face and her waving hair with the silver * all too soon among the gold and said in a voice so sweet that it might have come from the hearts of the * that she wore * at her * throat come i will stop off with you if it must be let me see the paper * with her the gentleman of the * shawl came from i dont know where and asked too to see the paper and both got off the train with me i was so weak that i could not hold my baby for all at once there came over me the sense of my utter * to prove that my child was my own there was no one to whom i could telegraph without * my * and the purpose of my journey a telegram to my friends at home would alarm them and might * me a message to my soldier would * his safety for he would surely come to me at once look look i said to the * and officers when they read aloud the * and * of the * ladies who were with me on board the * steamer and who in their * to secure a right and correct a wrong ignorant of the cause of my childs * and * with me and the reasons for my rather * * had caused my arrest thus do the pure and holy ever keep guard over the * of the world and throw the * of justice around the * to * them * into the path of * may they * the * to which their * * them look at his eyes and look at mine i exclaimed holding his little face up against my own cant you all see that it is my child that may be but give us the name of some one to whom we may * * proof if he is your own there must be some one who knows you and can * in your behalf no no i said there is no one i have nobody to help me and if god does not show you all some way and your own hearts do not * you i dont know what i shall do my poor little * * baby refused to be * the kind gentleman with the shawl could * him no longer he had dashed from him the * and pushed the watch from his ear and demanded * the right of * the dear good woman beside me with the smile of the * and a look of relief * up her face touched mine * in my ear while i held the * hands to prevent him in his * from * apart my * and * my * do you nurse your baby yes i replied and he is so hungry poor little thing she stood up leaning on her * for she was slightly * and said in a voice clear and sweet gentlemen i have a * heart almost stood * in the child who cannot speak it is not always a proof of * but with the * evidence and the youth of this mother this beyond * is proof * the child is still * from her own body and she opened my * i who had never * my baby in the presence of even my most * friends * my bosom before all those strange men and women and * him as proof that i was his mother while tears of gratitude to the sweet friend and to god * down my cheeks and dropped * * face as he * looked up trying to * up the tears with his little * fingers and * * the proof the men turned aside and tears * down more than one * face the kind stranger with the shawl lifted his eyes * as if in * and then turned them * and breathed a bitter * deep and * perhaps the * angel * down the * on the credit side of the * with as great * as he * there the prayer of thanks i trust that the * ladies when the facts were placed before them were as surely * as all these people were that i had not * my child i hope they were pleased by this * that some degree of * existed in the world outside of their own * hearts * dont know take thy * poor mother * under thy trembling wings back to its * and the father birds care i shall go a few miles further where i stop to see my baby said my new friend this little boy who brought me back to life is older than yours he is the child of my only son whose young life * out on the battlefield of gettysburg and whose sweet spirit has joined that of his noble father my husband which in his first battle was * this baby * our * young mothers and the old mothers the cars were crowded with soldiers returning home * soldiers soldiers on * and * prisoners with pale * * faces and long * hair one from * more ragged and * than the others was * his pictures and * the horrors of his prison life and as he told of his * and * amid * of sympathy * and * were * against my people once his long * arm and hand seemed to be stretched * toward me as he drew the picture of the * lincoln whose blood * out for * we follow his * let us * * to these people against whom he * and as the cannon * the hours with solemn * * with each note * * i * back in my seat almost holding my breath as i pressed my baby to my * * heart the train stopped and the sweet new friend touched my brow with her lips leaving the kiss and a prayer put the * into my hand and was gone the cars moved on and there was a great * in my heart as i thought of my * friend so * found so * lost all this was half a century ago but one of the * yet lies in my * * with the * of a precious memory the page on which it * a man not a soldier i think for brave soldiers are * and generous always stood up in a seat opposite mine and said when i think of the horrors of * and * and look at these poor * i not only want to * the * of a just god but i want to take a hand in it myself quarter should be shown to none every man woman and child of this * southern race should be bound to their own slaves for a * length of time that they too might know the * of * their lands should be * and given to those whom they have so long and so * * as he in * * the story of the * * of the prisoners the * and darkness of their * i * to stand and * for my people and tell how they too were without * food or clothes that we had no * even except what were * through the lines and that our own poor soldiers were * and * and that all the suffering of prisoners on both sides could have been * by carrying out the terms proposed by the confederate government if i had only dared to * the veil and * the truth perhaps sympathy might have * their bitterness the flame of * * * in their * hidden as in a * might have * over the * of * a bridge of * feelings yet the memory of the woman whose son had been killed on the field of gettysburg and whose * now * and * with the years i * with such tender care * the words that were like * to my ear and heart thus the power of one pure heart * its love upon the world as an * flower * * on the * atmosphere * the * spirit and * it to * the rude * of a * world i had no * in the * * steamer and my little sick baby and its poor tired mother were very * when after the long dreary night they * the dawn of day which * them many miles nearer to their * i have forgotten the name of the place from which we took the train for * after leaving the steamer but i remember a fact of more consequence concerning * it was the wrong place on reaching the * side the * were * to the * office to have their * * and i with my * basket and baby followed my fellow * when my turn came i handed the officer my * and * which after a glance he gave back to me saying with haste and * as if it might have been the most * of matters your * has been left on the states side your * were not exchanged taking the wrong train at the wrong point put me into * later than i was expected but i * followed instructions to remain on the train which stopped over at * until i should be claimed like a general * letter every * had left the * and baby and i were alone i was waiting and watching * for my * when my hungry eyes caught sight of three gentlemen coming straight toward me it was with but a * interest that i regarded them for i had * * as to the appearance of the one who should * * rights over me and none of these * seemed at first glance * to * to those * the face of one seemed rather familiar but i was not sure so i drew my little baby closer to me and looked the other way i felt them coming and felt them stop by my side what will you have of me i asked there were tears in the eyes of the gentleman whose face had seemed familiar and the next minute baby and i were in his great strong arms and his tender voice was * asking dont you know your husband little one i was looking for my soldier as i had been used to seeing * in the dear old confederate uniform and with his hair long and * the beautiful hair had been * and while he was not subject to the * of * in the matter of personal strength a critical * might have * * in personal beauty an english * suit of rough brown * had * the old confederate gray the two gentlemen with him were mr * a * a brother of one of my soldiers * and mr * of baltimore a * i noticed that these gentlemen called my soldier mr * and me mrs * which made me feel somewhat strange and * i may have * that i was in a foreign country and very far north of our old home and perhaps even * names were * by political and * conditions i had expected my soldier to take us to a quiet little room in some * * but was too tired to express my surprise when we were driven in a handsome carriage to a * home with beautiful grounds * and flowers a big english butler with * opened the large * doors and a pretty girl in a cap took baby from my arms after that i remember only being * * very tired when i had rested enough to think again i was on a sofa dressed in a pretty soft * * and i heard a kind voice saying the lady is better she will be all right let her sleep * up i saw a * old gentleman and a pair of * i closed my eyes and heard the gentleman with the familiar face say such beautiful things and his voice and touch * my heart so that i kept my eyes shut and never wanted to open them again and presently the pretty girl with the cap on came in with baby in her arms dressed in a beautiful * * * * much no hungry * eat * * * * * eat * much he no hungry he eat some more * much again he smile he now no very much hungry again some more was i in the land of * and was the gentleman with the familiar face the prince of * as he was the prince of * our * * arms and cry for me as he recognized me * any such * but i was too tired to hold out my hands to him i soon felt his little face however * close against my own and felt too the touch of yet another face and heard the same voice which had made my heart * with * * again more things like * those other things it had whispered but i was too tired and too happy to speak and my * seemed too sacred to open my eyes upon so i kept them closed when the old english physician came in the next day he said ah * ah * the lady is most well keep on * her and sleeping her she is * poor lady and * too by * ah * ah * poor lady that will * her and sleep her * her and sleep her ah * ah * thats all when the old doctor was gone i remember listening for the * of the * * the ah * ah * with the tramp tramp * as i asked the question brought back the memory that the war was over the guns were * the camp was broken and my soldier of the sweet face was all my very own i looked around * and up into the familiar face for answer and he my soldier a general no longer explained our pleasant * his old friends mr and mrs james * he said had been suddenly * to england and had prayed him as a great favor to them to be their guest until their return as otherwise the delay to make the necessary arrangements for their going would prevent their * the first steamer thus we had a beautiful home in which to rest to grow well and strong to forget all that could be forgotten of the past and to enjoy the present while in * we received letters telling us of the * that had come upon our people after the close of the war but the * news was of the suffering of mr davis for whole * of national * captain bright who had served on my soldiers staff wrote that through his * the surgeon in charge of * * he had been permitted to see mr davis he arrived at the * on the morning that the * had been removed from the * of the feeble old man by order of the physician because they * the life of one so ill and weak and was told by the surgeon that the only way for him to see mr davis was to accompany the surgeon on his * when he could see all the * the * among the rest the captain followed the surgeon until he came to the * chief the face of mr davis was turned from the door and the visitor stood for a moment silently * the great change in the man whom he had last seen as the president of the confederacy then he stepped forward and laid his hand on the arm of mr davis mr president he said * mr davis looked up quickly i am robert bright of general picketts staff the hand of the prisoner closed * over the one lying upon his arm he looked into my face as if a * had been performed wrote captain bright my own one of my own again said mr davis in that * voice that held a note of * always after the fall of the * * which * and * his * tones until they were * into the perfect * of the greater life in his * he had so * for some one who had belonged to * one who had taken part with him in that * tragic * for which the south had given her blood and * his heart leaped up to meet the sympathy of the tender * voice the surgeon came up to make his morning examination at sight of him the light in the sad face died away and the look of helpless suffering returned having finished his work the surgeon said come captain and is this all asked mr davis as his visitor passed on and again * touched his arm i would have given my whole fortune wrote the captain who had just succeeded to an * of considerable value to have stayed there in his place and let him go free there is not one of us in all the south not a soldier of us who would not gladly take his place and save him from * and suffering said my soldier looking up from the letter captain bright * with his * to let him make another visit and stay long enough to speak some word of cheer to his * chief i do not think that i can said the surgeon the risk to us all would be too great i do not see any risk was the reply the whole place is * neither that poor old feeble man nor i could possibly get away as the surgeon really wished to serve his * not only in return for past * but to be * as a host after reflection he said tomorrow when i make my * i will try to * to leave you there till i return the next day the captain went into the * and the surgeon closing the door turned to the * and said guard that door well and see that it is not opened until i come back that man in there is my * but we must not trust him too far having thus secured for the * an * interview with mr davis the surgeon continued on his way mr davis i have only a few moments before the doctor * his round can i do anything for * tell me quick no there is nothing my young * but i thank you for the wish the captain took from his pocket a * and * saying write on the * of these * any * or letters you may want to send and i will see that they reach their * mr davis replied i cannot do that no you would be * your life i have * my life before and now would risk my soul for you but there is no danger mr president mr davis wrote * on three of the * one to senator wall of new * one to a friend in pennsylvania a third to another friend whose name i have forgotten you can write to mrs davis that you have seen me take my love to all my friends i leave them in gods care this means to me more than all the * * one * of one who says mr * comes to me and * all that i have tried to do for my people just as the * was returned to its place the surgeon came in looking at him * seeing nothing and knowing that there was no pen * or paper in the room he went out followed by the visitor early next day captain bright left for williamsburg when he and the surgeon were on the * some soldiers came forward * commanded the captain what does this mean asked the surgeon we are ordered to search this gentleman was the explanation this gentleman is my * and my guest said the surgeon after * with the officers the * was relieved by the * of the order and captain bright * with the precious * in his pocket the feeling of fear he wrote came to me for the first time in all my life not for myself but for that beloved old man who is dear now to us all mr davis had not lived through those terrible four years without making enemies who in such a position could but when he was made to suffer for the * of the whole nation every southern heart went out in love to him * of past * all personal * all political * were forgotten and the people were united in a loving sympathy with the * feeble * old man as they never could have been by any * or * which he might have * upon them had he won not only the object for which he had given his life but the gold and * of a * a * later when the people of the south met in richmond to * a * to jefferson davis they did not hold first in their hearts the memory of the * the * the * gentleman the president of the confederacy above all the pictures that came * before them as they recalled the life history of the man in whose honor they had met was that scene in the gloomy * and that bowed and feeble old man with the * of the * upon him in whose sad eyes the light of love shone as he reached out to * a * of his own people and said * my own one of my own the first week in june the french maid came to our room with a telegram for mr * * that mr and mrs * would * for home the following week we began to hunt for a place to live beginning with the * and larger * and * with the * ones after a week of * and some very * * we decided at last upon one house * because of its * court * by pleasant * with its * * and pretty * and flowers how nice for our baby i said how cool and * are the sound of the water and the * of green so for * sake the * was made and our rooms engaged our * was a very dark * and * herself upon being a french * but that man of mine she * said is a * * and you would hardly believe it possible he could be the father of our two beautiful daughters both of them are going to do well but they dont take after their * the * is engaged to be married to a * with nine * by the nine * and * i gathered from her explanation which she * in answer to my * look that the fortunate * was a yankee living in a small town in the state of * and * a little country store where * and cotton * * and * * * * * * and so forth were sold the * of the department store in her admiration of him after each * business she * the to her * title of * the second daughter she told me was * to sing she has a sweet voice but she dont take after her * she said and the young * * in the next room to the right of the one you have chosen is very much taken with her and it looks like * get both girls off my hands before long she said she could not give me the use of the * when the girls wanted them the * comes a long ways you know and has to have it all to himself when he is here she * suggested that if none of them were * the parlor at the time when my company came she would let me * my visitors in it at the * of a * a dozen which * i considered a very good one for me as i did not expect to have more than a * worth of visitors in six months our * were to be served in our own room except on * when we would * in the public diningroom and do our own waiting like the others we did not exactly understand what that meant but one days experience proved it to be anything but comfortable the dinner had all been * on saturday and was cut up and * on the table in the * of the room and we served ourselves i could not help thinking of the time when my soldier had been served by * and * each anxious to be the first to * his wishes and all feeling * * for every effort by a pleasant word or an * smile i wondered how any one of those * * would feel to see us now the following * was about the * dinner with the * of course that on * it was warm * * * * * * * * * * and milk our breakfast was always cold the first one was cold bread * a * * which is the same as our * and * coffee and * our rooms had one * we were * every morning by the young lady who made love to the bird of her * * while she arranged his room dear * * * a * * a * * * * to * a sound as of the door opening a * and a * oh dear and then good morning was followed by the * excuse for not having finished * up the room and * before he came because * and i are such * we * time * so * it * i would know she was being * though i could hear only the sounds of his deep low tones between the * * of course neither my husband nor i meant to listen to these * * of course and i always put my fingers in his ears at the sound of them after our breakfast was over and baby had been made comfortable i usually sent him out for his walk with * * his new nurse who was delighted at having him all to herself * and ill not be having the * of so many others whose * i dont be * for the * god save him was * being that kissed his dinner * * with him at all at all there was the * and * wife and john and the * and that * french * * a bit am i to be * of her the vain * would be all * * him until * be that sick his milk would * in him and for the * of me i * be * the clothes * on him with all their * and * and its glad that i am entirely the * save us having him to * the * child the rooms were comfortable and we found the long * where we spent our * and most of our * not only a very pleasant change but a * of * as well my curiosity was greatly excited concerning our * on the left i was * how many there were of them though i put them down in my mind as not less than half a dozen the first morning these * as i called them were as silent as the grave till about noon when all at once without any * * they began a most * conversation * with laughter * and * the tones of their voices would change from * to * and then to grief so that at one time i was so full of sympathy with the poor man who was being driven out into the cold world that it was all i could do to * from going in and * for him but while i was * the trouble ceased i supposed he was gone and all was over with him and * offered up a * only help i could give imagine if you can my surprise when the next morning at a little later hour i heard a * of the same painful scene the poor man had returned i * taking them all together i thought they certainly were a most peculiar family and i determined to * my husbands interest when he returned something had prevented my telling him the day before that evening as we were sitting on the * i carried my resolution into effect and though he listened with his usual sweet patience my description of the * to my surprise excited in him more * than sympathy just as i had finished telling my story our baby was brought in to be enjoyed and put to sleep the little * went to * the * ran up the * the * was * to * cross and after * * baby was ready and so were we for his * baby * when his sweet little * * ours grew * and * we began to sing in the * * the * prayer which my husband had taught the indians on the * coast and which we always sang at the last to make * sleep sound at the words * * * * * * * * thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven from through the open door of the room to our left a voice clear and sweet joined in the same * with ours to our father and as the last * was * * * * * * * * send away from us all * a handsome stranger stepped out and with * hand said to my soldier with great * * * * * how do you do friend give me your good hand then followed a conversation between them about the * coast fort * * * island * sound the * * and their many * friends of the * * all the while i was * what could have become of the other * they had * yet now and then i caught a tone in our visitors voice as he talked to my soldier that * very similar to the tones of the man in trouble belonging to them though i did not see how it would be possible for any one to drive or wish to drive him out of ones home when after * i came in for the * of the season my astonishment knew no * when i learned that he had been the sole * of that room since sunday night the * in the court struck seven rising hastily and with many * this * man wrote something on his * and * it to my husband said i am playing at the * here * and see me and was gone to this kind stranger william * i was * for my first taste of the * of the * almost every evening he joined us on the * shared our play with baby * and entertained the general and kindly took us afterward to see the play yet during the whole of his * * never once in the most * way * himself upon our confidence and though he knew there was some * in his * * he made no * to it on saturday evening when his engagement was over and he came to say goodbye after * over the pleasant * we had passed together and putting great * upon the benefit they had been to him he stopped * saying * it all forgive me if i put my foot in * here is something to buy a * for the * i * i absolutely have no use for it in fact i never had so much money at one time before in my whole life and it * by rights to the young * for if it had not been for the * in the * the * * over the moon getting the poor dog a * and our father who art in heaven i should have spent every red cent of it on the fellows * * he said as my husband refused i know you have had more money than you seem to be * with now take this though we were both very much touched by the kind * of this stranger in a strange land my soldier was firm in his * well goodbye and good * to you he said you are as obstinate as an * on the banks of the * here it goes putting the fifty dollars back into his pocket and turning to me with a tone i so well remembered he wished me happiness goodbye i said may our father who art in heaven and his little ones of whom he says suffer to come * me keep your heart * for others and gentle and kind all through this life believe in soul and be very sure of god in all the years that came afterward the friendship formed then between my husband and our first * was never * to me it was a * the following week i noticed his rooms were taken by a lady and gentleman whose * were very strange i saw there were two of them this time the second evening as i was putting baby who was * restless and * and would not be * or * to sleep the * lady with a * tone and manner came in and said the * ill or * it need the * * whether the child needed the * * or mrs * * * he stopped crying at once and while she talked on he never took his startled eyes from her face till he * closed them * to sleep * * a * that * * * she asked after i had put the baby in his little bed yes madam i answered one whose love makes her so it is well she said and if * * not fear to leave the watch with her * * and thy husband come as our guests to see our * as we have * him to be it was the first of * * i had ever seen and my blood ran cold as i * watched the * of it by these the most celebrated * of their day charles * and his wife * tree with * so * that i cried over the tragedy as if my heart would break and laughed with equal * over * the * which followed at the close of the play the * brought her husband into the box and introduced him * her he did all his acting on the stage she * her * and said what no * we accepted their kind invitation to share their carriage back to the house and enjoyed too some of the * supper prepared for them it was their last year on the stage and i never saw them again though i * their little * given me in exchange for one not half so pretty and * remember the pleasure they put into our lives during the days they were our * among others there came in time that king of * noble in mind as he was perfect in art joe jefferson this pleasant acquaintance did not end with our * experience the next time we saw joe jefferson he gave a * in richmond and turned over the whole * to a * confederate who had * him in early days all in such a quiet manner as to * the spirit of the * * * the right and left hands the kindness which was shown by the * * * favorite of * the poor * in the beginning of that career the * of which even then could be * was thus * * a thousand times by the successful * our * made a * of * of all the rooms every * but to us she made her visits longer each time showing a growing interest in our affairs she could not * the * of our having come from such a * home to her * then too one of my * visitors * to be the * and another an english officer they were also a cause of wonder she was so * in this * curiosity that we were compelled to seek a larger house where we should be more lost to sight especially as just at this time two prominent southern gentlemen mr * * and mr * * had been * and taken through the lines though their * was immediately demanded by the english government much to my husbands relief i * to * the * task of * her which notice she seemed * to have anticipated and determined to * by telling of her * all of which she laid at her husbands door he is got so * now she said he * to * all the * at * the top floor ones till morning wants to set

of our going on that johnson and though i assured her that he had nothing whatever to do with it * you cant * us you cant * * * every * out of the house our next rooms opened on the * de * the * of which in part made up for the loss of the * but not for that of our * who had made * in our lives come look at the soldiers i said as i saw a shadow in the generals smile and heard a sigh when the music almost under our very windows * the hour for * the * * of despair * with my * as we stood at the window and watched the soldiers keeping time with them to step and * * while * the * sound within each playing we were * it without one * thought of the * past trying to * each other till we really * ourselves it was with * that i saw my soldier watch with * interest the * of the troops day after day and * welcome * and * our baby learned to march almost before he walked while we were * our * * and each other spite of * * for the future and grief for the past my husband became very ill in the * of his illness when he required all my attention our baby was seized with * the kind old * * by my good friends was very * but failed to * me with my * faith the chief reason i think must have been that he was not called doctor but * for two weeks he came once and sometimes twice a day going first to see and bring me news of the baby who had been kindly taken by our friends to their home to be * for i was a * of * * an * * to the english doctor though we were very good friends during all this long illness i never once stopped to consider the cost of anything whether it were food * or * of any kind if * or suggested but * * of * when the danger was past and our board bill was sent up i * over our little store and found there was not enough left to meet it my husband was still too ill to be * or troubled about anything and with the bill hidden away in my pocket i was making a plan of battle and * how i could fight my way out of the * when he noticed that i was looking pale and suggested that i go out for a little fresh air eagerly taking advantage of the excuse thus offered i put on my * and went down to the office and took from my box in the safe an * set of * and asking the * to direct me to the most * * and to send some one to sit with my husband until my return went out i had had very little experience in * of * and none whatever in * to them but i * great wisdom and dignity as i told the young man who stepped forward to wait upon me that my business was with the head of the firm he took me back to an * office where an old man with * hair and a very * countenance was looking * through something which very much * a * * into his right eye at some * lying on a * before him he wore his teeth on the outside of his mouth and his upper lip was so drawn in the * of his look as to be almost hidden under his * nose his face too was * up into a thousand * in his * upon his work we dont * young women ere he said looking up and * as he suddenly became aware of my presence i came i explained taking out my * and * them to him to ask you if you would not please sir kindly buy some of these * from me or at least advance me some money on them this is not a * * * * he replied as he carefully * the * and then suddenly * the * out of his eye turned both of the * little gray * upon me and said where did you get these * from miss i was born with them sir i said * either from my appearance or for some other cause he became suddenly * and not only would not * them of me but refused to let me have them till i could prove my right to them i was too young and * to be anything but furious and the bitter * tears that * sometimes * to relieve poor womans * feelings were still falling fast when i reached the hotel with the * whom the * had sent back with me that i might prove by the * my * of the * with which i was born he in his sympathy shared my * and after * his * regret that i should have been * to such an * advised as he * the case from the * with a * look of * * into more * language that i should look carefully over them to be sure that neither this * nor his master had * any of the * for his experience had been that * was born of * as he again locked up my * in his safe he kindly asked how much money i needed and begged that in the future i would permit him to advance for me if i should need any and * as to the board and * here he said mr * and i will * all that when he is * well my friends would have been glad to advance me the money but i did not wish to trouble them through the * of god and the skill of my kind physician my loved ones were spared to me and one day some time after they were well as i was reading the paper to my husband i * across an * for a * of * in miss * school the professor was going abroad and wanted some one to take his place during his absence the * of delight which i * gave as i read it * from my soldier the remark that i was keeping something very good all to myself i * determined that this little * should be * and that i would make an application at once for the position then if i should fail i alone would suffer from the disappointment so just as soon as i could * it i * my best clothes assumed a most * * went to the number * and asked for the professor i was shown into the * of * kind of room one * so utterly alone in without even the * of a spirit around to keep your own spirit company each piece of furniture was placed with * * and all was * the * who came in * to my call seemed put up in much the same order she was tall and * and her * hair was arranged in three large * like * i thought on each side of her long thin face high * * nose and eyes crowded up together under * * as she held my * in her hand and looked at me with a * gaze * my * thoughts and with that * * expression i felt all my courage going my * aroused me from my * and i said as bravely as i could i have had the good fortune to read your * madam in the paper this morning and have come in answer to it may i see the professor looking * at my * and then over her * at me she said the * was for a * not for a * i am perfectly aware of that i answered and came in * to offer the professor my services as a * a most * expression * up the * of her mouth and * across her little * eyes as she said i will send the professor down to you looking over her * again as if for a * of her first impression of me she left the room returning after a little while she said the professor requested me to ask if you would be so good as to come up into the * room i saw as soon as i had entered that a description of me had * my coming and not a very * one either i * from the faces of the professor and the * the class consisted of * young ladies all of them apparently older than i was the professor finished the sentence he was * on the board * it out * his hands on the * * it came forward and was * presented by miss * who remained in the room he had a pleasant round * face a * head and large gray eyes was short and * with a * * voice and manner miss * tells me you came in reply to my * i have been forced to * in order to save time as my going abroad is unexpected and * no delay i am very glad you had no * but to * else it might not have been my good fortune to know of and * to your wants sir and you have really come to * for the position he asked i have sir the expression on miss * face the * and * * among the * which this answer brought forth was not * to * my * have you had any experience in * no sir i said may i ask where you were * i was * at lynchburg college is that in england oh no sir said i with astonishment at his * and then * myself just as i was about to * him that lynchburg was the fifth town in * in virginia was on the south bank of the james river one hundred and * miles from the capital of the state and within view of the blue ridge mountains and * of * i stopped short * by my * the professor taking no notice of my confusion went on to say and so you were * there my class here has just finished * do you remember how * * yes sir i said and repeated * * * * in * * you have the * * i see he gave me several * to * then an * from * and some * from * and * by this time the * were silent and miss * expression was changed he then asked me to write and * a sentence which i did saying * * as he took the * from me that was a catch question please * and * this said he without * my aside and he wrote in * the late president of the united states said nobody is hurt before he wrote any further instead of * i looked up at him and said but oh sir somebody was hurt quickly he * the board put down the * * his hands turned his face to me and offering his hand said not to my surprise because i had faith in prayer but rather to that of miss * and the young ladies i will * you mrs * and will be * for you we went down to the parlor and i gave him the names of the only friends i had in * of whom he could make * * me the next day i gave my first * to the class i became very fond of them all and after my * of the first few days got along very well with them my soldier was curious to know where i went every day but knowing it gave me great pleasure to be thus * * me and asked no questions my first months * was spent in part * on an * for him and only our father and the * know what joy filled my heart that with the work of my hands i could give him comfort then my secret was out i was sorry when the cold weather came the * not only put an end to the military * but covered up the beautiful green there were very few * for us but i was just as happy as it was possible for me to be indeed those were the very * days of my whole life and i was almost sorry when general * * wrote to my soldier * a kind personal letter from general grant together with the following official assurance of his safety general grant also wrote that it had not been at all necessary for us to go away in the first place and that the terms of his * should have been * even though it had * another declaration of war we stopped in new york en route to virginia * to remain there only three or four days but we found that our board had been paid in advance for two weeks that a carriage had been put at our service for that length of time and that in our box was a * of * marked paid to this day i do not know how many * guests we were for a great many of my soldiers old army friends were there at the time and they all * with each other in making us happy as soon as we could make our plans we returned to our * home on * island by the james river where we built a small cottage in the place of the * mansion which had been burned by butler the * trees had all been cut even the * in the family cemetery had been broken but it was home and we loved it the river and the woods and our own garden * our table we * * to wind * around the melancholy * of the old * and * which had fallen * of the * of war in our own flowers my soldier found the * that he loved he gathered

give the world assurance of a man soon after the surrender the * of * offered my soldier the position of general in his army which he declined after he had refused a second invitation the * * to mr * asking if there was any way of * general pickett to accept the commission my soldier replied i fight only for my country nothing would * me to enter a foreign war he tried to turn his sword into a * but he was not * with * and worse he constantly received * for * from old comrades no more * than he all were made welcome though they might not be able to * a * from a * * or know whether * grew on

dinner was ready then they would * at table telling war stories until it was * decided to be too late for any more work that day there were generals * * * * * all of one rank now and he who desired a * history of the four years war needed only to listen to the conversation of the * army at * island the * soon came resources were exhausted and * and guests were forced to seek other fields one of our friends was a * who had lost an eye in the mexican war and had served in the confederate army all that was left of his * was his pride which had grown strong and * on misfortune it was difficult to do anything for him he would never admit his needs and any reference * was * to give * he had visited us for a time and when urged to stay had * declined my soldier was very anxious to help him but fearful of * him walking down with him to take the steamer to richmond my soldier * took a * gold piece from his pocket and dropped it in the road hoping that the old major would find it but the * walked by without seeing it so his friend was compelled to find it himself three times the * was played and at last the major saw the * and * it up offered it to his companion no it * to you said the general you must have dropped it urged the major i was the * how could i have a gold piece the yankees are about the only people who have been down in this country with gold and now that you have found it it * to you after a long discussion the major was induced to accept the law that * is * and he put the gold in his pocket when a number of his * wished to make my soldier governor he said that he never again would hold any office but he would be glad to have the * of his soldiers at gettysburg recognized and he and the men would like to see his old * * * governor general * was the only one of picketts * who came out of the battle of gettysburg and he was * for life he was * governor and as he was a * my soldier and i often * at his * at a dinner given by the governor to george * * the english * mr * asked general pickett whom do you regard as the hero of the battle of gettysburg on the northern side mr * was the reply the hero of gettysburg on both the northern and southern side was the private soldier i had often heard him say that not the generals but the men in the ranks fought the battles this * me of a story which i told them at a dinner in * given to general * * who had married an english officer the conversation turned upon the battle of gettysburg and my soldier was asked by the * and general magruder if he would tell them now that the war was over whom he considered * for the loss of the battle who was to * with a * in his eye he replied well * and general magruder i think the yankees had a little something to do with it among the visitors at our home at * island was mr r m t * i well remember his grave but * face * marked with deep lines * by years of study and care those who do not recall him may look at the * face of former senator john w * of virginia and gain an idea of his appearance his long hair almost touching his shoulders gave him an air that would seem * to one accustomed to the closely * heads of the present day his * acquaintance with public life formed in the congress of the united states and that of the confederacy had secured for him an * * of * which his ready * * to good effect and his * of * made him always a welcome companion his ability to deal with * subjects is indicated by the remark of senator wigfall i dont know what we southern men would do without * he is the only one among us who knows anything about * as a child his * and * for books led his old mammy to say * marse robert * * be a * man * so * in his ways mr * knew men and was the first to discover the genius of stonewall jackson in a letter written to my soldier near the beginning of the war he * the south on the possession of so great a military man as general jackson he was one of those whom mr lincoln wished to see in richmond after the surrender * confidence in his * and his influence with the southern people a meeting which was prevented by the absence of mr * from richmond at the time and for which there was no later opportunity because of the tragic end of the presidents great life some of the northern officers who had seen little if any of southern plantation life visited us and were deeply interested in the * features of our domestic circle they found much * in the original * of the negroes * to ask them questions and * with them subjects of * life general * saw an old negro coming in with a large number of * what a lot of * and what immense ones uncle tom how much do you get for them and where do you * them * * * is * case * fresh water * * water ones is * i * * en above a * * * * * * en i * * up in

with my soldier his brother * and their sister in a boat * by the * i had what i thought an interesting * of the * of childish * of thought mr * had been * on the pickett plantation in the childhood of the two sons of the family who used to follow him around and * knowledge from what they looked upon as * * of * and experience they were * * and my soldier looked at the catch in the * of the boat mr * why is it that these * are of such different * he asked with a * of the * * of mental * they come from the same water are grown in the same conditions and seem in every way alike except that the

wondered about it and this is the first time i ever understood it after all the years and the * and the foreign travel and the * he had * gone back to the blind confidence of childhood * * island was the plantation of colonel william * * * * neck general * and some other officers of the united states army among them colonel day drove down from richmond visiting old * and * * and * and were guests at * neck at the invitation of my soldier they came to our home colonel day had never before seen my soldier and he afterward thus expressed his feeling upon first meeting the * whom he had * known only by reputation imagine my surprise when instead of the * * * whom i expected to see in the hero of the greatest charge in modern history i touched * of * with the gentle george pickett i was impressed above all with his quiet * his * * and * i stood in * wonder trying to * the man before me with my * idea of the great * it might all be * up in the explanation that the * are the * not long after general grant became president he sent an order to my soldier and mrs grant extended an invitation to me and our little ones to visit them at the white house the southern train usually late was on time for once and we came out of the station just as the presidents carriage appeared * pickett he called out up to your old war * coming in ahead of the train the president referred to an incident of the war my soldier * to go from * junction to richmond applied to general lee for a pass at that time the cars were so crowded that travel by * was not permitted except on official business or by special permission general lee just * the train from richmond on military duty referred him to the * as there was not time to visit the * and be in richmond at the desired hour my soldier mounted his horse lucy and rode into the city waiting at the station to * general lee as he stepped from the train my first view of washington was from the presidents carriage though it could scarcely be called a view of the city as the carriage contained all my world and my attention was more particularly * * we were received with warm * by mrs grant who proved to be a charming * and all went well until night came when i was so afraid my baby would cry that i could hardly sleep the next day when my soldier spoke of my * the president putting his hat on the boys head and his * between his * said there ride your horse and tell them * cry as much as you please that you own this house one evening when we were * i told mrs grant of the first time i had seen her and my soldier who loved to * me repeated much to my * my * * on that occasion and the * he had used to * my * * and do you know pickett the president replied * my * that once we were * enough to think seriously of having an * performed on her dear eyes we had * the best * and had been assured that it was a very simple thing and not at all dangerous so we decided to have it done as the time grew near i got to * over it and the more i thought of it the more i did not want my * eyes changed even the least little bit from what they had always been arrangements had been made the hour for the * was almost at hand we were alone i stood watching her * the last little * and * and * my pictures and the * and putting them into her * under her shawl everything was ready and we started from the room my hand was on the * of the door when i stopped and said my dear i am very * and ought not to say this but i dont want your eyes changed they look just as they did the first time i ever saw * same eyes i looked into when i fell in love with * same that looked up into mine and told me that my love was returned i have seen that expression in them through all the years and i dont want it to be lost you might look better to other people but to me you are * as you are so if you dont mind please * keep your dear eyes just as they always have been she looked up in * surprise and replied why it was only for your sake that i was even thinking of having anything done and if you feel in that way about it * well pickett i was glad and she was glad i * the * threw the * * the floor i think and took her by the hand and we turned and walked back into the room as * as a pair of children on their first * * the * exclaimed mrs grant you just * them into a hard * then broke them and threw the * * the floor he reached over and * her hand and the president of the united states gazed upon the same eyes that had looked their love into those of the young captain in the years * and had become more precious to him with the passing of time mrs grants morning * in the blue room in which she was * by the president were very popular * because of her * good nature which had the effect of putting others in a good * with themselves and the world it may be that you have met people whose apparently * condition of mind led you to think that they were * to being put into a good * and would prefer to avoid the society of those who could effect such a revolution that is a * there is no one who does not like to be in a good * or * to experience a pleasant glow in the society of those who can * that * condition the * of mrs grants eyes compelled her to carry on her correspondence with the aid of a secretary one of the soldiers usually being sent to her aid when she desired * assistance it was before the day of the white house social secretary writing to the first lady of the land not being at that time so popular a * as it has since become the * and generous deeds of mrs grant were so quietly effected that the world never knew of the good she accomplished a friend who was very close to her said that her work ought to be made known to the public after she was gone that it might live in memory without * her * a * atmosphere * the white house due to the presidents habit of keeping his official existence and his home life separate and to the determination of mrs grant to provide him with a place where official duties might fall from his brain and pleasure and * fill his heart here he was * to mrs g as he called his * of many years here he listened to the * of his children happy that they brought to him even their * thoughts at that time * was a * at west point and the * children were * washington * colonel * did his part toward keeping the white house cheerful with the original of that smile which has since been * for * purposes general * could more easily have passed for a * than a soldier general * * face covered a * of * that was constantly * up to the surprise and delight of those who had been * by the * * of his expression the president was * by his * for keeping officers about the white house but when their * * was so slightly in evidence i could not see why * should object though general grant was the soul of * with his * friends to the public generally his * had made him known as the * or the great * if one * to appeal to the * on a subject in which he was interested he became as * as the most * of men when he was commander of the united states army a gentleman who called upon him with a letter of introduction from a friend of both tried him upon two apparently interesting subjects without leading * as the visitor was about to retire in despair it occurred to him to mention a fine horse * by their friend the great * immediately became a * of * and an * conversation followed to the delight equally of the general and his * the president told me in a * way the story of his first * of a horse speaking of his early * of military life and his horror of war i did not want to be a soldier when my father came home from town one day and surprised me with the information that i had received an appointment to west point i said i am not going he looked at me and replied i think you are then i thought so too i dont know what else i could have been i should probably not have succeeded in trade my first * was made when i was seven a * had a horse which he was willing to * for twentyfive dollars my * for that horse was so great that my father though knowing the price was too high told me that i might offer twenty dollars for it and if the * would not take that i could offer * and if that did not * i might pay the twentyfive so i went to the man and told him what my father had said it would not be difficult to * the * of the cost of that horse the boys got wind of the story and you can imagine that for * life was not worth much to me it may be that i lost money on that horse but the first * i ever * was on a * a * * the * offered a * to * who should * in riding the * once around the ring my mind was made up to win that * i promptly mounted the animal and was as promptly * upon the * asking if i might have another trial i was told that i might have as many as i wanted this time i mounted with my face toward the * * which so * him that he * * around the ring and i got the * at west point * grant took the highest * * in the history of the * one who witnessed

the head of a tall man standing within a short distance of the bar the horse paused and gathering all his strength for the mighty effort * over forty years later grant remembered the * that had served him so well and said york was a wonderful horse after the war * that his old * was poor and helpless general grant sent him a * the old soldier never claimed to have distinguished himself in * at west point but he must have made an impression of strength upon those around him for one of his * james a * said if a great * * in this country during our * * grant will be the man to meet it he had the *

to beat the president or be * by him the president with the true * * * until the lieutenant fired with like * yielded and rode to win he did win and the president was very fond of telling the story of

past had killed a number of * * a mexican officer who was a * and daring * had an ambition to mount the horse lieutenant grant * for the safety of his mexican friend would not consent to his riding so

his * of the friendship and sacrifice nor general grants look in return nor what those old soldiers * as silently * hands and walking off in different * they gazed out of separate windows and i stole away one evening just after the new york steamer had * her three * in honor of my soldier as the river * always did in passing our * and had gone around the * we saw uncle tom the faithful old negro * coming up the hill with a * over his * shoulders and talking to himself more * than usual good evening uncle tom i said * off the * to * him what have you in your * for me * what i got * you but i got a piece of my mind * marse george en * * piece of mind * not * * your * i * you better * in de house en sing some of * song * while is * a present of de piece of mind to marse george as my curiosity was greater than my fear of mental * i stayed to share with my soldier the piece of mind uncle tom proceeded to * his story to the effect that a * who had come to * hundred was * the colored people against my soldier and * with them to visit us in force he said that he was a brother of one of the same class of human * who had visited our community some time before * to the negroes * that was * to turn them into white people my soldier had reported the * * and with mr * * and colonel john * had taken to richmond some * of the * and some of the negroes to whom the * had been sold and the * had been put in * his brother was now * the * colored people with the idea that my soldier had caused the disappointment of their * * the man who thus excited uncle * * and * had * in the river with his vessel for weeks sending out his * to tell the poor * colored people that the united states government had authorized him to promise that to every colored man who would bring him a good * and saddle thereby showing his * for the possession should be given a * to fit the saddle and * and that he would receive and * for the same every night between the hours of midnight and * so successful was this * that he had almost made up his * before he was caught and there was hardly a * and saddle left in all the * country while my soldier had confidence in uncle tom he did not much believe that the negroes would dare make an attack upon him he insisted though that i should not run any risk but should take our * and go to richmond for a few days finding that no * could * me to leave him he * that we might wait together * yet not * that they would come the third night after uncle * warning when we had begun to hope that he had after all been * we heard a * at the door and then a low * thats * * on the door with his * said my soldier he * something and is warning us listen he opened the door and the dog entered trembling and with great tears of fear in his loyal eyes we listened but heard nothing my soldier came in and shut the door lay the baby down he said and take this but keep it out of sight * me a pistol his * gun was resting on a * just above the door * stood * his nose nearly touching the * of the door my heart seemed almost * from my throat and * in my ear like the * of a * the baby smiled and * aloud while we listened * there came the sound of * the * of * * and * listen they are coming around the back way and across the * of the old house i hear a number of steps but they are * steps dont be afraid dear be your own * little * i am not the least afraid i answered my teeth * and my hands trembling not the least soldier * turned his head and looked at me as if he had heard a strangers voice and then * his * to * me returned to a dead point the sounds became * and the * wave rolled nearer one who has never * a * sea of black faces filled with excitement and fury wild ignorant * some * with * cannot form the * idea of the awful sight they threatened * against my soldier saying that not satisfied with fighting against their * he was now trying to keep away those who would * them they were led by a * white man who when they reached a point where possible danger lay retired from * and withdrew to a * spot in the rear my soldier stepped out on the * and * the * who were * * and * * * and all manner of * looking at them for a few * he said boys what does all this mean what is all this trouble about you dont know what you are doing that * dog there * and * down behind you to save his own * * is not your friend for a few * of money he will lead you to * lie and kill all he wants is what he can make out of you dont trust him boys these miserable yankee * * any love for you they never * any negroes we who * you are your friends we have been brought up together and understand each other * so * * so cried uncle tom who had come up with the * as if he were one of them in spirit you better listen to marse george he * is * you de * * * * stand back stand back cried my soldier suddenly * forth and waving both hands stand back i say the negroes fell back on both sides and my soldier went down between them to where the white * was * behind his poor ignorant * black * and * him by the * shook him with all his force the * broke and the man fell to the ground my soldier * on top of him and called bring me that * * to the * stretched across the road come boys * * the * after they had * bound him the general ordered some of them to * him up and carry him to the * and * him in which they did with great satisfaction their * * having now * completely to the side of my soldier now boys said he get into your * and go back home and be * that the bad man locked up there in the * * with the * and * has not made you all * a crime too for which you would be sent to * the reference to the * * of the * was for the colored people a sufficient bar to their possible change of sentiment and return to the * of their former leader they

equally with the colored * our second child little * was three years old when * left us to marry a * * a young man who in his * * recognized no superior i was sorry to part from her particularly on account of * strong * to colored people after * * to fill her place a * noted for judgment and care in the * of her servants sent me her own nurse until i could secure one that would please me the nurse remained three days when * took the situation into his own hands and thus explained it in his prayers our father who art in heaven please send me a white nurse because nobody else can and because when black hands touch me my soul * all around inside and i get * and * things all down my back and oh dear lord our father who art in heaven * rather have no supper than have their black hands cut it up for me and * rather be * as the * than have them * me and * rather not go out doors and see the birds and flowers and other children and things play and * the * that the * dont care if we * because they grow wild than have their big * eyes watching me so our father who art in heaven please send me a white nurse quick for * sake * dont you know my darling i said that all the southern children have colored * your * had one and loved her almost like a mother god made the colored people well then there must have been a colored god around somewhere he thought that the black god must be very * and prayed that the * * might die and let the white god make all the people at that time the only servants in virginia were colored finding that the child could not become accustomed to black hands and that his health was * by his efforts to * a * that seemed * we * for a white nurse but with no success hearing us talk about * * asked god to put in a * for a white nurse for him he prayed for everything he wanted and asked the lord to do things for him that his father and mother could not do at the same time * the father in heaven not to let us know that he had * to a higher power lest our feelings be hurt we were * at the * and exchange hotel in richmond one morning as we were going out for our daily ride a beautiful woman dressed in deep mourning was standing in the hall with a startled expression she held out her hands and my little * ran into her arms * oh you are the dear good gods * and you have come to be my nurse and take my * place see our mother see black hands wont ever ever make * in me any more now that our father who art in heaven has sent the * to me the stranger clasped the child to her heart * his golden * and sweet brown eyes while her tears fell pardon this * emotion madam she said and excuse me please for taking such a liberty with your child i have just passed through a great sorrow and am very nervous i led her to our rooms where she sat with my little darling in her arms * into his face * and * my little angel oh my little angel he took out his * * and * her eyes and * her said dont cry * dont cry come and ride with our mother and my little brother and me and you can hold me in your lap come * come she rode with us sitting beside me holding my little * why do you call me * she asked * explained that hearing us talking about * for a nurse and seeing how we had failed he had sent an * to god himself asking for just the kind he wanted and he added i knew you were gods * as soon as i saw you when we returned she told me her sad story the tragic story of a beautiful fair proud woman with the one black drop in her * all her loved ones were gone her beautiful boy the last to leave her and she * for little hands to * away her pain she stayed with us and her * charge saw only the pure white face the delicate soft hands that touched him * and knew nothing of the dark * that held her in * to the past she was a devoted nurse * and * with both children but it was on * that she * all her * up love he was very fond of music and was always ready to * the dawn with a smile and a song early one morning when george first opened his eyes after a night in the better world of dreams he heard * * tones in the * of where oh where are the * children the necessity of taking up the * * * filled his little heart with * and with a sense of having been * he called out our mother please come and make * stop singing where are the * children i dont know where the * children are and i dont want to know mary the faithful answer to gods * * to find the * children and amid her * of possible places in which they might be concealed peace was restored * was one of the most * of children not only could he sing but he was quite an * with the * and at a very early age could cut out the most * * of birds and * one day after an illness i thought he had been * long enough and suggested to him to put up the * lest he become nervous and tired * went the * wait till i get the * part of the * * right he said several times i made the same suggestion receiving the same reply and * went the * then * myself i raised my voice and * called put those * down sir this minute * went the * across the other side of the room and with eyes * with * he cried out madam do you think that aunt mary christ would have spoken to her little boy * like that no my darling i said ashamed of myself and i will never never again speak in that way to you and i never did it was probably the first time that the blessed * had ever been spoken of as aunt mary christ but the claim of * was not * as put forth by a little virginia boy since in the old * * ladies or those who were regarded with special * were always addressed as aunt our * * in the hotel were colonel and mrs * the colonel had belonged to the federal army and after the war had brought his family to richmond to live his children had some * soldiers with which they and my two little boys would fight great battles the confederates and federals being permitted to win * mr davis came in one day when the star of victory shone on the southern side * boys he said i am glad i came today i like to see the confederates win wait wait said my little george and well let you see the federals win ah my little man replied mr davis in his * voice your father and i have seen the federals win * was always interested in his fathers fighting in mexico of course mr davis far * my soldier in that war but when * asked were you in * company mr davis or was he in yours rather than hold any * over his father in the boys thought mr davis replied if i remember * we were both in each others company i think my son our * said * after mr davis had gone what has mr davis got in his throat that makes his talk sound so * the * we passed at the old * white * and the * * springs the * in both places being kept by brothers who had served in my soldiers division one season we

day i found him in the rooms of mr * who with weak and trembling hands was * some * * was sitting on his knee watching his work i know what makes your hand * he was saying our mother told me she says its because of all the good things it has done for gods people your little hand does not * * you glad asked mr * * rather have * hands if they would help me to do good to all the people like yours

his office was in richmond where his * had been spent and where we had many pleasant friends and old * though living a life of deep * my soldier was fond of a story or a * he used to tell some of * * and * which in his youthful days in * he had heard from the lips of that famous * so that when i afterward saw the stories of the great war president in * i remembered many of them as old friends mr lincoln was much interested in the plantation * told by the virginia boy and they exchanged stories to the delight of both my soldier especially * a * if it was upon me on leaving home for a business trip he once asked me how much money i should need before his return after a * * i mentioned a * which he knowing me promptly * he had been gone only a day when i suddenly recalled an * that had escaped my memory and * him by next * came a * carefully made out * to mrs * * as i must have the money it was necessary for me to * it as it was made out to * me he kept the * to * before my eyes on the * * and i have it now he always made companions of our boys and * and played with them as if he were the same age as they one morning when our little george was about ten years old he took him to the office several * from home sending him back with a note telling him to go directly home and not to get into any trouble on the way then he followed him watching his progress i still have the note in which were * the little fellows * of which this is a copy saw a man * * stopped to watch him went on a short distance saw two * fighting stopped to see which beat * them on again farther along saw something interesting in a * window stood and looked started on and came to some boys playing * stopped and took a hand in the game lost all his own * paid up like a man walked on * came to a man * *

reaching home one hour and twentyfive minutes the report was sent by a * who delivered it to me before little george came into the house so that to his great surprise i was able to tell him all that he had been doing when i showed him the record he said i knew dear father was a great man and knew most everything but i * know he had gods eyes and could see everything to my * whether he had done anything else by the way which his dear father had not seen he replied yes i threw * * hat over the * and i * have been home yet if he * * me * * was with me at the time and i had an * * of the way in

and bent fingers his little brain is all * up too he cant understand how this thing should have come to him poor little man it is * to * him * his little heart in her sympathy she had assumed the * of the * child and her face and hands were * up as she had described his brain this was miss * last visit to richmond when she came as a reader having left the * stage when i first knew her she was at the height of her wonderful career as an * i met her at the house of a friend and she often visited me when in richmond she became very fond of our children and they were * by her my little * asked her what is the use of acting why dont you be * be it ah she replied there is the trouble i do be it my child there is where strength and * * just being it * was anxious to see her play but she would not let him see her as * * no * * must ever come into the life of a child like that she said of all the people i have ever known he would be the most deeply impressed by * * a friend had sent in some birds for * and he said to miss * i * brought up thinking it any wrong to * birds or any wrong to eat birds and all the good people i know * them and eat them but things that have such pretty * and such pretty talk in their * must have souls and so i dont know for sure about * them and * them not for really truly sure you know i think you are right my child about the birds having souls and i believe horses and * have souls too you know dear i believe in * we eat the body of the bird the * we put in our cap and the soul is the voice that must sing in another bird after that * did not feel so bad about the * of the birds the soul goes out and another bird * it and * * * told me how her idea of * * had come to her on the evening of the day that she had been * called upon to play the character she was standing in the wing awaiting her * book in hand when she heard one of the * say * she is no longer what she was she * in a * there came to her the * of the character in which she was to make her greatest success i never saw her lady * on the stage but * a * impression of the * * when she showed me in my own room how she had played the * scene upon her first appearance in * when she was * i still see her tragic face with the * horror * over it as she looked at the * on her hand with the sudden * of a frightened woman she * took up a * of her dress to * it off the * of the effort * upon her she removed her * from her dress and a * terror * into her face she caught up her long hanging hair and tried to * away the * with her great * eyes fixed upon her hand she uttered the words out * spot in a tone of * despair that * me with terror she did not act lady * she was lady * in all her pride all her ambition all her determination all her despair she said that she did not like to play the character because it exhausted her it is easy to understand that a woman of cold and * ambition would * the life of one so gentle and * as * * in this engagement she did not play * * but she gave us her * of the part because my soldier wanted to see it * * described it * when he said it * as if she spoke through blood she was one of the few to whom a set stage with * and music and * and an audience are not necessary in the * of * * a private room or a * * under a tree or an open space in the sunshine was all the stage she required one soul that understood her was audience enough and when she threw herself into the character she represented no one would have known whether she wore the * of a * or a queen i told her of having met * tree in * oh she said that was worth losing your name for * to the fact that in * the general and i were known by our middle name of * the very fact that she could not keep from acting when off the stage made her interesting did you ever see her * her nose i never had so to * * trees manner of * that ceremony miss * slowly and * drew her * from her pocket as she did so her eyes opened wide and * * as if some scene of tragic * were * up in the middle distance her form was * and rigid all her * drawn * as if for a fatal spring the * was lifted and applied to each * while the face was stern and * as might have been that of the noble * * his son to death for breaking the law the * was returned to her pocket in the same * manner the blood of all the * was on that * when it was put away * said * tree could not help acting it was her nature * trees * tragedy was sometimes * of * results going into * * store in richmond she asked in her most * voice have * any * * no dear madam * the gallant but startled * * sorry one of the * came to his assistance with the information that the lady meant * at the same time taking down some pieces from the * the * * them with tragic * and looked up with eyes filled with * * of emotion * in a voice of intense power * with * force upon each word said * they would * * * replied the * * i * not * * * manner was the opposite of that of * tree she was a perfect child of nature and one meeting her would have supposed that she was a gentle quiet * with no thought except to please her own speaking of joe jefferson she said i think his * are as * as his acting and the colors in his voice * as perfectly as those in his * he really must have had a dog named * when he was playing * * * and if you had told him * he would not have believed you he could * himself into thinking that whatever he * was a fact and his audience * took the same view once when * * was with us judge * then an old man came in and meeting his wife greeted her with great * * and * her hand judge * of petersburg asked how old is mrs * judge judge * replied she was * when i married her judge and to me she has been that age ever since the little incident * * of the * whom she had known in * and of the beautiful * that robert * used to pay his wife she spoke of his * when mrs * * was * with his own in a manner * to her he really felt that she was superior to himself and had no patience with people who could not appreciate her greater * miss * told me that of all the parts she had ever played she most enjoyed * which she used to play to her sisters * she was fond of * saying everything is more * than plain english in * she talked the * with the * so well that she might have passed for one of them she was equally at home with * * and * * and when in the north had been noted for * in negro speech which she thought the most beautiful of all but on coming to richmond she found that she did not know anything about the * of the * being anxious to learn it she used to talk with old * and * two * characters at the * and exchange hotel * their * over and over later she would try to say them finding that she was no more * than in the beginning thus she learned that to know plantation talk one must be born to it it cannot be * she was at that time victim to a painful and * * seeing her suffering one day from the * for the * i said oh i am so sorry you cant play tonight yes my dear she replied gently i shall play tonight and it may be all the better for the pain watching her wonderful * that evening i thought it might be that pain is the * to the highest * of art the last time i

of our friends from the * world was joe jefferson whom we saw now for the first time since meeting him in * on coming to richmond he found that his old friend mr * who had helped him to a * upon life had lost his fortune by the war and was in even greater need than the unknown boy had formerly been the famous * was not one to forget a kindness * give him a benefit he said to my soldier it was * of joe jefferson that he never said i will do thus and so he said * do it as if the success of the * * upon the one to whom he was talking rather than on his own ability the benefit was given and the man of * * had reason to be glad that in the days of the full * he had cast his bread upon the waters the old * and exchange hotel in richmond virginia celebrated for having entertained more distinguished visitors than any other * in this country consisted of two houses on opposite sides of the street connected by one of the most * bridges where the guests found a pleasant meeting place as they passed from one building to the other colonel * the * was a * gallant and * old virginia gentleman a * of * * to no * of position as was * in his reception of the prince of * on his visit to richmond after cordially * hands with the royal visitor he * him on the back and said make yourself at home prince make yourself at home sir i * to you my * welcome sir old * will look after you and if i can be of any service prince just call on me i never heard whether the prince returned the * * but i know that he accepted the * in the same spirit in which it was offered he visited the * * and * the * of his fine * drove with him behind his * * and so * the old virginia * * which he * with his host that he asked for and received the * for making them and took it back with him to the * with some * * to * in his * garden the colonel was our * friend and devoted to our children who while they returned his affection stood in * of him from the time that he gave them a * * by * his * * and turning his * wrong side out of what had happened to * * * * on our return from * * springs the summer our little * was in his * year as we drove up to the exchange hotel the dear old colonel came out to the carriage and said your rooms are all ready general we received your telegram and prepared for your coming but we have two cases of * here so i have arranged to have you taken care of at the * hotel till the danger is over we thought it best not to run any risk and went to the * the rooms were large and comfortable dr and mrs * were the first to * us they too with several others of our friends who had little children had been obliged to leave the exchange for the same reason our * proved in vain for my sister a young lady just * society who was * with us was * with the * and my * brother and my two children caught the * at the end of three months however all were well except our beautiful * wonderful boy our little * always a delicate child who now became * day by day there was never anything like the * of the people of richmond in those trying months relatives friends and strangers came daily with * books good things * as long as we could take our darling to ride for his beautiful angel face his wonderful mind and his glorious voice had won a place in every heart while * was ill mr davis called on us for the last time as he was never again in richmond when he came in i drew up a chair for him but he said may i not sit on the bed beside our sick boy when * * was brought in he asked that * be brought for mr davis to which mr davis added his voice shall i say grace mr davis or will you asked the child you if you please mr davis replied for i should like to hear your grace closing his beautiful eyes * said the grace his father had taught him * and never mind * about mr davis being here for he would like to have you i do not think that the child took his eyes from mr * face except to say grace during the whole time the visitor was there oh but that face was so * so * changed every expression the sound of his voice the look in his eyes all * a broken heart only the * of motion and the * of tone remained on good * night seven months afterward in * tones one and then another of my friends as they left me for the night whispered resignation to the will of god our * was dying all through the long weary night my soldier mary and i * watched and listened beside him as we were moving softly about the room he said * not asleep our * * thought i was * cause i was laughing but i * i was laughing about the * thoughts i had when i was young i just * make my eyes open wide and when she caught me laughing i could see the first time i found out that god was ahead it was that time in the * when i wanted you to turn on the snow and * said you * do it and * any of you do it neither our * nor our papa nor thomas could turn on the snow you said you could all of you turn on the water well i * see why you * just as well turn on the snow as the water then all of a sudden the thought came into my head that god was ahead of you all and that only he could turn on the * flying * snow and i began * what more he could do that nobody else not even our * and our papa could do do you remember how thomas laughed at me the next day when i told him about it how * i was when i was young * i i * all the little children are just as * though and all of them think there * anything in the world that their father and mother cant do i know i thought so until that very morning and then i knew that god was ahead even of them once i asked our papa which was the * he or god and oh my but i was so hurt and disappointed when he said god was the * little * of light were just beginning to * in through the * * my soldier smiling stooped and kissed our * little * hands and said yes my boy god is ahead and then he walked over to the double windows and opened wide the * so that all the * might stream in * and light the room that our little one could see the eastern sky and watch for the sun he loved so well the sky became a * red and moving across it was a black * cloud what are those dark * soldier are they * i asked as i walked through the window * the * to take a better look at the long * line and to * in the morning air no little one replied my soldier they are wild * the cold weather is all gone then summer has come our papa said the child i was watching those little moving black * too when our * asked you what they were a * of voices from below * upon our ears some unfortunate fellow has been * and is in the hands of the * explained my soldier the * of our watch the * of the hour and the * silence of the deserted streets made the * voices seem more * i looked over the * oh what a * sight i exclaimed the poor man looks like a gentleman too * and distinguished looking poor fellow he seems so * * sick please my darling go to his * who knows but perhaps somewhere there are belonging to him little ones like ours yes please go our papa please sir * the * tones from the bed go and bring him in he may have little ones of our kind and * he has a little one of our * kind too waiting for him somewhere my soldier went out just as the round red * of the sun burst into sight out of the east there was a greater joy than a smile on his face when he came back he had brought the stranger in and * him in the hotel as our guest our lives frequently came in touch with this strangers in the years that followed and he told me that often and again when he was attacked by that same terrible almost * * the memory of the spirit of the child in the dawn of good * had saved him a year later when my soldier went home and little * was placed beside him the children of this man came to me and said we are sorry * is taken away for we have been putting flowers on his grave every day as our papa told us but we can just as well put them here and on the generals grave too the long saturday passed and * sunday came over the hills in the * of its * and with * * rang out the blessed * that a * had * to bring heaven to the world but the golden light brought no dawn of hope to the hearts of those who watched * over the little life that was * out upon that sea of glorious music into the heaven of which it gave glad promise * to rest while the children sang their * * our boy went to join his brother * through the open window the voices were * christ is * as he turned his head and laid his face against mine and reached out his little hand to my soldier and mary i felt his spirit * and go with a * sigh for me his soul slipped through the gate that christ had * to * during his long illness * friends from everywhere had been * in kindness all their * he had * to the poor children his books he had left to his little brother his ring to mary his confederate orphan * to his father and me saying next quarter you will both be confederate * for i shall be with the soldiers in the * * ill be his little * boy so i want you both to have that money his uncle * as he called judge * * had given him a little * * * and on the saturday evening before the * dawn he asked his father to give the * to the poor handsome man who had come in the early morning when the sun was * and * and good * was getting out of the way for * weeks before he had selected his * from among his little * and had asked them all to wear white to dr * he said please sir doctor dont make the boys or any of my friends or relations cry but please sir tell them something pretty as you do at * sometimes and make them as happy as you can and have them all sing bright songs and i want everybody to bring me red and blue and yellow and pink flowers as well as white ones and when you all get through and start back home i want the boys and girls to carry all the flowers with them because the flowers would be so * out there that * * and die birds dont care for flowers and children do he often asked me dont you think flowers can feel the * * were still fresh and * in st * church when * of * little boy friends all in white singing their * * carried the little white * that held the flower just * into * in our fathers garden across the street and up the * followed by all the children of the * and the many * friends we left him under the * of the young green leaves among the * flowers of the early spring where the music of the waters of the * stream as it * over the * could be heard * with the sweet song of the birds the morning that he went to sleep george had come in with a * of white * * from general and mrs * who had taken him to their home during these last days of his little brothers perfect life in his loving haste to bring them to his brother some of the delicate white * had fallen and been crushed * looked down at the hurt leaves then up into * eyes saying little brother be gentle with the flowers they die so soon these almost his last words my soldier had * on one side of the gold * the confederate orphan money which he had * to us and wore it always on his * after he went to our boy i wore it and always have tried to obey its voice and be gentle with the flowers they die so soon my soldier * to take me away at once from the scenes where so much suffering had come to me and the next morning i * all my strength for the trial awaiting me i went to * room and found her dressed with the * of her * ready to go out her * marked and * were being taken * upon the bed were my dress and * * and veil and * of mourning all laid out by her careful hand come she said let me help you off with your * you have not much time i was just coming for you you are to leave on the * train george has gone with his father while he makes the final arrangements i have said goodbye to them goodbye mary i said goodbye what do you

i said them out from that time to him i was always dear mother from the walls of a * in france for many years came at * time a message of love a book an * flower a letter or a prayer then when all had been taken from me and i needed her most only silence came and i knew that she too had passed beyond in the early summer of # as we were on the * of going to green * white * springs for the rest that my soldier so much needed after a winter of hard work a telegram came from the * company he represented * him that an important matter in their norfolk * had * * his immediate personal attention little one he said to me you must go on to the springs with our boy and i will join you just as soon as this business is settled go without you not for the whole world i replied no indeed my soldier i

following our arrival in norfolk my soldier returned to the hotel suffering with a * the duties had proved more * than were anticipated and his illness had been * by hard work in the intense heat feeling better the next morning he insisted upon going out again but within the hour came back with another * thus began the long battle with death in which no * word escaped his lips with the * born to the brave * in long * and * * and * in the * of battle his soul rose * above the * of physical * when intense pain forced a * from his lips he would look up * and * saying you must not mind my * little one * afraid husband is getting into bad * forgive him so * was he for me that often he would not * that suffering had caused an expression of pain but would say oh it was nothing with * face he met the agony fighting a * battle than had ever been * upon a field of war oh those dark dark days when hope failed and faith * if there was one * of light in their gloom as i look back through the long weary years it was in the loving * and sympathy of his people the people of our beloved land everywhere especially do i recall among the * of those who came to serve my cousin william jasper * a mere boy in years but a man in mind and spirit who with willing hand and heart with gentle words and loyal loving eyes came to watch with me through the dark * my hands with a childs loving * and a mans strong sympathy long years afterward when i stood by the open grave of this cousin and looked upon the many * whom special trains had brought from all parts of the country to do him honor and show their love my thoughts went back to that dread time and i wondered not that a host of friends were * by his passing in vain were all our * vain our loving care the time soon came when i knew that my soldiers * was almost ended father * who had come from richmond to see him asked do you want to see me alone with his hand on the fathers knee he replied you know father i never was a solitary bird i was never alone except sometimes in the * or in the woods and then i had the spirit of my mother and my little girl with me i know you are * to death said the * ah no how could i be i think god does not want me to be * to leaving my wife and little boy alone in the world he only wants me to obey with the courage of a soldier who * an order that must be carried out because he is a soldier the father was silent for a time as if going back in memory to an hour long past then he said the first time i remember seeing you and having a talk with you was on * hill standing there alone your little boy gathering flowers some distance away you seemed completely lost in the view before you you held a * of wild flowers in your hand and were singing as i view now those scenes so charming i listened and when you had finished the song you began to * i asked you what * you * and you said i was thinking of * and of the boys and of the old fellow who came into the camp at * * and * out * * o and we all gave him money to go on his way and i sang that song that night and it came back to me and i wondered what had become of the boys the next morning at breakfast a young fellow named may came in and said boys here is your money and it is worth it i was * * o i was * where may was on the last day when the * wanted to give my soldier an * he said no i would rather suffer and know you say there is no help for me that * got to cross the river well i want to go over in my right * know when * going and i want to see how to * my little * as it * out from the shore and look into the dear faces of my loved ones till i * my last good night now please doctor excuse me but wont you all go and leave me alone with my wife you have tried to save me for her and i thank you now all that you can do for me

will watch over you and help you to * all these * what are officers asked the child * you are old enough to know * and officers you must begin to learn words because words are things and their * have much to do with our lives he spoke of * words and how the indians had chosen their words * * look out means you must not tell * it is a secret * heart * * * my heart * to yours he turned to me and said in * i am trying to make him understand the value of words and feel their meaning as indicated in their sound he gave george some money and told him to * his little friends saying that he had found that it brought him much more pleasure to give than to receive and that one of the * of the eyes that he * more than anything else was gratitude and love i have seen gratitude and love in a * eyes almost as strong as in a human * little george asked how about a * * have secret eyes they are eyes of * eyes that * you to read them they are * beautiful and there is a * that looks like them

journey i want you to come and take my precious wife to your home and keep her just as long as you can have her and as she can stay she loves music she loves the beautiful sky she loves the flowers the ocean and she loves you both lying here thinking about it i feel that if she went to her own people they would * her all the time of her grief because it will be a grief to her and it would be the same way if she went to mine with you there is nothing that will make the sorrow * when the letter was finished he said to little george my darling boy your dear mother gave you my name george *

could not speak i could only remember oh my * little * precious wife pass over the dark days as bravely as you can till our boy is safe and then come to husband his thought went out to the home in which we had spent so many happy years if i had been at home in our little room within the sight and the sound of the waters below us and the old * coming by the birds singing and my own * that always came and the * i think husband would have been a long time with you and the little boy * it is best i think they must have given me an * though i asked them not to for i feel as if * * now little one

sleeping six hours later one of the sisters of charity came in and * the precious hand which i knew was holding mine for the last time two hours earlier i had felt the sigh that * his great spirit and made of me oh the * of that word a widow darkness came through it some of the scenes that passed made pictures on my mind which come back to me now in the dim * of memory i recall the * and resolutions of sorrow that came from military * from * of trade from the many * that had known my soldier through the years from all over the country they came to tell of the deep * and honor in which he was held i remember the long * of * that followed him through the streets of richmond to the beautiful resting place of * the * funeral * they told me that had ever been known in richmond his staff officers * and headquarters guard met again to follow him as * as when he led them into the * of battle his old soldiers who had leaped at the * of his sword and dashed with him against the * of death and who were now scattered through far distant states had * to the call of the * * and the * command of their beloved leader to march behind him for the last time those who had followed other leaders came to do honor to the memory of the great soldier who had fought for the cause dear to them all a few years later another * marched down the streets of richmond to the sacred ground of * to attend the * of gettysburg * * to the memory of my soldier and his brave * first confederate * again southern veterans assembled in honor of their leader and of their gallant comrades loyal to them and the past they came from many states faithful as in the days of fire and storm bringing their * of memories to lay on that sacred * william * and joe jefferson placed their * * on the grave of their friend
