how often in the * of his great soul he has said i did not do it my men did it all i feel that he would be better pleased to know that the brave men whom he led through those four long dark years have held a high place in my thought as i have written * to the men of picketts division who yet * hands with me in the friendship that was * in blood to grow stronger through all the passing years and to the memory of those who have gone from our sight to be ever present in our hearts and on the most glorious page of our * history this volume is * * why do i write this book to add my * to the memory

a pass to go into richmond he * replied i dont know about that i have given passes to about two hundred and fifty thousand men to go there during the last two years and not one of them has got there yet some of those passes had been used and their * had arrived at last having made the * time on record since the first * bore the * * over an * * the queen city of the south had fallen the story of the great nation which had * upon the * of our * had been written out to its last * word on the morning of sunday april # in the holy calm of st * church we had assembled to ask the great father of heaven and earth to guard our loved ones and give victory to the cause so dear to us suddenly the glorious * was * by the heavy cloud of disappointment and the peace of god was broken by the * * * the * of our hopes there was mad haste to * from the * city president davis and his cabinet officers were in the church and to them the news first came they hurried to the * to secure the confederate * and retreat with them to some place of safety fear and dread fell over us all we were cut off from our friends and communication with them was impossible our soldiers might have fallen into the hands of the enemy we knew not they might have poured out their * on the battlefield we knew not in our helpless deserted condition all the world seemed to have been struck with sudden darkness the records having been secured an order was issued to general ewell to destroy the public * the one thing which could * the horrors of our position fire was added to our * general j c * our secretary of war with a * humanity and a * sense of the rights of his people tried in vain to have this order * knowing that its execution could in no way * or * the * army while it would result in the ruin of many of our own people the order was carried out with even a greater * than was intended the * * was the first fired it being regarded as a public building because it contained certain stores belonging to france and england a * * up suddenly from the south * the slowly * flames into a * and they mounted * until they * the whole great building on the wings of the south wind they were carried to the next building and the next until when the noon hour struck # the city between * and * streets and main street and the river was a * of ashes still the flames * on they leaped from house to house in mad * they stretched out great burning arms on all sides and * in deadly * the stately * which had stood in lofty * from the * days of * pride soon they became * * of fire * immense * of flame * against the wind and fell sending up * of fiery points into the air * like * stars against the dark * that shut out the sky a * sea of smoke wave upon wave * over the town here a * of * that seemed of * * there a brilliant cloud shot through and through with * of crimson fire the cruel * on and the magnificent ocean of smoke and flame rolled before it in * of destruction over the once fair and beautiful city of richmond the * * of women and children arose in agony above the * of the flames the * of falling * and the * of * feet * of furniture and * lay in the streets as if the city had struck one great * when everything was taken into the * and left there to be * to pieces or buried in the mud the government stores were thrown out to be destroyed and a * gathered around to catch the * as they ran in

to * the flames * an attack from the soldiers who had * the order to burn the * through the night the fire * the sea of darkness rolled over the town and * of men women and children went about the streets * with what * they could * from the flames the * * * the * windows of the stores and * everything upon which they could seize the * had become a * * and the * of * seemed to have been * to the streets of richmond about nine oclock monday morning a * of * * startled even ears which would seem to have * every possible * of painful sounds every window in our home was * and the old * * built

were * in full force the colored troops of general * who had been stationed on the north side of the james a few miles from richmond entered the city as i saw their black faces shining through the gloom of the * town i could not help thinking that they added the one * needed if any there were to complete the * character of the scene they were the first colored troops i had ever seen and the * effect produced by their black faces in that * * was * impressed upon my mind general * sent major a h * of the fourth massachusetts cavalry and major e e * of his staff at the head of a hundred mounted men to * the richmond roads and works at the * beyond the junction of the * turnpike and new * road they were met by a flag of * waved from a * * carriage drawn by a pair of * horses the * party consisted of the * of richmond colonel * judge * of the supreme court judge * a * man of virginia and at one time minister to england and a fourth whom i do not now recall the carriage was

side out for * in writing was not judge * still judge * a member of old * * a former minister to the court of st james with all the cold and stately * with which he might once have presented to the

officer it was from no failure of duty on the part of him upon whom yet rested some shadow of the royal glory which * the court of st james upon the * side of the * were * these words it is proper to * surrender to the federal authorities the city of richmond * capital of the confederate states of america and the * * it up to this time major * * accepted the surrender on behalf of his commanding general to whom the * was * and proceeded to * the * * property to possession by * fighting the flames which were * * * with him having * to good effect what little * of the fire department he could find he ordered the stars and * to be raised over the capitol two soldiers of the fourth massachusetts cavalry one from company e and one from company h mounted to the * of the capitol and in a few moments for the first time in more than four years the national flag * * in the * of the south the stars of the union were * while our * * took its flight to meet the * soul that flag which almost a century before had * from the clouds of war like a star * out through the darkness of a * night with its design * to both washington and john * was raised over virginia by massachusetts in place of the one whose * and * to the old * had never been entirely destroyed in march 1861 the confederate congress adopted the stars and bars three * bars of equal * the middle one white the others red with a blue union of nine stars in a circle this was so like the national flag as to cause confusion in 1863 this flag was * by a * with a white field having the * a red field charged with a blue * on which were thirteen stars for a union it was feared that this might be mistaken for a flag of * and was changed by * the * half of the field with a * red bar this was finally adopted as the flag of the confederate states of america richmond will * that the soldiers of massachusetts were worthy of the honor of first raising the united states flag over the capitol of the confederacy and will also bear witness to the * courtesy of major * and the * with which he kept his trust it has seemed * that i should begin my story with the burning city for fire has followed me all my life my story i say * has said to write history we must be a part of that history my story has been so closely * with that of pickett and his division that it does not seem quite an * * for me to appear in the record of that * band how could i tell the story and the way in which that story was written and not be apart of it * by the * hand of general butler in * for the telegram which general grant sent to president lincoln pickett has * up butler at * hundred fire destroyed our beautiful * home on the james the good old hero of appomattox was my husbands very dear friend and he would have been more * with his * had he known that his friend must pay so heavy a * upon them the united states government was also charged * heavy * upon that message for the * home stood very far away from the line of war and butler coming from city point at an * of many * made a * on the war * out of all * to any * result accomplished by the * of his personal spite in the burning of richmond all my * * and my household furniture were * when the general was made president of southern * for the washington life * company we shut up our little cottage home on * island and took * at the * hotel in richmond the following christmas we went to spend the sacred season with our dear grandmother her last * on earth on our return the next night the general ordered the * to take us to the * the * of that part of the building where our rooms were * were burned to death though fire had again * us of our * through a * * our lives had been spared to my home in washington late one night came a poor man who asked for help he said that he was one of picketts men that he had come to the end of his * and had nothing to eat and * to sleep i went back to my sons room to get some money and thought i * something burning opening the door leading down into the * just beneath my sons room a * of smoke struck me in the face * back to the * where i had left the man standing i sent him to the * * to give the alarm the * came in time and for once by what seemed a mere accident i escaped the fate which has followed me with such * * a flame of * * by a * servant destroyed the * portrait of the general given me by picketts men it hung upon my wall guarded on one side by the beautiful confederate flag presented to me by the philadelphia brigade and on the other by a handsome united states flag a * * from my loved * the two * for which so much blood and * had been * were fastened together by a * of confederate gray and union blue the design of a * and * boy a son of one of picketts men and met above the * head of the soldier who had fought so bravely under them both when the flames were * the portrait was a * ruin and * and * were a * of ashes on the floor fire destroyed the first * of the story of pickett and his men in the preparation of which thirteen years of labor had been spent let me hope that the only fire which will * to my present effort to record the history of those gallant soldiers is the * out flames which * over the unfortunate capital of the confederacy the fire revealed many things which i would like never to have seen and having seen would * forget one of the most * * was the amount of provisions and shoes and clothing which had been * by the * who * like * over the scene of death and * taking advantage of their possession of money and their * of both patriotism and humanity they had by an early corner in the * and by successful * bought up all the * supplies with an eye to future gain while our soldiers and women and children were absolutely in * and * and * not even war with its horrors and * can * such * from their accustomed * of * wealth at the * of those of their fellow men who have spent their lives in less * ways all my own little store was a small * of * and * and a * of * no * even to season them and i an officers wife how much worse it must have been for those less * than i the general had left me in richmond when he went away to fight the battle of five forks telling me to stay until he returned or sent for me i shall surely * he said so like * i waited and not even the flames that * the battles * should * me away though my husbands friend general * our secretary of war had in his * offered me the opportunity of leaving our dear old confederate capital with him and his family i remembered that general pickett had left me here and * determined to remain until he should come or send for me i * * general * for his kindness but said i am like the boy who stood on the burning * i can not go until the one voice calls me so my husbands good friend was * forced to leave me the days were made up of * and * * the * struck only midnight hours for me * of the death of the general were * i saw by the look in * face though no word was said and i would not ask a question nor let * speak to me of him the last letter i had received from him had been * the 30th of march at * run the extreme right of the confederate line at that time most of the letter was written in * this is a * from it heavy * roads and * almost * while general lee was holding a conference with his * this morning a message came from general fitz lee * that through a prisoner he had learned that the federal cavalry fifteen thousand strong supported by heavy infantry were at or near * courthouse this decided the generals plans and he has placed general fitz lee in command of the whole cavalry * w h f lees and his own with orders to march upon five forks i am to support with my small force of artillery and infantry this movement and take command of the whole force the letter was in full faith of a short separation and that all would be well that he would surely return and * me not to listen to or credit any * to the contrary and urged me in an added line to be brave and of good cheer to keep up a * * this letter was brought to me by * a daring * * in my husbands * as a headquarters * he was * and loyal perfectly devoted to my husband and his cause and was trusted with letters of the * confidence and importance all through the war as i said before our people were on the * of * the army had been living on rations of corn and * with * of * for weeks before we left camp a * even had been considered a * * for months past the game had been * and killed throughout the whole country and my breakfast that morning had consisted of a few * * in water no * for * had been a * for a long time in the confederacy all the old * had been moved that the earth might be * up and * down to get the * which in the many years it had absorbed john * my dear little brother nine years old was a great comfort to me in these days of trial he had just brought up my * and was * * me to eat them when * came a * was filled for * and after he had finished his * breakfast * with his * in getting to me * the river at one place with his clothes tied up in a * on his head etc he said he must go i added a few lines to my * of all my acts which i always kept for the general and gave it to our faithful * to take back to him in a * days to come said * in his soft * voice * all * no matter * people * * * money no matter you find * here and here first putting his hand over his heart and then drawing from his * and * * a shining * * at the door he turned back and * his * * out five pieces of money three gold dollars and two * he walked over on * to where our baby was sleeping crossed himself and * by the * slipped into * little closed hand two of the gold dollars and around his neck a much worn and * * dear faithful old * he would take no * so i let baby keep the money and used it to buy milk for him for i had not a * in the world i was reading aloud * and * the torn words on the ragged * * which * had given to baby * the heart of * is with me when baby opened his sweet eyes and * over the little fortune which had come to him in his dreams and just then my little brother who had gone * with * came * back his eyes wide open all excitement * sister sister * a yankee * come to see you but dont you go * * sister ill * the door and he * pass by me quick sister * he said he was one of brother * friends but dont you believe him sister he has killed brother george and now he wants to kill you oh no no my child i said * trying to * and calm him no no dont be such a little * dear if he is one of your brother * friends he is mine too and he would do me no hurt i am not in the least afraid and i will go down right away and see him you are not afraid of anything sister and you will get killed yet as sure as you are born and brother george told me to take care of you what will he say when he comes back and * you dead and gone and nobody to * you course ill nurse the poor baby for you if you will go but sister please * dont go i shall be * to death till you come back thats a sweet boy take care of the baby i said and * them both closed the door behind me as i entered the parlor a tall thin gentleman with the * of smiles and the * of voices dressed in the uniform of a united states surgeon arose and said as he bowed holding his hat against his breast thus * offering me his hand my name is george * madam i am one of george picketts friends although as soldiers we have been enemies in the field for more than three years that however does not * with us when we are not on duty i have heard that you southern women were very bitter and i did not know how you his wife you are picketts wife are you not madam would take a visit from me but i came nevertheless knowing pickett as well as i do i know he would appreciate my * in coming your name is a very familiar one dr * i said i have often heard the general speak of you and remember many stories of your * your love for * and * for all natural history in fact i wished him to know that i remembered him and had not mistaken him for another and also that i had reason to wonder at seeing him in his present position he often spoke of your having been with him at fort * bay and knowing how you felt when he left the old army he has often wondered at your remaining and going to the front i am a surgeon in grants army said dr * * * and by his manner almost * my reference to his former sympathy with the south i love pickett and came as he would have come had our positions been * to see his wife and offer her my services i * this * gentleman and distinguished officer but was too bitter to accept the * courtesy at his hands even in my husbands name and though offered for loves sake so bitter that suffering was * to such * he bowed and was going when i said doctor is there any news of the army ours i mean the war is over madam you have my address if you should change your mind and will show me how i can serve you he bowed and left he too had heard that the general had been killed and believed it and i * him worse because of his belief on the evening of the #* of april i was walking the floor baby was asleep and my little brother was walking behind me when i heard grand victory at five forks pickett killed and his whole division captured it seemed very strange to me that in the streets of richmond my dear old home the capital of the confederacy the death of pickett and the capture of his whole division should be * as a grand victory how great a change had come in so short a time even the * had gone over to the enemy * so sister * so dont you believe him said my little brother hush sir hush he * called out of the window to the * hush this minute * your big stories out loud and * everybody to death * like to * those five forks through your old black * for you * got any heart i know aint you ashamed of yourself you good * old * you there aint a word of truth in brother george being killed and you know it you old thing ill go down and * his mouth for him and * him to death for * you so my poor sister poor sister yes * just like to kill that boy sister * i would but it * so my sister you trust in the lord i know brother george is not killed for he said he * get killed no it is not so you are right my darling your brother george is not killed i said yes he will * he will come back he said he would and he will i * god then and i thank god now for the sweet comfort of that precious little brother john t * my little * and friend and for his * and love in all the * years oh the * nights that followed each other after that in * * * one morning i had * dressed baby george and had taken him to the window to hear the spring sounds and * the spring * and catch the * * gold * the top of the * * of the * and * it was the time when the * of the year is in perfect * when all the world is * when the birds sing of love the * and * of joy the * and * of hope and faith and when each * of wind makes a * of * * through the * and * of leaves and * of flowers and soft * of * came the words * lucy * little girl oh those tones those words that voice * my heart so that i wonder it did not burst from very * such joy such gratitude as * my soul only the * of all good can know all the * and * and * of the past four years and the * and trials * and * of those last dreadful days were swept away by those blessed precious words * lucy spoken in my husbands tender tones how i got down the * i do not know i do not remember with baby in my arms we were both of us in my husbands almost before lucy had been given into the hands of the * i do not know how to describe the peace the * of that moment it is too deep and too sacred to be * into words i think that it is * to the feeling that will come to me in the * when i have gone through all these dark days of * and of * of heart and soul here * and at last am safe within the golden * and waiting and listening shall hear again the voice that said * lucy here * me welcome there all through the war lucy had brought the general to me * and beautiful she had many times carried him twenty miles in an evening to see me often through * greater than battle lucy was not the generals * she was the little * * * he always rode when he came to see me his * his * he called her and * the generals * * to her would say the horse the general used in battle he called old black a steady * strong * animal that while * to the generals * touch or command allowed no one else on * of death to mount her my fathers home was in * * county virginia about thirty miles from norfolk * opposite * news after the * of norfolk by the confederate forces all that part of the country was * ground being occupied one day by federal troops and another by the confederates lying thus between the two lines a constant * was carried on by the * of both armies i had not been to my fathers home since i was married and was not prepared for the * war had made our own home on the james had been burned to ashes at the command of butler and for * we had * to go but to my fathers we had nothing we both knew however that a loving welcome awaited us * my fathers home we knew that he had an * to eat * great * the * ran but a * throw from the back door * with but little labor * * * and * in * and * was * it was there then to my * home that the general decided we should go but how there was no way of getting there no * running and the railroad was * for miles around then again there was no money my husband had not a * in the world and our friends were no better off on the afternoon of the second day after the generals return while we were * about going my little brother * came running in saying sister i saw riding by the door just now that same yankee who came here to see you the other day and who said he was brother * friend he knew me and asked how you were and * the baby oh i forgot i must tell you all about it i said and i then told the general of the visitor i had had before he came back when i had told him all his gray eyes filled with tears and looking down he said tenderly dear old * god bless him thats just like him where is his * find it for me please little one dear old * dear old fellow so true he said looking at the * i stooped down and took the generals dear head in both my hands and raising it up looked down * into his earnest loving eyes to see how he could possibly speak so kindly and so affectionately of a yankee so you have that same kind of * feeling too i see that this yankee doctor spoke of having i said with surprise and rather * for me too i am afraid i must find the dear old fellow the general said * * my * of spirit and * himself and taking leave of baby and me he went out at once in a little while he came back saying it is very fortunate for us little one that i went out when i did * goes down the river tomorrow to norfolk in the * steamer and he has kindly invited us to go with him dear old * * come let us lose no time let us * and get our little * together and be ready we will not say anything about our plans to any one till tomorrow morning when we can * our * and say our * * not only had this yankee officer in his * feeling for the general kindly * to * us to our home but to carry our * and horses in fact all we had which alas was very very little most of our * * all of our * * * library pictures silver furniture * piano * everything except a few clothes had been * at kent * * and had been burned in the awful fire the night of the * of richmond the generals staff had one by one come in during the day from the field and camp and all * with us for the last time next morning in the old pickett home at the corner of sixth and leigh streets the military family had broken up at appomattox after lees surrender and the dear old headquarters confederate flag the general himself * * into * and divided among them such a happy family they had been the second social parting was sad too for they had taken me the child wife into their lives twenty months before and they all loved me and called me sister their pride in each other and in their command the * that together they had * the * * of good times and bad had bound them together in * stronger than * spite of the * the loss of our cause our disappointment and * there was to me a sweet * peaceful feeling of * in my heart and gratitude to god that the war was over that my husband had been spared and belonged now only to me that we * going home and together free from * could rest under the * of our own trees the next morning at ten oclock dr * called in his headquarters * to take us to the steamer just at the close of breakfast we had announced our intention of going there was to be a sudden breaking up and * of old * the staff were all en route to their * homes except the * general major charles pickett he and mrs dr * well only brother and sister of my husband were to remain with their families for a time in the old pickett home we said our sad * in the great * and flower garden at the rear of the house and passing all alone through the large * and wide * crept quietly out and softly closed the door behind us the only evidence of life in the dear old home as we looked back was dr * big dog which having escaped from the back yard * * within the * the * and * had not been opened or raised since the federal forces had occupied the city as we * the steamer that morning i realized for the first time that our cause was lost never before in all the days of my dear married life but cheer after cheer had greeted us wherever we had gone * from soldier or * whether on or off duty this morning these * were * by * of surprise of mingled curiosity and hate dr * recognized this feeling at once and with a * smile at my * expression of rage put his arm in that of the general and with a * glance at the men walked * on board i was shown into the * * in which there were many * of * care for my comfort we were soon under way the general and dr * called each other by their given names and laughed and talked as cordially as if they had loved the same dear cause and fought for it side by side at the table they * to each others health and to the friends and memories of * times a stranger could not have told which of the two soldiers had * his * they * of texas and the great * * which had changed the political * of the nation away back in what seemed to my youthful view a * * they talked of mexico and the general recalled * of the battles in which he had fought in that wonderful * country they * the wild free fresh * life of the * * coast the wealth of the * of * its * and * * and the friends they had known there they talked of the great * that was like a * region to me of the * indians and of * * island and the english officers who had occupied the island * with the general i found myself * if it had been a dream and there had been no * * just before reaching city point which is a few hours distance from richmond dr * came up to me and said we are going to stop for general * who wishes to come on board to pay his * to you and george i dont suppose there is any one in the wide world * * loves more than he does your husband and i hope madam you will meet him with more * than you did another of your husbands friends at least for the sake of their * friendship you will not hurt him he turned for sympathy to my husband who looked * at him and * at me presently the general drew me to one side and whispered * * my wishes my little wife and i want you to meet my old friend just as cordially as you can put your little hand in his and forget everything except that he is one of your husbands * and dearest friends i promised my husband with all my heart to do what he asked and i really meant to do it i loved to do everything he bade me i * him to make things hard for me sometimes that i might show him how * and loving my * was but when general * came * was given a * and received as became his rank with the * the absence of which i had marked when my own general came i slipped my hand out of my husbands and ran back to my * as fast as i could there i burst out crying and shook our baby * him and told him how papa had been treated that poor papa had not had any * paid him at all and that a dreadful old bad yankee general had come on board and taken them all and that when he grew up and was a big man he must fight and fight and fight and never surrender and never forgive the yankees no not even if his poor * papa asked him to do so i told him how his papa had asked me to shake hands with this yankee general because he was his friend and that i was going to do it because papa wanted me to that i tried and could not and that he never must either never never i did not know there was a witness to all

steamer * in the lines and * away and more names were added to the list of yankees for baby not to hate the general did not like to fight his battles over he said that the memories they * were too bitter to be * the faces of the dead and dying soldiers on the field of battle were never forgotten the sorrow of * and * * all the glory for him in the presence of memory he was silent the * sorrow like the * joy is * we are both too worn and weary now for * else but to rest and comfort each other he said we will * out of our lives everything but its * from * defeat and mourning shall spring * for the past strength for the present courage for the future now that in * to the command of general lee i have finished and sent off the report of the last fight of the old division the closing days of our dear lost cause we will put up the pen for * and lay aside our war thoughts we will rest and plan for peace and then after a time we will take up the pen again and write down our memories for

clear sky this sweet rest which we had * for ourselves however was of but short * we had been at my fathers home only a few days when a private * brought letters of warning from some of the generals old army friends two officers high in authority * for his * advised that in the existing * * * condition of things he should absent himself for a while until calm reflection should take the place of

the upper gate it was ten oclock the moon was shining * and all was quiet and still the generals plan for me was that i should go next day to norfolk take the steamer to baltimore and visit his aunt whose husband had been in the old army and who had not left it to join the southern confederacy though his sons had fought on that side one of them having been * on duty at my husbands headquarters my aunt will welcome you he said and you will remain with her until a telegram shall come to you saying * is better * was my husbands middle name that telegram would mean that he was safe and that i was

* i was not to start but remain with his aunt until another message came cheer up the shadows will * soon already bright * and happy * * through my brain and * my heart so keep up a * * * little one and take care of yourself watch for the telegram * is better for it will surely come now keep up your courage and have faith for it will surely come god bless you i smiled up at him as he repeated the familiar old saying keep up a * * a brave heart little one he had learned the * from an old * * on the * coast and in the * days of the * struggle when hope died in the heart and the sun seemed to have left the sky forever he would * my face * look down upon it with his kind eyes smile gently and say in a cheerful voice keep up a * * dear one i listened to the sound of the * of the horse his * dear old lucy away in the distance long after he was out of sight then i remembered a * of my childhood which had been taught me by a * * and putting my ear to the ground i listened for the steps until the last * was lost the * sighed with me as i walked back * keep up a * * my * lay * with the * creek a * throw to the left the * was high and still coming in the * of its waves seemed to call out to me * * * * i could not be all desolate when the most beautiful forces of nature * his words called to me keep up a brave heart brave heart my precious old father had waited to have us say * alone and was now coming forward to meet me our baby * just as we got in i * to baby the secret of the telegram and told him papa said it would surely come and papa always said what was true the stars were burning * in the midnight sky to light the * on his way as he went * off could there be light on the * that led him from me had his face been turned * with his eyes fixed * upon the loved home where he would be * when his journey was over what radiant glory would have * the way far up in the * i could see our star * * * to reach out fingers of light to touch me in loving * it was a pure white star that sent down * of * * near it was a red star * and beautiful but i did not love it it seemed to glow with the * * of war my great loving tender white star was like a * of peace looking down with * * our star he had said as we stood together only one little evening before how long ago it seemed and gazed * to find what comfort we might in its soft * wherever we may be we will look * into the night sky where it * with steady light and feel that our thoughts and hearts are together i fell asleep saying softly in my heart gods * to guide him there were no * and no * from my home to norfolk but my father secured a * a little * and the following day we baby and i started off my fathers heart was almost broken at parting from me so soon again i was going he knew not where but knowing that what god * joined together no man should put * he could not say one word to keep me a storm came up just after we had * out of * creek and we were delayed in * at norfolk we had hoped to be there some hours before the departure of the baltimore steamer but reached the * as the plank was about to be taken in so that my father * had time to say * to me and put me on board alone except for baby george for the first time in all my * years perhaps no * little * thrown out upon the deep sea of life ever felt more utterly desolate i stepped on board the baltimore steamer and was * into the * by a porter whose look and manner showed that he was perfectly * of my * and * in the midst of my * and the consciousness of my * and my real * sympathy for myself * my * * for poor * * whom * servant had made to feel so young and green so little did i know of * and the * and * of * that i sent for the captain of the steamer to buy my * and * for my * and supper i wondered a little as i waited for him what he would think of my * and if he often had such helpless * and if he had what he did with them and if life was not sometimes made a burden to him because of them there was always an * though of * of my position and of dread because of it i had one * reflection however the captain could not take me for a * my * was too * and * to be mistaken for assumed * i had been told on leaving my home that the * * or * word from me might cause my arrest and that in any event if it were known who i was it was more than possible that i might be held as a * for my husband after consideration it had been decided that i should travel not under my own name but under my * name the more i * the subject the more * i became how could i keep my precious secret i determined to be very silent and guard my * closely and answer in * that would * * i began to draw my face down and look serious and wise and * an expression of profound * then it occurred to me that this * would never do in the few * i had read the people who had * were always silent and * their * said more plainly than words could have expressed * the modern * whose * can never be read every one would recognize immediately the fact that my mind was the * of something dangerous then i thought i would * a light and * style more in * with my natural character so i was soon in my thought in conversation with some * person on home scenes and * * an * that ought to remove from the mind of the most * person the fancy that i could possibly have anything to * i found that my mental * to what the general said and did were quite too * and * to be in * with my assumed character of an unknown little wife and mother * for the innocent purpose of * a few days with relations * her * husband to come for her after * from a little farm that he was * * if i could neither talk nor be silent what could i do while i * with these * my train of thought was interrupted by the * of a bell and aloud voice * * will please walk into the * office and show their * the laws were so * that no one could leave any city in the south without a * from the military authorities stationed there my grandmother had given me her oath of allegiance which everybody in those dread days immediately after the surrender of the army was compelled to take in order to * * food or clothing of any sort or for the * of any kind of business * it was a rare * that a man was found who would take this * oath for no matter how great the * might be he was * as a * if he yielded to them consequently the women who were most bitter too in their feelings were obliged to make a sacrifice of their * and principles and take this oath in order to * or prevent the * suffering of their loved ones illness in the family and the * necessity for * and * left my * little grandmother no * and having taken this oath herself she found in it a kind of safety it had at any * brought her relief and she wanted that i should have it with me as a sort of * or * with * basket and baby i started into the * office and explained to the officer in charge i am very sorry sir that i have no * the steamer was about to * as i reached norfolk i came from a little village thirty miles beyond where * are not given i have an oath of allegiance if that will answer in its place the officer laughing said no never mind it is all right only * your name i remember you did come on board just as the * * but was there not another * who came on with you a gentleman yes sir i said it was my precious father and he went back home on the little * there must have been something to * * in the way i wrote my name or else in my manner i * wrote out my given name and then as i started to write my last name i looked all around me * and changed the letter p to c writing * then i began to * * and write * the name in my oath of allegiance while there was really nothing very false in what i did i felt * and was frightened for i had been brought up to be * * and to keep faithfully even the word of promise i had not been long in the * when baby became restless and * i was * awaiting the coming of the captain whom i had sent for when a man appeared he had short * hair deep heavy * eyes * and close together as if they had to be * by his big * nose or they would not be able to see he was * * one end of his * * and one side of his thick red lip and was making a * noise with his * as he said madam you sent for the captain of the boat i believe yes sir what do you wish i want you to be kind enough to get my * and * please my father had not time to see after me he * had time to put me on board certainly with pleasure you stop in baltimore * dont know i said you have been there before i suppose oh no never i have been * outside of virginia and north carolina most of my * before my marriage was in going to and from lynchburg where i was at school lynchburg is a * city it was * by an * * john * whose brother colonel charles * of * fame * the * colonel * was a great * and too * to wait for the * ceremony of * * justice upon the * * once i rode on horseback to the * of * which are among the highest mountains of the south you cant imagine how glorious it was to be up there so far away from the earth when i first looked down from their lofty heights the sky and the earth seemed to be touching and presently the rain began to * i could see the * glittering * but could not hear them fall i was above the clouds and the rain up in the sunshine and * the only * sound a strange * * it was the * and * * their wings suddenly the rain ceased the * * and i saw below the * mountains and what seemed in the distance a vast ocean it was the * country below the words of john randolph * in my heart with this * * of nature he with only a servant had spent the night on those mighty * and in the morning as he was watching the glory of the sunrise having no one else to whom to express his thought he pointed * with his long slender hand and charged his servant never from that time to believe * who said there was no god you have relatives in baltimore said the gentleman * * me otherwise feeling that * and history were safe subjects i should have * on till i had told him all i knew yes sir said i i am going to visit them where were you from this morning i came from a little country village about thirty miles from norfolk * a village in * * county it used to be the capital city of a * of indians called the * i saw your father as he was leaving the steamer i was attracted to him because he made an appeal to all * asking of them poor man with his hands raised to god their protection and care for his child and * he thus was making himself known to any of us his brothers who might be * when he was lost sight of by the turn of the boat so you see you can safely * in me and i will help you in any way i can thank you i said i know my dear dear papa s a * i know he was anxious about me but i have nothing to * nothing i only want a * and my * and some milk for the baby i do not wish for any supper myself i am so * i could not eat it is * to feel blue and * with baby and all the kind friends to watch over me as you say and then too god is always near yes that is true did you lose your husband in the war no sir he was in the war though was he not yes sir a fear came into my heart that i was talking too much i did not want him to know anything concerning my husband whose rank i especially desired to keep secret i * myself with the reflection that the end * the means even though i might * slightly from the truth and said you could not have heard of him and he was not of sufficient rank to have made an impression upon you even if you had where is he now in the country and you are leaving him for a little while only then he talked of how much the * had lost and how much they had to forgive how easy it was to bear victory and how hard to bear defeat and said that if he had been born south he would have been a rebel and that his * even now were with the southern people then a sudden * came to me and i said i wish there had never been any rebels at all no not even the first rebel george washington and now sir please i do not want to talk about the war i am very weary and * and would like to retire if you please sir will you get me my * and * i am so tired so very tired baby was lying asleep on my lap * by the * the man looked down on him for a moment and then said of course i * get them for you and was going * an * officer one of my husbands old comrades and friends came up and cordially reaching out his hand said how do you do mrs pickett where is the general what are you doing here and where are you going he himself was returning to his home in the far south but had been called back to baltimore on business thank you general b i said my husband has gone to * he has turned his sword into a * and # am going to visit his aunt whom i have never seen he is to come to us after a little while could not leave * just now he is very well i thank you i am so glad to have seen you he said will see you later on and was * away on his * he saw by my manner that he had said something to * me something * to me and left with a * look he was dressed in his old confederate gray the * * had all been cut off in * to the order at the * office for several moments not a word was spoken then i looked up and said my * and * please i thought you said your name was * said he of the * nose as he held my money * in his hand i thought you said your husbands rank was not sufficient to have made an impression that in all * i had never heard of him oh that * sound of * and * and that * of a nose and those little black eyes which grew into * * as they * at me like a * he did not move but said while an * fear of him made me * and grow cold your name was * and your husband was in the country he was an officer of low rank he repeated this more to himself than to me did i say that i said and with a face all * and truth i looked straight into those eyes divided by that * * and told without * without a * in my voice the first * * i had ever told did i say so well my mind has been * my friends think by the way the war has ended and they are sending me from home to new scenes and new * to * me with the hope of making me well and strong again * was my * name but i do not know how i happened to say that my husbands rank was low for i was so proud of it i could not have been thinking wont you please be so good as to get my * i am so tired i dont know what i am saying he went away and the * * were brought to me by a * she * the door for me i went in too frightened now to think of supper too frightened to sleep and * if in my * i had hurt my husband and what would * if i had all night long the noise of the * was to me the * of the * all night long it rose and fell through * not of water but of blood the hearts blood of * men of devoted women of innocent little children all night long it went up and down * from the awful sea * with my husbands blood with my fathers with the blood of all the friends i had known and loved then it seemed as if all the world but me had been * to make that dread sea and i was * to move over it forever with the sound of the * * * my heart to * and never * me why had i of the whole human race been left alone to go always up and down in that horrible * of blood near morning i fell asleep and * that it was i who had destroyed all that world of people whose * * around me with a * roar and that i was destined to an * of * when i * the boat had * i got up and dressed * * to go out i found that the door was locked on the outside the * not * my repeated call i * to a * passing the window and begged that he would tell the * that i was locked in and ask her to come and let me out she came to the door and said you can not get out i do not understand i said are we not at baltimore an officer was with her who answered yes but you can not get off madam you are to be * upon the boat until the authorities come and either * or * you you are supposed to be a * character on a * of paper i wrote a master * wife and daughter in distress * in their name that you will come to her i said to the * will you give this to the captain on her * the officer said you might as well she went in a little while a very little while before i thought she could possibly have reached the captain while i was trying to hush the baby who was hungry a voice as kind and gentle as the * face into which i looked said what can i do for you madam you sent for me no sir i said i sent for the captain of the boat but i am glad you came you seem so kind and may help me in some way in my trouble i am the captain of the boat he said what can i do for you you are not the gentleman who represented himself as the captain of the boat last night sir and bought for me my * he was short and dark as i was * the * the gentleman interrupted me with he is a federal * madam and has advised that you be * on the steamer until his return with the authorities and * but i said he told me he had seen my father as he left the steamer make the sign of a master * in distress * me in the care not only of himself but of all * on this steamer and he told me i was safe and * in their care and he asked my confidence but i had none to give him he * me of what the captain said your father did make that sign your father did place you in our care his appeal was to all * and in their protection he did leave you come i am captain of this steamer and a captain is king on his own boat where did you say you wished to go stand aside he said to the officer in charge giving me his arm he placed me and baby * and basket in a carriage and the * was told to drive to # * street * * said the * # * * * god bless you and watch over you * little baby after driving some time the * * told me there was no street by that name and i would have to get out but not until i had paid him for the two hours he had been * for the same i will pay you the money said i but there must be such a place come here is the letter and the instructions * no place of the * an the letter is

was at my * end if i had ever had any * there was not a soul in the city that i knew i thought of the captain of the boat the only friend i had yet i was afraid to go back to seek him for fear the power he had would not be strong enough to protect me once i had left his boat i could think of no one else * else to go and there was that in the * voice and manner of daring and strength that made me willing to trust myself with him so i said drive me back to the captain of the boat please i dont know what else to do when i went on board the captain was not yet gone which was an unusual thing he had waited to see the officers before leaving i answered the smile that came into his face in spite of his kind heart by * him my * letter who wrote not only a very peculiar hand but a very * one saying read captain and see if this is not * street the place my aunt has written me i must come go to # * street where my * mrs c will bring you to my house he read it might be anything else as well

the little lost bird till you can write to your friends and find out where they do want you to come off again i started with the * who had become interested in me by this time and had forgotten all about the * here you are * # * * an a nice house it is * shall i take * things in * no first take up my * if your horses will stand * * * an they will i wrote on my * does mrs c live here a * of mrs s in a moment there were two or three faces at the windows and in another moment as many voices at the * asking is this george picketts wife and child and i was so * to be once more where they knew george picketts wife and child besides the lovely people whose home it was there was with them on her way to her mothers a daughter of mrs s mrs general b who was one of the most charming women i ever met she had just returned from the south her husband too was in the confederate army the next day we both went out to her mothers my husbands * home the week i spent in * county maryland at the generals * * me of my childhood when i used to play that i was a * or a * or * of the forty * or the white * or whatever character it would please me to select to play for my heart and soul were separated from my body i was not what i * to be my body went to parties and * and * and received people and drove and paid calls while my soul waited with intense * for the telegram * is better one day i had been out to * and coming home found awaiting me the message for which eyes and heart had been looking for a time that seemed almost eternal that night i took the train for new york * out all alone again baby and i i was tired and * but there was such joy and * in my heart as i thought of so soon seeing my husband that i did not think of my * i repeated the telegram * is better * is better over and over again i sang it as a * putting baby to sleep to the measure of the happy words * is better i * it softly with shut lips lest some stranger should hear the precious words * is better only for baby and me was that sweet * when baby slept i leaned back and closed my eyes and saw a world of beauty and * as the glad words went * through my heart was there ever so sweet a * since * were first * to * the * * of mother hearts i went to sleep with baby in my arms i had not money enough to get a * just * enough to buy my * and pay my * through to * * from which point the telegram was * when i * later i found that a * shawl had been placed under my head i never thought about who had been so kind nor why the *# was there all my life long every one had been * of me things had been done for me * had been extended * and i had learned to accept * as only what i had a right to expect from the human race * softly the * words * is better i turned my face over and went to sleep again on the shawl i slept until my baby became restless from the * we took the steamer up the * from new york to * something made poor little baby sick i * myself for having allowed him to catch cold on the train while i was sleeping he was * and was very * he had been used too to his nurse his black mammy he * her * care and attention his * and * and was unhappy and could not understand it she used to give him his * to sing to him her negro * and to dance him up and down in her strong arms only bringing him to me for his daily * and * and my own * of him or when sometimes she wanted to go to her * before thomas was ready to put him in his little wagon so in his * he would reach out his hands and * to * to take him he was tired of me and thought that i must in some way be the cause of all these * and the pain and suffering he was then * * ladies on board the steamer seemed very much * and at a loss to understand why he was so unhappy with me and apparently preferred * and everybody else nurse why do you not take the child to its mother one would say and a look of * would follow my assertion that i was its mother then why dont you quiet the child if you are and find out what is the matter with it and so on how * i was something in my manner must have made them believe that it was not all right with me and the child for they followed me about asking many * questions and making many * * the crying of the baby was as * to them as it was * to me and i was walking the * trying to quiet him all tired and worn out as i was when a gentleman came up to me on his shoulder i recognized the shawl that had been put under my head on the cars the night before it introduced one of the least of these he said madam excuse me but i do not think you have had any dinner and you must be worn out with * and * from * and carrying the baby wont you let me hold him while you go down and eat something even though he carried the shawl which * my faith i was afraid to trust him with so precious a * as my baby and would rather have * than have permitted it to go out of my sight thank you very much but i could not think of * you i said no oh no then said he may i order something for you here i was hungry and was so glad for the open way he had found for me and said yes * him twentyfive * it was all i could afford to pay for dinner but as i looked at the * when it was brought to me i thought how * things must be in new york for there was * and * a kind of yellow * i had never seen before * i afterward learned it was * with green * a bird some * and * * a cup of coffee and a glass of * upon his * that perhaps it would be * to the baby i let him hold it while i * my dinner i did not know how hungry i was nor how much i was in need of * baby immediately became quiet in his arms whether it was the change or not i do not know but in a little while he was fast asleep i covered him up with the shawl to which the gentleman pointed finished * my * dinner taking my time and * it while he read his book and held my baby when the servant came and took away the * i arose and * the stranger for his kindness said i will take the baby now if you please if you would rather he said yes but i think he will be more comfortable with me for * then too you might * him if you moved him let me hold him while you rest here is a sweet little book if you would like to read it i think however it would be better for you to rest to sleep if you could you look really * out the book he gave me was a childs book it may have been * leaves i cant remember the name but written on the * in a childs * hand were these words little mary died on the #* of may 1864 her fifth * i rested but thought of little mary as i watched my own baby who was sleeping so * in this * strangers arms till presently the waves brought back * the days of my childhood the story of the * with his * mill * out * forever and forever and the lost * lost still back to my * knee listening with * to why the sea is * the while my soul * * to music those all * * words * is better * strength for the * trial i least * of and the shadows rose to make place for one * still my attention was attracted by a man in close conversation with the * i was evidently the object of it for they would look carefully over the paper they held and then at me as if * me with something * described had i been a * * they would probably not have taken the risk of thus warning me of the fact that i was under * as my appearance would seem to indicate that if a * i was a mere * in * they supposed they could safely take notes of me i was absolutely sure that i was the subject of the conversation and trembled with a * of coming evil i tried in vain to turn my face toward the window but my eyes seemed * a thousand * * passed in review through my mind though the real one never suggested itself i * to * them each in turn * that the * of the men * nothing because i seemed an object of curiosity to everybody and now as

slightly * and said in a voice clear and sweet gentlemen i have a witness my heart almost stood still here in the child who can not speak it is not always a proof of * but with the * evidence and the youth of this mother this beyond * is proof * the child is still * from her own body and she opened my * i who had never * my baby in the presence of even my most * friends * my bosom before all those

with his little * fingers and * enjoyed the proof the men turned aside and tears * down more than one * face the kind stranger with the shawl lifted his eyes * as if in * and then turned them * and breathed a bitter * deep and * perhaps the * angel * down the * on the credit side of the * with as great * as he * there the prayer of thanks i trust that the * ladies when the evidence was sent them were as surely * as all these people were that i had not * my child i hope they were pleased by this * of the existence of some degree of * in the world outside of their own * hearts but i dont know

the information that i would better return the * for exchange and i would receive my * on the next train the delight * upon this information taken in connection with my previous grief may have

than i was expected but i * followed instructions to remain on the train which stopped over at * until i should be claimed like a general * letter every * had left the * and baby and i were alone i was * and watching * for my * when my hungry eyes caught sight of three gentlemen coming straight toward me it was with but a * interest that i regarded them for i had * * as to the appearance of the * who should * * rights over me and neither of these * seemed at first glance * to * to those * the face of one seemed rather familiar but i was not sure so i drew my little baby closer to me and looked the other way i felt them coming and felt them stop right by my side what will you have of me i asked there were tears in the eyes of the gentleman whose face had seemed a familiar one and the next minute baby and i were in his great strong arms and his tender voice was * asking dont you know your husband little one i was looking for my general as i had been used to seeing him dressed in the dear old confederate uniform and with his hair long and * the beautiful hair had been * and while he was not subject to the * of * in the matter of personal strength a critical * might have * * in personal beauty an english * suit of rough brown * took the place of the old confederate gray the two gentlemen with him were mr * a * a brother of one of the generals * and mr * of baltimore a * i noticed that these gentlemen called the general mr * and me mrs * which made me feel somewhat strange and * but i * that i was in a foreign country and very far north of our old home and perhaps even * names were * by political and * conditions knowing our * i had expected the general to take us to a quiet little room in some * * but was too tired to voice my surprise when we were driven in a handsome carriage to a * home i remember the beautiful grounds the * and flowers the big english butler with * who opened the large * doors and the pretty girl in a cap who took baby from my arms after that i remember only being tired so tired so very tired when i had rested enough to remember again i was on a sofa dressed in a pretty soft * * and i heard a kind voice saying the lady is better she will be all right let her sleep * up i saw a * old gentleman and a pair of * i closed my eyes and heard the gentleman with the familiar face say such beautiful such sweet pleasant things and his voice and touch * my heart so that i kept my eyes shut and never wanted to open them again and presently the pretty girl with the cap on came in and baby was in her arms dressed in a beautiful * * * * very much no hungry now he eat * much * he sleep he * he dress he eat * much he no hungry he eat some more * much again he smile he now no very much hungry again some more was i in the land of * and was the gentleman with the familiar face the prince of * as he was the prince of * our * * arms and cry for me as he recognized me * any such * but i was too tired to hold out my hands to him i soon felt his little face however * close against my own and felt too the touch of yet another face and heard the same voice which had made my heart * with * * again more things like * those other things it had whispered but i was too tired and too happy to speak and my * seemed too sacred to open my eyes upon so i kept them closed when the old english physician came in the next day he said ah * ah * the lady is most well keep on * her and sleeping her she is * poor lady and * too by * ah * ah * poor lady that will do * her and sleep her * her and sleep her ah * ah * thats all when the old doctor was gone i remember listening for the * of the * outside * the ah * ah * with the tramp tramp tramp and as i asked the question brought back the memory that the war was over the guns were * the camp was broken and the general was all my very own i looked around * and up into the familiar face for answer and he my general explained our pleasant * his old friends mr and mrs james * he said had been suddenly * to england and had prayed him as a great favor to them to be their guest until their return as otherwise the delay to make the necessary arrangements for their going would prevent their * the first steamer thus we had a beautiful home in which to rest to grow well and strong to forget all that could be forgotten of the past and to enjoy the present the first week in june the french maid came to our room with a telegram for mr * * that mr and mrs * would * for home from england the following week my husband * about what time they would * and how soon we would be forced to give up the * of their beautiful and * home which we were then * we began to hunt for a place to live * with the * and larger * and * up with the * ones after a week of * and some very * * we decided at last upon one house * because of its * court and the pleasant * * it with its * * and pretty * and flowers how nice for our baby i said how cool and * the sound of the water and the * of green so for * sake the * was made and our rooms engaged our * was a very dark * and * herself upon being a french * but that man of mine she * said is a * * and you would hardly believe it possible he could be the father of our two beautiful daughters both of them are going to do well but they dont take after their * the * is engaged to be married to a * with nine * by the nine * and * i gathered from her explanation which she * in answer to my * look that the fortunate * was a yankee living in a small town in the state of * and * a little country store where * and cotton * * and * * * * * * and so forth were sold in her admiration of him after each * business she * the to her * title of * the second daughter she told me was * to sing she has a sweet voice but she dont take after her * she said and the young * * in the next room to the right of the one you have chosen is very much taken with her and it looks like * get both girls off my hands before long she said she could not give me the use of the * when the girls wanted them the * comes a long ways you know and has to have it all to himself when he is here but she * suggested that if none of them were * the parlor at the time when my company came she would let me * my visitors in it at the * of a * a dozen which * i considered a very good one for me as i did not expect to have more than a * worth of visitors perhaps in six months our * were to be served in our own room except on * when we would have to * in the public diningroom and do our own waiting like the others we did not exactly understand what that meant but one days experience proved it to be anything but comfortable the dinner had all been * on saturday and was cut up and * on the table in the * of the room and we each had to serve ourselves i could not help thinking of the time when my general had been served by * and * each anxious to be the first to * his wishes and all feeling * * for every effort by a pleasant word or an * smile i wondered how any one of those * * would feel to see us now the following * was about the * dinner with the * of course that on * it was warm * * * * * * * * * * and milk our breakfast was always cold the first one was cold bread * a * * which is the same as our * and * coffee and * our rooms had one * we were * every morning by the young lady making love to the bird of her * * while she arranged his room dear * * * * a * * * a soul * * * * to * dear * * * a dear * papa and dear * papa must * him a dear * * * * * * * who will take * of * and help him to make his people * * and help * and * papa to sing * too * again * * a sound as of the door opening a * and a * oh dear and then * was followed by the * excuse for not having finished * up the room and * before he came because * and i are such friends aint we * and time * so quickly dont it * i would know she was being * though i could hear only the sounds of his deep low tones between the * to * of course neither my husband nor i meant to listen to these * to * of course and i always put my fingers in his ears at the sound of them after our breakfast was over and baby had been made comfortable i usually sent him out with * for his walk and she was delighted at having him all to herself the rooms were comfortable and we found the long * where we spent our * and most of our * not only a very pleasant change but a * of * as well my curiosity was greatly excited concerning our * on the left i was * how many there were of them though i put them down in my mind as not less than half a dozen the first morning these * as i called them were as silent as the grave till about noon when all at once without any * * they commenced a most * conversation * with laughter * and * then the tones of their voices would change from * to * and then to grief so that at one time i was so full of sympathy with the poor man who was being driven out into the cold world that it was all i could do not to go in and * for him but while i was * all became quiet i supposed he was gone and all was over with him and * i offered up a prayer all the help i could give imagine if you can my surprise when the next morning at a little later hour # heard a * of the same painful scene the poor man had returned i * taking them all together i thought they certainly were a most curious family and i determined to * my husbands interest as soon as he came in something had prevented my telling him the day before that evening as we were sitting on the * i carried my resolution into effect and though he listened with his usual sweet patience my description of the * to my surprise excited in him more * than sympathy just as i had finished telling him our baby was brought in to be enjoyed and put to sleep the little * went to * the * ran up the * the * horse was * to * cross and after * * baby was ready and so were we for his * baby * when his sweet little * * ours grew * and * we began to sing in the * * the * prayer which my husband had taught to so many of the indians on the * coast and which we always sang at the last to make * sleep sound at the words * * * * * * * * thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven from through the open door of the room to our left a voice clear and sweet joined in the same * with ours to our father and as the last * was * * * * * * * * * send away far from us all evil * a handsome stranger stepped out and with * hand said to the general with great * * * * * how do you do friend give me your good hand then followed a conversation between them about the * coast fort * * * island * sound the * * and their many * friends of the * * all the while i was * what could have become of the other family if they could have gone and yet now and then i caught a tone in his voice as he talked to my husband that * very similar to the tones of the man in trouble belonging to them though i did not see how it would be possible for any one to drive or wish to drive him out of their home when after * i came in for the * of the season my astonishment knew no * when i learned that he had been the sole * of that room since sunday night the * in the court struck seven rising hastily and with many * this * man wrote something on his * and * it to my husband said i am playing at the * here tonight come and see me and was gone to this kind stranger william * i was * for my first taste of the * of the * almost every evening he with our permission joined us on the * shared our play with baby * and entertained the general and kindly took us afterward to * play yet during the whole of his stay four days he never once in the most * way * himself upon our confidence and though he knew there was some * in his * * he made no * to it on saturday evening when his engagement was over and he came to say * after * over the pleasant * we had passed together and putting great * upon the benefit they had been to him he stopped * saying * it all forgive me if i put my foot in it but here is something to buy a * for the * i * i absolutely have no use for it in fact i never had so much money at one time before in my whole life and it * by rights to the young * for if it had not been for the * in the * the * * over the moon getting the poor dog a * and our father who art in heaven i should have spent every red cent of it on the fellows please i * he said as my husband refused i know you have had more money than you seem to be * with now take this though we were both very much touched by the kind * of this stranger in a strange land the general was firm in his * well * and good * to you he said you are as obstinate as an * on the banks of the * here it goes putting the fifty dollars back into his pocket and turning to me with a tone i so well remembered he wished me happiness * i said may our father who art in heaven and his little ones whom he says suffer to come * me keep your heart * for others and gentle and kind all through this life believe in soul and be very sure of god in all the years that came afterward the friendship formed then between my husband and our first left * was never broken and to me it was a * the following week i noticed his rooms were taken by a very * acting lady and gentleman i saw there were two of them this time the second evening as i was putting baby who was * restless and * and would not be * or * to sleep the * lady with a * * tone and manner said the child * or * it need the * * whether the child needed the * with all or mrs * * * he stopped crying at once and while she talked on never took his startled eyes from her face till he * closed them * to sleep * * a nurse one that * * * she asked after i had put baby in his little bed yes madam i answered one whose love makes her so it is well she said and if * * not fear to leave the watch with her * * and thy husband come as our guests to see our * as we have * him to be it was the first of * * i had ever seen and my blood ran cold as i * watched the * of it by these the most celebrated * of their day charles * and his wife * tree and with * so * that i cried over the tragedy as if my heart would break and laughed with equal * over * the * which followed at the close of the play the * brought her husband into the box and introduced him * her he did all his acting on the stage while she * her * and said what no * we accepted their kind invitation to share their carriage back to the house and enjoyed too some of the * supper prepared for them it was their last year on the stage and i never saw them again though i * their little * given me in exchange for one not half so pretty and * remember the pleasure they put into our lives during the days they were our * among others there came in time that king of * noble in mind as he was perfect in art joe jefferson he was accompanied by his wife a * * little woman the second morning after meeting them i in * to her * about my baby asked after their little dog to whom i had heard her husband talking as if it had been a child she laughed and explained * and told me the story which has since become the property of the newspapers about how the great * had been * to the entire satisfaction of the * by means of this same * the most wonderful dog that ever existed in the human mind nor did this pleasant acquaintance end with our * experience the next time we saw joe jefferson was in richmond where he gave a * and turned over the whole * to a * confederate and all in such a quiet manner as to * the spirit of the * * * the right and left hands the kindness which was shown by the * * the * favorite of fortune to the poor * in the beginning of that career the * of which even then one could * was thus * * a thousand times by the successful * our * made a * of * of all the rooms every * but to us she made her visits longer each time showing a growing interest in our affairs she could not * the * of our having come from such a * home to her * then too one of my * visitors * to be the * and another an english officer they were also a cause of wonder she was so * in this * curiosity that we were compelled to seek a larger house where we should be more lost sight of especially as just at this time two prominent southern gentlemen mr * * and mr * * had been * and taken through the lines though their * was immediately demanded by the english government much to my husbands relief i * to * the * task of * her which notice she seemed * to have anticipated and determined to * by telling of her * all of which she laid at that * her husbands door he is got so * now she said he * to * all the * at night leaves the top floor ones till morning wants to set upstairs with me and the girls instead of * down in the * looking for * and to be * * us to hunt * to * and * and * to drive wont eat the * * * the * * that he * to his girl * on it when he * us coming took money from * too and was that * he was going to spend it on himself and i giving him all he needs taking advantage of her pause for sympathy i * in my notice she immediately put all the * of our going on that johnson and though i assured her that he had nothing whatever to do with it * you cant * us you cant * us he * every * out of the house our next rooms opened on the * de * the * of which in part made up for the loss of the * but not for that of our * who had come and gone making * in our lives cast away this * care come look at the soldiers i said as i saw a shadow in the generals smile and heard a sigh when the music almost under our very windows * the hour for * the * * * of despair * with my * as we stood at the window and watched the soldiers keeping time with them to step and * * while * the * sound within each playing we were * it without one * thought of the * past trying to * each other till we really * ourselves it was with * that i saw the general watch with * interest the * of the soldiers day after day and * welcome * and * our baby learned to march almost before he walked while we were * our * * and each other spite of * * for the future and grief for the past my husband became very ill in the * of his illness while he required all my attention our baby was seized with * the kind old * * by my good friends was very * but failed to * me with my * faith the chief reason i think must have been that he was not called doctor but * for two weeks he came once and sometimes twice a day going first to see and bring me news of baby who had been kindly taken by our friends to their home to be * for i was a * of * * an * * to the english doctor though we were very good friends during all this long illness i never once stopped to consider the cost of anything whether it were food * or * of any kind if * or suggested but * * of * when the danger was past and our board bill was sent up i * over our little store and found there was not enough left to meet it my husband was still too ill to be * or troubled about anything and with the bill hidden away in my pocket i was making a plan of battle and * how i could fight my way out of the * when he noticed that i was looking pale and suggested that i go out for a little fresh air eagerly taking advantage of the excuse thus offered i put on my * and went down to the office and took from my box in the safe an * set of * and asking the * to direct me to the most * * and to send some one to sit with my husband until my return i went out i had had very little experience in * of * and none whatever in * to them but i * great wisdom and dignity as i told the young man who stepped forward to wait upon me that my business was with the head of the firm he took me back to an * office where an old man with * hair and a very * countenance was looking * through something which very much * a * * into his right eye at some * lying on a * before him he wore his teeth on the outside of his mouth and his upper lip was so drawn in the * of his look as to be almost hidden under his * nose his face too was * up into a thousand * in his * upon his work we dont * young women ere he said looking up and * as he suddenly became aware of my presence i came i explained taking out my * and * them to him to ask you if you would not please sir kindly buy some of these * from me or at least advance me some money on them this is not a * * neither * he replied as he carefully * the * and then suddenly * the * out of his eye turned both of the * little gray * upon me and said where did you get these * from miss i was born with them sir i said * either from my appearance or for some other cause he became suddenly * and not only would not * them of me but refused to let me have them till i could prove my right to them i was too young and * to be anything but furious and the bitter * tears that * sometimes * to relieve poor womans * feelings were still falling fast when i reached the hotel with the * whom the * had sent back with me that i might prove by the * my * of the * with which i was born he in his sympathy shared my * and after * his * regret that i should have been * to such an * advised as he * the case from the * with a * look of * * into more * language that i should look carefully over them to be sure that neither this * nor his master had * any of the * for his experience had been that * was born of * as he again locked up my * in his safe he kindly asked how much money i needed and begged that in the future i would permit him to advance for me if i should need any and * as to the board and * here he said mr * and i will * all that when he is well entirely well through the * of god and the skill of my kind

it i * my best clothes assumed a most * * went to the number * and asked to see the professor i was shown into the * of * the kind of room one * so utterly alone in without even the * of a spirit around to keep your own spirit company each piece of furniture was placed with * * and all was * the * who came in * to my call seemed put up in much the same order she was tall and * and her * red

said i will send the professor down to you looking over her * again as if for a * of her first impression of me she was gone returning after a little while she said the professor requested me to ask if you would be so good as to come up into the * i saw as soon as i had entered that a description of me had * my coming and not a very * one either i * from the faces of the professor and the * the class consisted of * young ladies all of them apparently older than i was the professor finished the sentence he was * on the board * it out * his hands on the * * it came forward and was * presented by miss * who remained in the room he had a pleasant round * face a * head and large gray eyes was short and * with a * * voice and manner miss * tells me you came in reply to my * i have been forced to * in order to save time as my going abroad is unexpected and * no delay i am very glad you had no * but to * else it might not have been my good fortune to know of and * to your wants sir and you

surrender he came to the old pickett home to hunt up his friend and former * the generals uncle he asked about the general himself and then for the generals wife i had seen the carriage and the guard and * but did not know who the visitors were in those * times of trouble and anxiety we did not wait for * * and we were following on after the servant who went to answer the bell when i heard the * ask for george picketts wife i came forward with my baby in my arms i am george picketts wife i said and i am * lincoln the president no * lincoln * old friend seeing * * arms mr lincoln took him and little george opened wide his mouth and gave his fathers friend a * baby kiss * to feel with the * * * the * that * as i took my baby back again mr lincoln said in that deep and * voice which was one of his greatest powers over the hearts of men tell your father the * that i forgive him for the sake of your mothers smile and your bright eyes i had sometimes wondered at the generals * way of speaking of president lincoln but as i looked up at his honest earnest face and felt the warm * of his great strong hand i * no more that all who knew him should love him when but a few days later the * flashed over the world the tragic message which * our whole nation in mourning general pickett said my god my god the south has lost her best friend and * the * * hand to guide and * her through the

final * of the * question of states rights a * which had begun away back in the beginning of constitutional history when * and jefferson separated on the question of * of power they laid out a long and * route to a tragic * of the * which began with the failure of the articles of confederation and led up to the * * of the southern members from the * of congress more than half a century later article * in the articles of confederation * that each state * its sovereignty freedom and independence article * * that the said states * * enter into a firm * of friendship with each other the great * of * alexander * was among the first to appreciate the advantage which the state government possessed in the * of the people he * that in a * of state with national interests the state interests would receive the support of the people under the articles of confederation the states had shown more * to take back the powers which had been delegated to the general government than to give up any that might remain the state was the mother of the people the general government was an * * master the * between the state and the individual had become a fixed habit of affection to * the state government would be the act of a * it would even be * should the general government fall to pieces in some sudden political * life would according to the popular view go on much the same as it had always done in certain large affairs of life the people looked to the national government in the small things of * existence they looked to the state the small things are what make up life large events * once or twice in a * small ones * every day the people paid * to the state in return * they shared in the * which were supported by those * they * and * roads for the state they walked and drove over those roads they supported * for the state their children * the * of those * they * the * of the state they looked to the state laws for protection the state officers were their * some of them near and dear friends in them they felt a much stronger personal interest than in the president and cabinet too far away to seem to hold any connection with the mass of the people one of the * to the federal convention had expressed his opinion that the people would be rather more attached to the national government as being more important in itself and more * to their pride * stern old * though he was and somewhat cold as he was regarded yet recognized the fact that with the mass of the people state feeling is * to * national pride even the * * * ambition interest he felt would * with the stream of state power so great was his * of the power of the state over the popular mind that he was almost hopeless of * such * and * interests into one * of states he felt * that only the british form of government would hold together the * * in america had public opinion permitted * to * the state * in * up the national government * upon the constitution which * its existence perhaps more to him than any one else there would have been no question of states rights to * into the * * which it became in a few years after the adoption of the constitution as things remained the states adopted the constitution but the people continued true to the old state * to which they were accustomed in # after peace was established the states from time to time began to grow * of the powers of each other and in # the federal government * upon a * of secession from the articles of confederation of # virginia * reserved the right to withdraw from the compact if she found it against her interest to remain in it as did the ten other states the constitution held each state to be * this * held until # when the * and * laws were passed kentucky and virginia * these laws as contrary to the constitution which was a compact between the states the celebrated virginia and kentucky resolutions followed * that when congress passed acts beyond its constitutional powers the states were not

madison one of the * three to whom the nation was * for its constitution and who might be supposed to know if any man could what that constitution meant the kentucky resolution was prepared by

conclusion of secession president madison was * as a * of powers from which he was * by the constitution from the beginning massachusetts had denied the right of the government to call for troops holding as has since been held in somewhat * * that it was for the governor of the state and not for the president to decide whether there was sufficient reason for calling out state * * island and *

by * * and * and * by * divisions * and * from abroad in the return of peace the causes of * were forgotten and the * question was left to be decided in a different way and at a fearful cost in the

the most dear may we all remember that it can only be * by * the rights of the states and * equally the benefit and burden of the union the word * was first used by jefferson in the kentucky resolution of # in # mr * bill * for a * of duties upon foreign * except where they came in conflict with articles of domestic * was regarded by the south as * upon the country the * system a policy which was favorable to the * of the north but not to the * of the south on the #* of november # the convention called by the legislature of south carolina declared the * act to be * and * and that the state would be * from allegiance to the union if the government should attempt to * the act and would * an independent government the threatened war was * by the efforts of the great * clay who * his

and a farewell separation the last the * of interest which mr madison recognized as one of the leading * of * * of * in * secession and farewell separation was * * in the * of the * convention which met in # at * georgia and afterward at charleston south carolina in this convention a comparison was made between the * * conditions of north and south before and after the union in * times the * of

of the constitution those of south carolina were about the same as in # in the * period of south carolina the difference had increased to an * extent new york had more than * virginia had fallen off * south carolina * there were natural and * causes for a difference in the * * of the two * but making due * for these the convention held that * * was the * cause of their business * the plan of the convention * for the opening of the southern * to trade with foreign * failed this failure though * the effect of northern * of * business * and free labor was yet held by the south to be in great degree due to * * which had resulted in giving * success to the north in * to the south the * facts still remained that in * days the south was the seat of power and that she had now fallen to a * place again in # massachusetts and * proposed a peaceful * of the union as * to remaining a part of a * which * texas in its territory the next year the american * party announced that it was their

carolina to unite the southern states in support of * and to * the president to * congress to * terms of separation if texas should not be admitted one of the resolutions passed at that meeting was that such * could not be * and * effected evidently did not * to any member of the convention according to the * of states rights to which they had been * there was no * reason for making * to such an * at * in the same state it was resolved that we will * this union sooner than * texas at a large meeting in the williamsburg * it was resolved that we hold it to be better and more to the interest of the southern and * * of this confederacy to be out of the union with texas than in it without her for the time this movement was * by * views earnestly * in other parts of the south but the subject was only * to break out later in a more violent form thus all the history of the united states north and south since the adoption of the constitution pointed toward secession as the * for all

soon after the new england states had threatened to * unless the war with great * was * * to them a northern * named * prepared a work known as * on the constitution in this book the right of

rights when * was secretary of war he caused this book to be * in the course of study as pursued at west point where it remained until it was * in 1861 by some other * which presented a different view of the * question for nearly half a century the only * on the constitution ever seen by a west point * was * * on the constitution from which they were taught the principle that at a later period

from norfolk who had been manning the * of that city at two oclock longstreets division with hills marched toward the enemy meeting the advanced troops at three oclock and driving them back to the

sound away from * only four miles distant from the scene of action and bore it to mcclellan lying ill ten miles away who recognized the situation and sent sumner forward to fair * johnston with smith and * was to have made an attack upon the federals right * with longstreets advance but was prevented by his failure to catch the reports of the * fire until it was too late to * fully he then sent smith forward along the * road the sixth north carolina being in advance encountered the federal skirmishers and drove them back as johnston rode on with hoods brigade he stopped near fair * to witness a contest between smith and a body of federal infantry supported by a battery but * that smith was able to hold his ground he sent hood on to join longstreet and attack the right flank of the

mill was made by george e * r h andersons brigades alone general longstreet in a letter to general robert e lee written a year after the close of the war says of this battle general pickett was severely wounded and was kept out of the field until september of that year when he joined his brigade at martinsburg virginia though even then he was unable to wear the * of his coat upon that arm immediately upon his return to the field general pickett was assigned to the command of a division and on the * of october 1862 was * majorgeneral general picketts severe wound * * him to leave the

oak swamp and for * to come up along the charles city road jackson not being able to cross the swamp and * being * down the road by * battery they did not reach the field as expected hearing the sound of cannon toward the charles city road longstreet supposed that * was approaching and returned the supposed signal this drew fire from the federal batteries which * * president davis who had come upon the field to * with his generals as the president was not prepared to take an active part in the fight he was carried off with all possible speed to a place of safety colonel jenkins with his * of

regiment led by colonel robert * longstreet says of this general he was more * of his battle than any one who came within my experience during the war if i except d h hill at sharpsburg the next day meeting surgeon * of * division who had remained upon the field to * the wounded longstreet said well * is safe in richmond and if his division had not offered the * resistance it did on this road we would have captured your whole army never mind we will do it yet it was in this fight at * farm three days after the battle of * mill in which general pickett had been wounded that his only brother his * * * * major charles pickett was almost * wounded though major pickett * escaped death and reported for duty at a period far in advance of the * of the most * of those who knew of his terrible

in this battle at * farm major charles pickett received not only the highest praise from his comrades but favorable official mention from his * officers in his report of the battle colonel strange says the battle the little major fought down at * farm the soldiers called it at the time and they still * in their hearts the glorious memory of that brilliant fight major pickett was the best loved officer in the brigade and every soldier there would * have followed him to death * the major did not die under the flag he so loved that death would have been welcome if * by its folds he yet lives to * the hearts of his comrades by the touch of his friendly hand and the sound of the voice which * them on to * deeds in the old heroic days at the battle of * hill picketts brigade with the rest of longstreets corps was held in reserve this was the last of the seven days battles which had resulted as general lee in his return of thanks to his army july # expressed it in the relief of richmond from a state of * the * of the great army that so long * its safety the taking of many thousand prisoners including officers of high rank the capture or destruction of stores to the value of * and the * of thousands of arms and forty pieces of superior artillery some one has said that the first battle of bull run gave such great satisfaction to the audience that an * was demanded the federal

when that officer reached the field he was placed on the right of jackson picketts brigade was on longstreets right with the remainder of * division it was one of the brigades * the advance of hood and * which resulted in the victory for that day a piece of artillery several * * and a number of prisoners being taken the morning of the 30th was given to a heavy artillery combat between colonel s

john porter in the magnificent charge which finally * the field and won victory for the confederate arms picketts men proved their * as * as they had done when they followed their own leader who was * his gallant soul * under the sad necessity which kept him off the field lee again sent jackson to secure a position between pope and the capital but pope having * this movement fell back to * where he was attacked by jackson on the 1st of september here the federal army lost the brilliant general * * who rode within the confederate lines and was shot in * to escape * had been a * * in * where his *

useful purpose of a cigar * until it * to be left behind in camp where it was found by a * federal soldier on the morning of september 13th it was placed in the hands of mcclellan and in the afternoon

to be surrendered at that moment lee resolved to stand and meet the enemy at sharpsburg had lee made a battlefield for himself he probably could not have * a more * one than that which he had chosen

ruin the army of the potomac if burnside would attack such a * * position it was * to suppose that he would repeat his * the next day this would seem to indicate that lee and his generals had a * sense of the military * of their adversary lee himself was too * to leave his strong position and * to the open plain to attack upon a * a * foe who might suddenly change from * to * so the two armies watched each other in * silence until the night of the 15th when the army of the potomac * the * of war in * picketts division was composed of * * * * and * virginia brigades and * formerly r h andersons south carolina brigade the division as a division was on a field of battle for the first time december # 1862 at the battle of fredericksburg where it held in reserve the * of longstreets corps and though it was eager and * to be allowed to take part in the fight it was never fully reached general longstreet gave instructions to his division commanders pickett and hood simply to hold their ground in defense unless they should see an opportunity to attack the enemy while engaged with a p hill on the right pickett saw this opportunity when * column advanced on the extreme right just a little beyond their front thus leaving the enemys flank open and * it out to hood suggested that it was the * time and that they should at once turn their forces upon * column in the open field through which they were forced to pass general pickett in person made the suggestion to hood * out the * of the movement and the * of the men in * to be allowed to take apart and urged that they should * themselves of the * * of the * left them by longstreet hood perfectly agreed with pickett as to the * and * of the attack but being more * and * of * responsibility than pickett insisted upon first sending a brief of their * to general longstreet who was with general lee in another part of the field watching the progress of the battle asking him if in the * circumstances they should not at once * in with their divisions any delay at such a moment was of course * and before the * of general longstreet was obtained and the order given the opportunity was lost the strength of the division at the time of its * was about nine thousand though only a part of one brigade of the division * was * engaged in this their first battle as a division the battle of fredericksburg the * of the battle as a division were of course * but enough alas to make many a heart * many a * desolate about forty seven wounded dead and dying were found near the stone * at * hill the * federal commander burnside was bold determined and fierce in his attack and had he been drawn still * into the * which had been set for him on this field of battle by our general lee it is more than probable that his whole army would have been destroyed general lees position was so * and so thoroughly * that general * attack was repulsed with great loss at every point only a portion of lees first line near * crossing was driven back by * daring assault upon it but even that ground lee at once recovered picketts division remained * in the rear * the rappahannock river below fredericksburg then it was removed to the left to meet * attempted crossing at * ford in the early part of february 1863 it started out on longstreets expedition to * virginia and north carolina marching to richmond and thence to the

this * is recalled to show that picketts men marched into the very * of death with the full knowledge that they were offering up their lives on the altar of duty after the war general pickett said that he did not believe there was a man in his dear old division who did not know when he heard the order that in * it he was marching to death yet every man of them marched forward * it was one oclock the solemn silence which had * over the field was suddenly * by a cannon shot a minute passed the washington artillery again sent its * message * through the valley and * and * from the * while

* thunder and * ever * this * * the valley was filled with clouds of dust and * smoke a * sea of white and * and gray * * its * to and fro between the heights and * out the * of the sun the fierce flames from the guns flashed through * the dark * like * * in a * battle of the clouds fiery * shot across the field leaving death and * in their * * flying * * the air shells burst above troops or * up the ground and * off for another deadly strike the confederate line remained steady although it was exposed to the fire of the enemy which passed over the artillery and struck the infantry with terrible effect the ammunition was * the artillery combat must be closed after two hours the firing ceased for half an hour silence settled over the * field during which time the confederates were rapidly forming an * column just below the brow of seminary ridge long double lines of infantry came * out of the woods and * across * and little * * on to the positions assigned them in the column two separate lines of double ranks were formed a hundred yards apart and in the * of this column were the * of the three brigades of picketts division * brigade the * * * * and * virginia * * brigade

picketts advance as * division passed on it was to be joined by * brigade then about two hundred yards in front anderson was behind the two * divisions ready to take * place when he should leave it pickett rode up to longstreet for orders the latter seemed greatly * and said i do not want to have your men * pickett so i have sent a note to alexander telling him to watch carefully the effect of our fire upon the enemy and that when it * to tell he must take the responsibility and * you himself when to make the attack he has been directed to charge with you at the head of your line with a battery of nine * * fresh horses and full * just as longstreet finished this statement a * rode up and handed pickett a note from alexander which * gave orders to his brigade commanders and rode along down the line his men * to their feet with a * of delight as he told them what was expected of them he was sitting on his horse when * rode up taking a * from his pocket * said pickett take a drink with me in an hour * be in * or glory pickett declined to drink saying i promised the little girl who is waiting and praying for me down in virginia that i would keep fresh upon my lips until we should meet again the breath of the violets she gave me when we parted whatever my fate * i shall try to do my duty like a man and i hope that by that little girls prayers i shall today reach either glory or glory at a quarter past three on that bright afternoon the order forward rang along the lines the supreme moment had come as far as the eye could reach up and down on each side the gaze of thousands of men of both armies was * on a long line of soldiers moving with all the * of a grand review the five thousand * had begun their march to death longstreet joined alexander and they stood together by the batteries when that magnificent column went by the officers * as they passed pickett led mounted on his * * gallant and graceful as a * of * riding to a * his long dark * hair floated

spread a * * around those devoted men the long federal * with its double line of * was revealed to view as the advancing column came in sight meades guns opened upon it but it neither paused nor * round shot * along * through its ranks and * around it shells * * * before behind * a long line of skirmishers * on the grass suddenly arose within fifty yards firing at them as they came within view

shot and shell pickett gave the order left * * and * the movement was made * the direction * * from the front to the left from cemetery hill burst the fire of forty cannon against the right flank picketts men fell like * before the * of the * there was no pause the * pressed on with a force which seemed to have grown stronger with the * of all the lives which had been * from the fallen brave

and * * of * * as they advanced toward cemetery hill there was seen in the open field to the right a long dark line of men half a mile distant and at right * with their line they were coming at * upon that * right flank their * at right shoulder * their * * in the * their * * * in the sun the enemy were * their position * up * from right to left and from opposite * * along the confederate front a heavy rain of shell and * poured down from the height in the fiery storm the thin ranks became yet * not an * * * but under the * fire they marched steadily forward * men * we are almost there cried * * voice above the roar of battle then he went down among the dead with the faith of a little child in his hero heart there was a * * of armed men from behind then a rush of * feet and * brigade from the rear closed up behind the front line their gallant leader with his hat on the point of his sword took * place the division was now four ranks deep as often as the iron storm made * through it the cheer would come from private * * lieutenant and captain alike close up close up and forward the lines * but never * never halted closer and closer they drew to the foe till there remained only a * * now they broke forward into a * while * and * * and * through the air on on they rushed toward the stone wall where the federal batteries were * forth their deadly * a hundred yards away a * force came down on a run halted suddenly and fired into the line a deadly storm of * under this * they * and * between falling comrades and the right came pressing down upon the * making the line at this point twenty to thirty deep a few unable to resist * without orders * the enemy on their right though the latter were sixty to one the fighting was * * seemed to cross men fired to the right and to

the way to glorious victory or not less glorious defeat three thousand five hundred had gone down to the soldiers * death to live forever in our hearts and on the * pages of their * history virginia

at gettysburg where were the guns when picketts men started on their grim march to death is a * which has been often made and to which colonel e p alexander is perhaps best * to give answer to this received following reply which is still in my possession i felt the responsibility very deeply for the day was rapidly advancing about twelve or a little later and whatever was to be done was to be done soon meanwhile i had been * * the attack with general a b * who said that the difficulty was not so much in reaching cemetery hill or taking it his brigade had carried it the afternoon before but that the trouble was to hold it for the whole federal army was * in a sort of * * and could rapidly * the point to any extent while our long * line could not give prompt enough support this somewhat * me as i had heard it said that morning that general lee had ordered every brigade in the army to charge cemetery hill and it was at least certain that the question of * had had his careful attention before * i rode back to * with general pickett whose line was now formed or forming in the wood and without telling him of the question i had to decide i found out that he was entirely * of success in the charge and was only * himself on * i was * that to make any * effort would * a failure of the campaign and that if our artillery fire was once opened after all the time * in preparation for the attack the only hope of success was to follow it up promptly with one extreme effort * every energy we possessed into it and my mind was fully made up that if the artillery opened pickett must charge wrote to longstreet there have been many efforts to * responsibility and to * various causes to this * of the army of northern virginia but i can not find it in my heart nor do i think it * to believe that any man or officer of that grand army led by the * lee did * but what the most profound sense of duty and patriotism * by the * which surrounded him suggested that he should do general * * an interview with lee after the battle states that in a voice * with emotion lee said after a moment he added in a tone almost of agony a report of the closing scene of the great battle was made by him who was best able to give the true story of picketts charge at gettysburg it was prepared from notes * on the * of old letters on * of * on any * large enough to hold a sentence they were * down amid the dead faces * the line of retreat the * of the wounded and dying all the fearful * and sounds of that death march they are the memories of a man only a few days away from the most * * of his life this report was * at the request of the commanderinchief * down by the responsibility of a great army lee * from * to the difficulties of the position by any * which might be excited by a bare statement of facts in a kind and * letter which has become a part of the published records of the war * the truth of the report he asked that it might be withdrawn * after * forth the reasons for his request the * words we have the enemy to fight it was in a spirit of true patriotism that the leader of the army of northern virginia made this request those who knew him will remember that of all his many noble * none was more * than this duty is the * word in human language his duty was to the cause for which he fought and in the * of that duty he asked that this thing might be done his wishes were * then and through all the years that have passed since that time they have not been forgotten the most * * have not brought that report from the * to which it was * in the * past the hand which * those * notes reaching from the grave is as powerful as when it * the sword upon the field of battle and it * across them still the mark of silence they are all our own they who went down in the * they who left the field with heavy hearts and * steps * to stay behind with their comrades who had passed beyond the conflict our tried and true our * may the soft veil of mercy and love * them forever the * of the summer of 1863 seemed to keep * with the high * of war the heat was so * that the * were closed early the first week in june i was * from my * * i stopped in richmond for a few days en route to my home within the federal lines the day after i arrived i received a letter * at culpeper courthouse june # full of faith in a successful campaign a short separation and a * * of the difficulties june # and # there came other letters one written on the march to winchester the other after reaching that place * the same spirit of confidence and hope until the fatal third of july such letters came to me * hope and trust always hope and trust then * to us * faint and * at first of a great battle fought at gettysburg gradually they grew stronger and * and the mind of the south became * with the impression that a grand victory had been won thus the news first came to us * in the * air of the south from the * disaster it really was into the glorious triumph which our * hearts hoped it might be a few days of this * dream and then the * truth i could hear nothing of the general except the * * that he had been killed in the final charge our * * were very * and our letters were * through the lines by any * person who having been given the privilege of going back and forth happened to be at hand at the time many a mile i had * on * hoping to hear directly from the general before i was * * our old * had been a * not only to us but to the whole county every other * and every horse had been * and taken by the federals but for his wonderful memory * would have changed * too like all his * and sisters for he was a * * when a * his * had been broken in crossing a bridge and all the powers of * and * and * after that accident could not make him step on a plank much less cross a bridge unless you * to * the bridge and first walked across it yourself in safety and then came back and led him over my last ride on * brought me as * a * of five or six letters the first was the letter which the general as he went into battle had handed to general longstreet with its sad * if * * means death the next was written on the second day after the great * later there came to me the following two weeks later i received this letter perhaps no girl just out of school ever had a more difficult * * upon her than that which * me had we been living under the old * nothing would have been * than to prepare for a grand wedding in the stately old southern style times had changed very greatly in the past few years and how was a * to be made away up in the * north where all the pretty things seemed to have gone and * through the lines to make a wedding brilliant enough to * the * idea of * and yet how could a marriage take place without the * of white * * * * * and * and all the other * * connected with that interesting event in a young womans life however if love * at * he has more serious * of * other * in his way and all the difficulties of * were finally * but still there were * in the path longstreet lay under a tree at culpeper courthouse * * from the * which would * * upon the mind of a man in whose care was the * of the leading corps of the army of northern virginia as he * * pickett came up and sat on the grass beside him general he said i am going to be married and want a * this little girl * my picture to general longstreet says she is ready and willing to marry me at any minute in spite of the * of war and will go with me to the * end of the earth if need be the * man had * the older about many things since the day when he had rushed forward into the place made * by the * of his superior officer and carried the flag to victory but he had never before * to him an * of so * and sacred a character longstreet considered the matter * for a time i cant give it to you pickett they are not * any * now i might * you for special duty and of course you could stop off by the way and be married said general longstreet with a * in his eye it was not a time for * upon * details even in regard to very * subjects and the general eagerly * to be * for special duty then there arose the * of how to get the two necessary parties to the * within the * * to each other if the general attempted to cross the lines he might be arrested and then not only would the wedding be * * but one of the divisions of longstreets corps would lose its leader the general had * coming to meet me at the * river which was the * line between the federal and confederate forces but fortunately through military * his plans were changed as * as we had tried to be the federals by some unknown power caught a * of what was expected and some poor fellow en route to the * as innocent of being the general as of * * was * and captured by a * of cavalry sent out from * for the purpose and though he * innocent to the charges against him put into * * before he was recognized and * thus in the interests of the confederacy as well as of the marriage it became necessary that i should be the one to cross the lines my uncle was a physician and because of his * was permitted to go where he wished and i had often accompanied him on his * visits on the #* of september my father and i set out to cross the lines under the * wing of this good uncle just before we were * over the * river we came upon the federal cavalry who looked at us somewhat * but * dr * evidently assumed that he was bent upon a mission of mercy as indeed was he not and did not * us we reached the * in safety * it was called and the * * * around the name filled my youthful fancy with pleasure there we were met by my uncle colonel j j * and his wife and by the generals brother and his aunt and uncle miss * and mr * johnston colonel * was a warm personal friend of the general and commanded a regiment in his division he had been wounded at gettysburg and was just * they accompanied us to petersburg where to my great delight the general awaited me at the station when we reached the hotel he and my father went out for the purpose of * the * they soon returned with the * * that * to some * * the * could not be issued without a special * of court i not being a * of that * court could not be * until the next day and the general must report at headquarters that evening he went away * and i fell into a * of tears thereby greatly * the * rigid * lady a friend of my mother who had accompanied me as * and * and who was * * by the expression of my * and the general * of my conduct in * over the delay as i sat in my room * in grief i heard the * crying the evening papers all about the marriage of general pickett the hero of gettysburg to the beautiful miss * of virginia you know a girl is always beautiful on her * whatever she may have been the day before or will be the day after however it was not my * but only was to have been and i had serious * as to whether my * * eyes and disappointed grief * face would be * to answer * * * of the highest * of beauty again was my mothers * and * friend * * as i thought because i had simply opened the window to buy a paper containing the account of my own marriage the next day the general returned to petersburg and the court * * the * was granted and we were married by the * dr * in dear old st * church before * thousands for soldier and * rich and poor high and low were all made welcome by my hero we left for richmond on the afternoon train * the * of guns * cheers and * and * and * it may not be supposed that in those dark days of the confederacy we were * to find a * * awaiting us in the capital but we did the river and the woods had given of their * * to do honor to my general it was in the * season and so * was that game * that the * was afterward known as the * had it required the * of ammunition to provide this * it would probably have been * for the south at that time could not afford to * at birds when there were so many more important * to be found they were killed at night with * and many * were sent as * * by the plantation servants from * island there were thousands of * * * and * of * * made and * * and made into * too by the faithful old plantation servants under the * of mrs * the loyal old * wife not having * we had few * but mrs robert e lee had made for us with her own fair hands a beautiful * the generals * mrs * * the mother of the present * sent us as a * * a * that had been made and * away for her own golden wedding and some of our other friends had remembered us in similar ways so we even had * at our wedding supper it was a brilliant reception the army of northern virginia then stationed around richmond came in uniform of the thousands present only president davis and his cabinet a few * and a few very old men were in * clothes the general and i greeted and * them all as they came then they passed on to the * and the dance * as only richmond in the confederacy could dance with a step that never * she * * over the * of a * she * graceful * on the * of the * the * of the coming * struck no * tones into her merry music if people could not dance in the * of life the tragedy of existence might be even * than it is so they * through the beautiful bright september night and when the last guests were going my general and i walked out upon the * with them and as they closed the * * watched the stars of night * away before the coming dawn and the morning star rise and * * upon a new happy day after the battle of gettysburg longstreet placed before the secretary of war a proposition to take his corps to tennessee to * bragg it was the intention that pickett should accompany this expedition a plan which drew from the corps commander the following words of * and * longstreets proposed plan was * by the changed orders which

this town * a few miles south of * river where it * * sound had been captured in 1862 by an expedition led by burnside and was now occupied by * hundred men under command of * pickett now * that too much time had been * and that the delay of this * which delay had had its * with the authorities at richmond rendered the execution of the plan at this late hour both * and * he held that * as danger

authorities at richmond giving no * to picketts warning and taking no * of his * in behalf of petersburg he in his * sent a special * with a * letter to general lee who was then on the rapidan with the army of northern virginia telling him of his * repeated * and * and of his * interview with the secretary of war general pickett pointed out to general lee the extreme danger to the confederacy at that point and the * of further * general lee by return * wrote as follows beauregard was then in command around charleston south carolina without loss of time he and pickett met by appointment at * north carolina pickett laid before beauregard the letter of general lee and explained the * critical condition of affairs the * * of the immediate attack of the federals on this the most * approach to the capital of the confederacy and the * of any force which he had at his command to * such an attack beauregard expressed himself at once as being in perfect * of sentiment with pickett * to the * of all he said he * his * and assistance and promised to * pickett as speedily as possible with whatever troops he could spare upon picketts return to petersburg he found that in the face of all * in

and around richmond lee said it was not his intention that this attack on * hundred should be carried to such an extent but he was so delighted and * with the result and so proud of the * and daring

* * was appointed reader for the * its our turn now the generals wife said we were to have lees * next one would cry out * it is too good a book to be * around in this way to the men said a * * * over the many * * for after the * * and * the men began in turn as they read it to write their * till every space * * every spot in fact where the * could find room * name a word a thought was covered let them have the book and mark it all they want to for nothing is too good for the poor * said the general as he * read aloud these * notes * lincoln * has called for a * of men and jeff davis says war to the * what shall we do and again we sadly miss thy green * dear old * with which thy fields did once so * and which did * help us in our efforts to draw up our * to the * of our rations as our * * british * so we shall resist the assault upon our constitutional freedom and the sovereignty of the states of the confederacy i have the old book now and in comparison with it the most * * de * of * * ever sent out by * * to * the eye of the * is of no value whatever * * was one of the few books published in charleston and was * on paper * in the confederacy the general sent on and bought for his men a number of * of it and of several other books published at that time one of my greatest * was to ride along the lines with the general the easy graceful movement of my horse the * * the * of color in a late autumn flower which had escaped the tramp of heavy feet the * cheers of the men as they saw us coming all helped to make me lose sight for a moment of the awful cause of our being there one morning as we rode along the * house line i saw a * of smoke rise in the distance * * becoming a mere * as it floated higher and higher until it was lost against the blue sky how pretty that smoke is i said the general looked at it * then said * yes * beautiful it is from a shell the enemy have begun firing again come * better ride on as fast as you can and let me get you beyond the danger no no general i could not do that i replied with something of the * which a soldier might have felt upon being * to run away from battle never never in the wide world would i let picketts men see your wife riding fast to get away from danger as we rode slowly along amid the cheers of the soldiers looking as * over at the * * columns of smoke as if they were * clouds captain smith rode up they are not firing at us he said * me and * the general they are * their guns i think for the * of mrs grant who i learn has this morning come down to the lines she is just over there as you see looking on * us his glass nevertheless our position is not a safe one a * ball might * strike us here would it not be better for you to take mrs pickett away turn to the left into that * of trees she will not go said the general and i can not issue a military order as i might in the case of any other * the only * captain of having a wife is that whatever place you may hold on the army * she * you thus we sat our horses in the glory of the * southern morning and * * of anything everything * what came to us on the * wings of the passing moment while the guns over on the enemys lines troubled the air with their * roar the * of smoke * their * of * grace to the * the * were * they * nothing but the helpless and * earth which was * where they fell it was a * of war the captain bade us * lifted his hat and rode on in advance riding in that graceful way which the * has by * from a long line of * who have been accustomed to ride over wide * of land i watched him as he rode on then my heart in terror stands still even now as i * try to record the dread sight the * horse dashed on down the lines bearing a * body one of the * * alas had found a mark when i returned to the * hundred lines bringing back with me our blessed little baby there was none of the * and * of war though richmond and petersburg were one large camp of soldiers day by day the north was growing stronger the south * a number of picketts men had learned of our expected arrival and when the general thinking the secret of our coming was all his own * on horseback from a * of trees near the * he found colonel * with his band * from the different regiments the members of his staff and some of the brigade and * officers there before him waiting to welcome the new little soldier who was coming to share with him and them the * of their * as the old train * slowly into the station * band struck up see the * hero comes and cheer after cheer went up for the generals baby for whom * had been lighted * days before while the happy father was riding hastily into richmond to welcome his little * son he could stay only a few hours and when leaving he leaned over the * * god for the blessing of our precious little baby and put into his * hand the following * and * the general with bowed head and hat in hand in grateful * of this delicate expression of the love of his comrades in coming to * us rode on past them and * the train just before it reached the station as soon as he handed us off his men surrounded us eager to take a * into the great * of * which * from view their little general as they then * him we were hurried into the carriage too soon for some at least of the dear soldiers one whose name was young and who as the general told me afterward had been wounded in the battle of june # coming near losing his head which was just * by a ball took george * * * from my arms and held him up to the * gaze of his comrades with many a word of love and blessing our baby was passed on down the line from one to another tenderly almost * they touched him our blessed baby and many a * was dropped on the pillow upon which his * black mammy to * his safety had carefully fastened him meanwhile the young hero in wise and * silence with closed eyes and * * received the love and * thrust upon him he may have made faces but not a sound did he utter as he passed on in this his first review no picketts baby * left the rebel * for picketts men to make i am ashamed to confess it but notwithstanding the * of the soldiers * quiet peaceful * and the generals continued assurance that he was all right i his very new and * mother suffered * of * and anxiety until he was back again in my arms and oh dear what a * * * little * it was when i did get it back one would hardly have recognized the * baby of a few minutes before nor was the * * the only price the little general had to pay for honor and glory there were other * our poor army for want of * and clothes had superior numbers of * as well as * to fight and this enemy put our young general through his first contest and in spite of our raising the black flag and of the * heroic and immediate * of surgeon mother and nurse it was many days before our * * soldier recovered from the * received in his first battle our army at this time * about forty to fifty thousand was holding a line from a point north of fort harrison on the north side of the james to * creek south of petersburg several miles in length * on all sides by the federal army the confederates were in constant fear that grant would at any moment * around our right and shut us up in richmond and petersburg to * he had possession of the * road and was threatening the richmond and * railroad our only remaining line * us with the southern states from which we received our supplies the line from * house on the james river opposite * gap * across to * creek and fort * on the appomattox a distance of about three miles was held by picketts division which * between four and five thousand men our line was so drawn out when thrown into the trenches that it made scarcely more than a strong * while the federal lines were full picketts men worked hard to make their position a strong one and were always on the * * for an assault at many points the confederate and federal lines were so close together that the soldiers of the two armies could talk to each other in an ordinary tone of voice could exchange newspapers * for coffee and so on the * confederates frequently made * of the federal * once * their line of * for more than a hundred yards and taking a hundred and * prisoners on one occasion the leader of the southern band had been promised some * in exchange for some confederate bonds and at the appointed time went out * between the lines for the proposed exchange when they separated the federal * handed to him a roll of paper on * our lines he found the papers to be a * of general b f butler offering to * twenty dollars in * or * in the * or * department of the army or navy or * to their homes if within the federal lines there was a promised * for the * * of these papers but the loyal * brought them to headquarters where they were all destroyed except two one of which i have after this * efforts were made by the officers to break up all social * the * and devotion of the soldiers of picketts division in the defense of their homes and * as an * * right had drawn them very near to each other the humanity and * of these soldiers was a beautiful * as a class they were free from * * and * * one of the sad * of the first two years of the war had disappeared the religious spirit * in the division by dr * at * in 1863 when * of the soldiers * christ seemed still to * now and again in passing along in the rear of the * the ragged * confederate would be seen on his knees * out his soul to his blessed * and * his blessing on our cause and his * care for the loved ones at home our * were as * as they were * many being wounded and killed in battle the * general pendleton chief of artillery who at the first battle of manassas would say as he led his men on lord have mercy on their souls fire men fire often prayed and * for the division * j taylor * organized a young * christian association and was one of the most earnest of the * in the cause of * it was * that whenever religious services were held almost every man off duty would be in * many of these soldiers who i have heard were wild * and some of them * have since become * and three that i know of are now * they needed too poor fellows all the comfort that * could bring for these were dark and trying days every turn of the * reduced the supplies and increased the * of the * confederacy the price of the * of life had * to such an * height that the soldiers pay of eleven dollars a month was not sufficient to buy a * of * his rations were a fourth of a * of * one * of * * with now and then a * of * a few * or * or a little * no * coffee or * it took sixty of our dollars to buy one * in gold one * of * cost * dollars a * of bread two dollars * cotton and * six dollars a yard shoes from one to three hundred dollars a pair but the * of * and the * of the battlefield were nothing to the poor soldier in comparison with the almost certain knowledge that his wife and children and mother were cold and hungry what wonder is it then devoted though they were to their cause that there should yet be some * from their ranks the following incident will show what excuse mercy if not justice might * in their defense one morning when my nurse returned from the * pen where i had sent her with a * of * * for its poor * * she told me that the guard said that one of the men in the pen was from my home and knew me and that he had been * to be allowed to send me a letter go back at once i said * and tell the guard to get the letter and give it to you to bring to me she soon returned bringing a * tied up in * on the * was written for the generals wife when i am

after his * the box and letters were directed to his mother and wife the * letter was written on both sides of the paper one side was written to me on the other side was a letter from his wife as

returned to his duty under his flag * of the danger of meeting a * * death i went into the next room where the general and colonel harrison were working over a * and handed the letter to the general as he read it his great glorious gray eyes filled with tears * me for what i had done he gave the letter to colonel harrison well said the colonel as he returned the letter there is nothing to be done about it dear lady these miserable * have got to be shot in the morning and all your pretty play is pretty play they have been tried by court * their sentence * and the general has nothing on earth to do with it and cant help it you and lady h not only look very much alike but you are very much alike * and the * of the service demand a rigid * of military laws said the general i knew my generals great generous heart and i knew that those men would not be shot the next morning before sunrise the execution of the sentence was * three days afterward an order came from richmond * all * in spite of the * gloom the fall of fort * the * of tennessee by hoods army * march to charleston danger * and cold picketts men were * and full of faith all through the winter the men had been in the trenches

* the * of the division became so absorbed that before he knew it he was taken prisoner such an immense man was mr * with such an * foot that special orders had to be given to the * for his shoes and

the federals demanded four of their men for our mr * to which demand we gladly * the last of january the peace commissioners appointed by the confederate government to meet the representatives of the

peace to our common country this * had not a * to * the way to a * conference lincoln appointed seward to meet the representatives of the confederate government and in his letter of instructions said as the first meeting of seward with the confederate commissioners was not successful lincoln was induced by grant to go in person to meet the southern representatives mr * set forth the theory that secession was the best * for sectional * as this view was not * received he suggested a union for the purpose of * the french from mexico lincoln and seward agreed with him as to the * of the new * * but thought the united states government able to drive them away mr lincoln would * only on the * of * and the abolition of slavery mr * report * the following the president said he could not * with

seward all that he distinctly recalled about charles l was that he lost his head of this conference which took place february # 1865 on board the river queen lincoln thus made report to congress the news of the * * of the peace commission soon spread through the whole army and hope died in all hearts anxious faces indicated the deep sorrow with which the failure of the conference was regarded it was possible that the leaders might know of a * of foreign * of which the army was ignorant unless this was true nothing was left but to fight it out to the bitter end after the failure of the peace commission was known there was held in general picketts tent a * of the officers of his division as they talked their words * out to me said one we must hush all hope of peace in our hearts with the cry of war to the * all * and * must be driven into the army i believe the yankees * tired of war as we are another suggested why not free the negroes they would be as loyal to us if we * them as to our enemies who can give them certainly no more than we can unless it is better rations and pay but their love for us and the confidence they have in us will more than * that certainly * another they are no * than our own sons we are willing to sacrifice our sons our fathers and ourselves why not our property is our property * than our own lives another said i believe the great * of the army is ready to make any sacrifice for our separate existence as a people and the cause of liberty as our * * british * we must resist northern * said another our object is not the negro but independence and a separate government for which i am willing to * slavery and give up any and every thing else with such patriotism such * * said the general our independence shall be accomplished the north is turning the southern negro into northern bonds and i too believe that the majority of the army want to free the negro and make him help us to work i know that the majority of picketts men favor it we shall lose everything else if we attempt to preserve and * slavery and in the end of course lose that it should have been done in 1863 well at any * it was agreed the last hope of peace save that which follows in the * of the * is over for the south the last winter of the confederacy had been one of * * and painful anxiety the end was drawing near the march winds and * of the previous days had * themselves to sleep and march had * from her sister month one of her * most beautiful days for this the last review on this side of the dark waters of the grand old virginia division of picketts men i was on horseback beside the general * * this last review of his beloved command the order to march was handed to the general just after the first brigade had passed on when the last man had passed in review and the last * had been given and * the order to march was read and published there was not a man in the whole division who did not feel the * of * this * who did not know that it was then but a mere * of the few days and weeks which would * until the end yet without a * these brave men received marching orders sheridan the * and * with his ten thousand cavalry had * early at * and * his little band of three thousand men and was on his way to richmond it was reported * * from the north and the command was moving up to richmond and to the * line of * north of the city pickett was to go and look after him we should take away with us many sacred memories of our * camp life the years of common suffering of * each others * and bearing each others * had bound us all together by the most sacred and loyal of * till comrade seemed to me a closer * * than brother the camp was broken the last review of picketts division was over our baby the little general with * * had been sent on ahead with his faithful mammy two hours in advance of my departure i was waiting ready to start i had listened to the tramp of regiment after regiment as they in turn folded their * and marched away the * of the * were growing * and * in the distance as we caught sight of lucy with her * coat and * eyes full of tenderness and fire and her * * * and small * feet as she * over the field with blood as blue as that of her * * tom friend one of the generals * was riding behind him they were coming back from the front for me * promptly brought up my horse which was * and waiting i mounted and * forward to meet the general as we rode slowly away he looked * and sadly around him and sighed a farewell to tent and camp of * house * and the lines of breastworks this position important as the main line of defense between richmond and petersburg and * any advance by the federals he had occupied since the #* of may 1864 through the soft * and * and the * breath of the dawn of the year we rode away from our first and last camp and on together to the old pickett home in richmond where the general was to leave me and * his division he said * and as we * beside our * * we placed each other in gods holy keeping take care of * my little man if papa should not come back i leave her to you my dear dear little * son ask * to tell you what papa says and if there there he said * i must go now smiles come smiles give me smiles no tears mind and he went out of the door and down the steps two at a time * the girl i left behind me a little while later i heard the * * and * nurse rushed in to say i * away my tears caught up my baby who had just * * from the * hand the * of white violets which she said she had * * * * * * * * what * * marse * * had * de year * she * sick an die and ran down the steps to the gate the division halted as it drew near when its leader came to say * i closed * hands over the * of white violets and held it out to him he carried the * * away with him as the division marched forward * three cheers for the little general and his mother ten years later brown and * with time the * * of violets went down to the grave with all that was * of the soldier who carried them in their sweet * and * * at the head of his brave * is a * service to record the gathering gloom of the last days of the confederacy when the * blood of the * * the mother clay as her sons * gave up their lives gun in hand and faces forward where their officers led the officers feeling as they gave the order how vain alas it all was to us who lived through the darkness of those days there is yet a black shadow falling around us like the memory of an awful dream poor confederacy she had nothing to * to the * of resources possessed by the enemy save the * * of her children who fought against such * as had never before stood in the way of freedom when pickett received and * the telegram from lee * him to move to the right of petersburg he knew and his men knew that it was a * hope no cheek * no * * as the order was read there was no * of their proud resolution to fight the battle for principle through sacrifice however vain to the end as i * * record these last days i * lay the * * of gratitude prayer love and tears * on the sacred grave of these last men who * brave died for the land they could not save pickett received the order from lee on the 29th day of march 1865 at * creek where he with two of his brigades * and * were * stuarts brigade was west of petersburg and was ordered to join pickett en route * brigade the brave old command at the head of which garnett met his glorious death on the field of gettysburg was with longstreet on the north of the james river the entire division had been ordered to march but it was found that there was * for only three brigades in order to secure a whole division longstreet suggested drawing * from * hundred and * pickett to * him but lee preferred a part of picketts division and ordered the three brigades forward pickett in carrying out the order of lee * to make the movement as * as possible though he knew it was impossible to * entirely from the knowledge of the federals the action of stuarts brigade near petersburg it being in the range of vision from the federal * pickett with the brigades of * * and stuart was to cross the appomattox river passing petersburg where they were to take the cars by the * railroad to * station ten miles west of * * and to move thence to * tavern on the railroad fitz lees cavalry had already * the infantry to the tavern and he had from that point * with pickett who * the three brigades reached the station a little after nine oclock in the evening at ten oclock the same night the 29th r h anderson sent an order to pickett to come on with his three brigades by a * to the white oak road over * run and take a position to the right of * * * division at the extreme right of the confederate line the roads and * were almost * but picketts * men without a * moved on through the * rain over the * roads * * and * pickett with his * * led them on ever and * * among them his * * smile * many a * * to step out with a * face and a * * as he would pass on * with his * beautiful * * the * blue flag maryland * * the girl i left behind me or some other familiar air equally dear to the soldiers heart or with a word of good cheer he would wave his cap and go on leaving the air behind him radiant with sympathy and affection the presence of the born leader of soldiers is as strong and * in * and * * as it is * in battle about * of the 30th with the rain still * pickett with his command arrived upon the white oak road between * courthouse and five forks the brigades extending for some distance up the road at about ten oclock of the morning of the same day general lee came up to the right of the confederate line and held a * with his * during this council a prisoner was brought into camp he was a captain in * cavalry and was captured near five forks upon the examination of this officer he let out the information that the whole federal cavalry more than fifteen thousand strong supported by a heavy infantry force was at or near * courthouse lee did not give much * to the * of the federal captain nor did * who was one of the * mentioned as being in * with him but just about this time a message came from fitz lee * that the enemys cavalry were in great force at five forks and had driven in all of his * upon this information lee at once sent orders to fitz lee to take command of the whole cavalry his own division the division of w h f lee and a part of * division and make an attack upon the cavalry force at five forks at noon on the same day lee ordered pickett to move on to five forks with his small force of artillery and infantry * of his own three brigades * * and * brigades both together not equal to a full brigade and six * pieces of artillery under colonel * and take command of the whole force the main object of the attack was to break the federal left the proposed plan to further that end was that pickett should press down upon * courthouse and as far down upon the front as possible and that r h anderson should at the same time make an attack in front the federal cavalry was in strong force between the right of the confederate line and five forks and picketts men being compelled to drive the federals out of their way the entire distance the * in their front and flank being * they could not of course make much of a record as to speed after eighteen hours of * marching through the * of rain * and * and the * of shot shell and * pickett reached five forks there had already been a sharp skirmish at this point between the two cavalry forces immediately on picketts arrival he threw out two regiments of infantry and the federal cavalry was soon driven in it was picketts intention to * on to * courthouse but after * with fitz lee the other cavalry not as yet having joined him the night being dark and * and his own men tired and worn out it was decided that he should stop in order to keep the federals at a * distance during the night pickett threw out two of his brigades on the courthouse road * and * advanced almost a mile driving the federal cavalry before them though being dismounted and armed with the * * the * made a vigorous fight the strength of the enemy was beyond * on the morning of the #* lee led * * * and * brigades against the federal fifth corps commanded by warren which was posted between picketts command and the confederate * warren was driven back behind * run pickett placed w h f lees and * cavalry on the right followed by the infantry and artillery fitz lees division commanded by thomas t * was at the left w h f lees cavalry * the infantry column on the direct road to a crossing at * creek and * moved by an immediate road in the same direction at the * of * creek w h f lee made one of the most brilliant and severe cavalry * of the war * a crossing immediately in face of a superior force of the federal troops who had all the * of position with a stream of water in front the infantry were unable to cross at this point and sought a passage lower down * brigade leading it suffered serious loss in the passage though it made a brilliant * across the creek and killed and captured about a hundred of the enemy driving their forces back to * courthouse the loss of the confederates was * confined to w h f lees cavalry and * and * brigades many valuable officers were killed although the fifth corps had suffered great loss it * and charged against lees brigades but was again forced back to white oak road and then to the * the darkness of night fell over the confederates within but half a mile of * courthouse had some good southern * been there to stop the sun in its course for even one little * the courthouse would have been ours the federals were being * reinforced with infantry grant in * to * request having ordered up the fifth corps under warren * fifteen thousand the whole of * and * cavalry were in front * division * thousand strong having been sent forward when the battle was over pickett sent a * to lee who was on the lines at petersburg telling him of the success of the day but * that he had just * through his * the * of the heavy infantry support to * cavalry at * courthouse and that he had no * but to withdraw with his small force this he proposed to do under cover of the night further assurance of the truth of this report proved to pickett that his decision was a * one he accordingly left the front of * courthouse at two oclock on the morning of the 1st day of april and started back toward five forks thus ended another scene in the fifth act of the tragedy on which the dark * was so soon to fall for nearly two years after the fatal battle of gettysburg the war had drawn its slow length along with * * and now the end had almost come * gloom had closed around the confederacy and its shadow fell heavily over those who for four years had so * borne the * of * struggle in february 1865 president davis * his military authority and general r e lee became * of the confederate armies all communication with foreign powers was closed and no more hope of assistance remained lees object was to reach the * * of virginia and north carolina and join * forces while grants policy was to prevent the * on the last of march lees army of less than forty thousand was stretched until its extreme right rested on five forks fifteen miles * of petersburg a situation which * lees reflection on the 2d of april when the line had been * by the federal sixth corps and the gallant a p hill lay dead on the field near petersburg it has happened as i told them at richmond it would * the line has been stretched until it has broken during the long struggle of the south for * no more desperate and heroic action occurred than took place at five forks on april i 1865 when federal reinforcements were sent to sheridan at * courthouse the intention of grant was that the fifth corps fifteen thousand strong should attack picketts left and cut off retreat grant was * of the united states army and his power was exceedingly great but he could not control the * the rain fell heavily on the night of the #* and the fifth corps * over the difficult road found no enemy awaiting it at the end of its * journey pickett having notice of the * attack changed his orders for battle and withdrew to five forks which he reached early in the morning of april i followed by * troops the movement was made in perfect order and as * and quietly as possible they brought all their wounded off the field and buried all their dead after a * march over roads and * almost * because of the heavy * five forks was reached where having a few hours the start of sheridan pickett halted to rest but almost immediately upon his arrival he received a message from lee in * to one sent by pickett the * day saying five forks the point which lee ordered pickett to hold at all * is simply a crossing at right * of two country roads and the * of a third road * one of these * it is * in a low * country and has no natural points of defense its only * was a hastily * * the place was absolutely not * of being * except by a very large body of troops and the small force directed to hold it could easily have been turned on the right or left and * from the main army at petersburg it was therefore a most unfortunate * of a field on which to meet a superior force and yet six thousand men infantry cavalry and artillery all told were stationed here to hold the ground against an attack by * thousand troops supported by heavy artillery the task was impossible of * but the effort was nevertheless most bravely made where nature * a small force of men the * may prove * even to an army much superior in numbers she * up * * * stone walls and * * of darkness for the protection of her chosen few on a straight wide plain nature stands aside and views the *

five forks and his * order to hold it at all * that he of course intended to send to him at once a strong * immediately therefore upon the * of lees * order to hold five forks pickett formed his line of battle on the white oak road at right * and across the ford road which * the * railroad and set his men to throwing up breastworks they * a * * * and threw the earth up behind the * * and though they knew the holding of five forks would be * * worked and waited it was nine oclock on saturday morning when the line was formed the number and * of the confederate force was as follows * * and * brigades acting as one and * not * over eight hundred men were on the left stuarts brigade * to about one thousand was next on the right and extended to the forks of the roads then came * brigade one thousand strong and then * eight hundred strong * * on the right of the line the six * pieces of artillery were placed along the line at wide * fitz lees cavalry was ordered into position on the left flank w h f lees on the right flank * * cavalry were all of * division that were present though they did fine service the cavalry * in all about twentyfive hundred men thus cavalry infantry and artillery * to not over six thousand men to meet * cavalry * in itself more than five times that of picketts whole command in addition to * own force he was supported by * infantry corps as soon as the confederates were in position they began * down trees * up * * trenches and * * their work was interrupted only when they were compelled to seize their guns to * an attack three times the labor was thus * the federals having begun the attack upon the front as soon as the line was formed having * the foe they would immediately return to their work which they * by singing my maryland * and * blue flag the hurried work of three hours of these hungry * veterans a * * a few * * covered pine * were their only line of breastworks and yet these devoted men were ready to do or die about two oclock in the afternoon a general advance and attack began along the whole front and on the right flank which was quickly repulsed with considerable loss to the enemy pickett had a short time before * to the north side of * run and hearing the sound of battle he * through a rain of fire and * from * troops on the ford road soon after he reached his command colonel * of the artillery was mortally wounded and fell near where the general was standing * his line * was shot from his horse by a * just after the charge had been repulsed and fell in rear of two of his guns a few minutes after this attack a * fire of * to the left and rear was heard the * of picketts troops that the left wing had been turned and * back and that they would be taken in * proved * true * corps had swept around to the left flank while * cavalry mounted and dismounted was * the front and right warren forced * and * back and * them on stuarts brigade of picketts division * brigade was withdrawn from the front moved * to the left and thrown forward to meet the * column pickett leading cheering on the men waving the confederate * he dashed up to colonel * whose regiment was on the left * him of the situation of affairs he said i * upon your regiment to save the day you will have to * with twice your number but i know i can * upon you colonel * was a * gallant determined soldier and a * * fellow i shall follow the moon marse george meaning he should go * and well save the day if our last man has to * his * dust you boys are all too gallant and * to * the dust of their mammy you know marse george the general smiled and rode on he crossed the road to higher ground within forty * of where the enemys columns were * whence came * of * falling around him but his life seemed a * one the men were * at every * and the order to retreat was repeated three times but his boys refused to move till their general should come and then they retreated at * and in good order follow the moon called out colonel * death or prison was their choice many * the former pickett * * stuart and * were across the road calling on the men to get into line to meet the next * a part of the famous * * with * leading were

had taken from the hand of a fallen * and his deep voice joined with * in the * there were very few to * around that * * crimson with the * blood of the south sacred to a cause for which many a brave man had died and many another had offered his life willing to fall rather than see that * suffer * very few they were * with the host * against them but their voices rang out * and the notes of their * * and * from the forest at this time the confederates were just four hundred yards in rear of five forks and though the federals had captured many prisoners * from * * and stuarts brigades they had gained but little ground * men stood with their horses ready to return to their guns as soon as the opportunity should present the federals charged upon the front and right straight through the open field to the woods in which the confederate line was formed a heavy force was thrown around the right and left the federal cavalry poured down on the right and rear picketts men were * held as in a * by the cavalry with a line of infantry in the rear a deadly fire from all sides they formed in front north and south and met with desperate * this double * cut to pieces defeated captured all that were left of them still pressed on in * determination the * fighting of the war was done here so near together were the * that they * each other with their * again and again the heroic little band * round the flag fighting on this ground unknown to them until darkness fell so heavily that they knew not friend from foe never were troops more hardly pressed never did troops fight more * surrounded by a force which * them more than five to one with no * no * * * they simply yielded to * numbers and could have been captured by warren and sheridan any * two oclock in the afternoon they would probably all have been destroyed on the retreat but for the brave stand of * brigade and the * of w h f lees cavalry who held the federal * until the * was reached as the general rode off the field he saw a band of soldiers who had paused and seemed to be drawing toward themselves the fire of the enemy he did not know why they did this he learned later that the devoted little group were offering their lives to save him there were but few to leave the field the many stayed behind lying in * * on that ground which they had so * * night * covered them with her dark * and her tears fell softly on their still white faces the stars crept out one by one in the deep wide * of sky and kept solemn * over the dead general longstreet says in * to this request general pickett sent the following statement picketts command * * in the * * to their defeat at five forks * * in the justice of their cause ever * * * they held themselves in * to follow their beloved and * commander with * courage * he should lead them during the evening of the 1st of april the command collected and assembled on the railroad * around their headquarters flag * and weary * by * * sadly reduced in numbers by losses in killed and captured * not only by past * but by the * of future defeat they gathered bravely around their leader and their flag with a courage which might lead them to death but would forever preserve them from * early sunday morning the 2d of april following the battle of five forks pickett after * his men * them for their confidence in him and for their * services in the last * through which they had just passed with words of courage he gave the order to march * with them toward * * at which point it was his intention to cross the appomattox river and * the main army while the command however was at a * at * * pickett received through a * an order from r h anderson to report to him at * tavern most of * * brigade had already gone across the river at * * on the following morning just as the day was breaking pickett in * with the orders received from anderson started out with his command but he had not gone very far on his way when he found the road * and * with * from * and * divisions these * informed pickett that the lines in front of petersburg had been forced that they had been cut off from petersburg and that anderson had gone on toward * courthouse assured of the truth of this information pickett immediately followed on up the river and on the evening of the same day the 2d of april joined anderson at deep creek nearly * for no rations had been issued since the * supply of the 29th and yet not a * was heard a few hours afterward * brigade * about nine hundred reported this brigade had also been severely engaged meeting with serious loss on their march they learned that their beloved a p hill had been killed at petersburg and just as they were going into * came too the first sad intelligence of the * of richmond and its * destruction by fire these mournful * struck a * of despair to every heart but especially to those whose families and homes together with all their * * were within the captured burning city with the light which we now have it seems strange that this blow should have been made * by coming as a surprise but the fact was that the loss of their capital was a * for which the confederate soldiers were * * it seemed however but to * their * as they * marched on to describe the * of the march on to * courthouse and thence to * creek would be to * a picture of the * horror the army supplies were utterly exhausted there was no food to be had in the country all the homes along the line had been * by those who had come in advance there was nothing to eat but a little * corn when they stopped long enough to * it this they * from the ear as they marched along many of the men * by * and suffering loss of sleep and * * by the way and others found themselves going to sleep as they walked along and would * and fall in the road now and then they made a * for a skirmish with the enemy who were on all sides front rear and both * time and again during the * hours they were forced to * and not only draw up in line of battle but form a * square to prevent capture the * of the march were * by the fact that it led through a country in which lived the families and friends of many of these soldiers who were marching on to death * or to the * of defeat yet notwithstanding the fact that they were within a few hours of their homes and loved ones whom they had not seen many of them for months and many for years there was but little * although it was not safe to * far from the command on account of the enemys cavalry yet now and then some one of these * * * by the * of * would venture off in a vain search for food only to fall from * by the * all the * * and * of the four * years put together would not equal those * on this march to * courthouse yet they went bravely on * by the hope that food awaited them there lee knowing that they had started off with only a days rations had ordered provisions to that point in the * the * * by the * lee had taken place the last blow had fallen upon the * confederacy the dread message which had flashed across the * on the morning of sunday the 2d of april had interrupted the * of the government * in st * church in richmond to tell them that their capital had fallen they hastened from the church to the * to secure the confederate * and * them to a place f safety then giving orders for the firing of the city they left on the evening train lighted on their way by the flames which * the capital and followed by the * reports of the * * on the james next morning the * army came * across country * in a wild race to see which could be first in at the death for richmond had fallen at the very time that the ragged hungry weary suffering soldiers of a lost cause were marching on their painful journey cheering themselves with the hope of * at the next * the flag of the * was waving over the capital city of the confederacy upon * at * on the afternoon of the #* the army * that the supplies ordered by lee had been brought to the point * but the authorities had immediately sent the train containing them to richmond to bring away the * of the fallen capital and by some strange * it had gone on without waiting to * thus was the great army of brave patient suffering men who had offered for their cause life home and all the hopes and * they had ever known * for a few * officers and the * of a nation which had died in its * the confederate forces were now * scattered lee recognized the necessity of * on leaving richmond his intention was to retreat to * on the southern * of virginia * of richmond from which point he hoped to effect a * union with johnston his first * point was * * miles south of richmond at the junction of the richmond and * and the norfolk and western * this place safely reached he could destroy the roads in the rear and for a time escape pursuit he had gained some hours and might have carried his plan to success but for the delay caused by the fatal mistake in * off the * train of supplies which he had taken such * to provide the * of the * army and the * * which were made in efforts to obtain * enabled sheridan to * lee and reach * on the * railroad seven miles * of * from which place he * grant at petersburg grant arrived at * at midnight presented himself at the headquarters of sheridan who * from his * hastened to meet him sheridan explained the position by means of a * hastily drawn upon a letter which he took from his pocket lee is caught said grant it will be hard for him to get away perhaps it was hard but when sheridan arrived at * on the morning of the #* of april he found that the difficult * had been accomplished and lee had once more * a * * on the morning of the #* pickett reached * creek where for some hours he made a * in line of battle this creek is a * stream difficult to cross running * into the appomattox in the * every effort was being made by the confederates to * on their * and artillery across the appomattox river at * a small town west of the * railroad the mud and * and * * made the progress slow soldiers may live for a time on hope and patriotism but * and horses must have * and corn both the * to lynchburg and the * railroad cross the appomattox at * and the latter again five miles east of it at high bridge the river being too deep to ford * therefore became an important point to both armies ewells command was on picketts left and * division was on his right sheridan with his thousands of * * cavalry was in front making every * to delay the confederates from * until he should be reinforced by his infantry * * received orders to move on thus leaving a gap in the confederate line which grew * as * advanced * from his position on the right of picketts division observed this movement and gave notice of it to pickett who at once made a report to anderson of * * and of the * danger to his own command and asked permission to follow * the order however which anderson had received from the commanderinchief to hold on in connection with ewells command unfortunately prevented him he said from * with picketts request in the meanwhile the gap between pickett and * was * colonel * * of artillery attempted to cross this gap when * was a mile or more in advance of pickett this movement was defeated by sheridan who made a * and vigorous attack upon * pickett * this * immediately pushed with his division across * creek and charged upon the federals with two of his brigades and the other two quickly followed sheridan taken by surprise was driven back more than half a mile * two of * captured guns in his haste he carried off colonel * with him but captain * colonel * * made his escape on one of the * carrying a gun with him pickett then formed line of battle and held it against the repeated * of * dismounted cavalry his division was by this time completely * both * being * about three oclock * after * was * from the federal lines picketts men knew it meant that the infantry so * looked for by sheridan had come to his aid and they realized the increased * of their position the federal cavalry and infantry began at once to close around the confederate right anderson seeing that picketts men were being * in on all sides and knowing that it was too late then for him to move on his line of march gave the order to pickett to draw off his brigades to the rear and to cut his way out in any manner possible anderson in order that he might assist pickett in this movement * * brigade in the rear of picketts line of battle sheridan at once charged on every side picketts men * by numbers fighting * * * to the bitter end their * fate many of the men broke their guns and many of the officers * their * in two rather than surrender them to the enemy they fought as * and * on this their last battlefield when all hope was gone as they had ever done in any battle even when in their first * of glory and in perfect faith of * success * and * were taken prisoners with almost the entire * of their commands * and * succeeded in getting off the field pickett himself with colonel * harrison and his * * dr m m * escaped death or capture almost by a * pickett seeing several * of cavalry riding directly down upon them * around him a mere * of his beloved old division and with this last * the men fired their parting shot into the faces of the advancing * and in the * check they made their escape in the * of * there is found no page which * more * with the light of * than does that which records the retreat of the confederate army after the battle of * creek * * by forced * and * * in battle it yet found strength to turn and with its * * and * effort force back twice across the stream the strong * * army of sheridan friend and foe alike have * over such * * * in the face of so great suffering and disaster truly the last * of the * flames of southern hopes and southern * have shed * glory over the record of the men who kept those flames alive through over four years of heroic struggle against * * of men and resources after the battle of * creek occurred the first * of the blue and gray it was when * soldiers shared their rations with picketts men until grant issued orders for their supply thus the voice of a common * of blood and * was heard as an * to the roar of cannon in after years came other * * lincoln stood at the foot of cemetery ridge and looked * to where the * cannon had so short a time before sent its * death to the valley below some one said to him think of the men who held these heights yes he replied but think of the men who * these heights as picketts division weary * and * * their * way through pennsylvania on the march which ended on the field of gettysburg they passed a small * house * away in the * of a pleasant village as they came near a little maid rushed out upon the * waving the stars and * in a wild burst of * enthusiasm for a moment the leader of that * band felt * that not all its members could be * upon to maintain their * in the presence of that * which to them represented so much of wrong done upon their native soil many of them had come from the war * * of * and * will know what that flag meant to them instantly the general * from the line and taking off his cap bowed to the little maid with all that grace for which he was noted in camp as well as drawingroom and * * the flag of his * then turning he lifted his hand and when the long line had passed every man in it had * his cap to the youthful * and had * the * which she had made her * of battle the delighted little * who had never before received the * of a whole division cried out in a glow of gratitude i wish i had a confederate flag i would wave that too the general was asked afterward how he could bring himself to * the enemys flag i did not * the enemys flag he replied i * the heroic * in the heart of that brave little girl and the glorious old * under which i won my first * on the * * of the greatest battle of the western * the men who held those heights and the men who * those heights all that were left of them met on the old * field where the * deeds known to history had been performed peace had laid her soft * over the heights which nearly a quarter of a century before had been * upon by * * * in * silence the * looked * through the golden sun an * glory lay over the * of little round top and the stream at its base which had once * crimson now * in * * the light above it the clouds of battle had * away long ago and in their place were only soft gray * * * like a veil of peace around the crest where once the philadelphia brigade met the * of picketts men the * had * but many of the brave * of the height yet remained as generous in peace as they had been brave in war they had come with * hands to welcome all who were left of the ragged veterans who so * * cemetery heights on that terrible july day which had burned its fiery mark upon the pages of our history every part of that ground had been * by a * of * the * of the south * itself in * around its broken * long ago but the field on which its * fought and fell is sacred to all southern hearts here upon this spot fell a young lieutenant wounded * death carrying the * of the south when the * from the hospital went over the field to * their sad duty they found him lying under a tree with a worn * for a pillow his youthful face was white with pain and * such a very young face it was one could not help thinking that the arm of a loving mother would be a far more * pillow than the rough old army * for the * head the farewell * of home seemed yet to * upon the gentle lips he was sadly wounded but refused to be taken to the hospital * as a reason for the * of the * aid that he was comfortable and others worse hurt than he should be * for first so they left him because he urged them to do so and when they came later the brave soul had passed beyond the darkness and the pain when he was lifted they saw why he had sent them away he had been lying upon his * carefully folded and placed beneath him that it might not fall into the hands of the enemy the * which he had * in life he guarded still in death tenderly northern hands wrapped it around the dead hero whose * had * its folds and it was his * * and * never was * more * * for his last long sleep never did the * of earth lie in * state than did this boy soldier in the * folds of the flag he had so loved stranger hands laid in a northern grave that noble son of the south unknown the grave is marked unknown to the * but known forever to his god stranger eyes let fall the tears which sank into the earth to unite with * * forces and spring * in loves life and beauty to * in violets above that hero heart who shall say that the winds * * did not * upon their radiant wings a breath of those sweet flowers and carry it like a holy * to waiting * hearts in his beloved * a young officer rushed up in front of * battery * his sword and crying take that battery colonel * * fire the artillery * out its fiery death and all within its range fell after the battle was over colonel * picked up the officers sword which had been so * * in front of his battery and carried it with him in honor of the brave soldier who had borne it to his death for years he made efforts to find some one who might claim it by right of * with its brave * * in this he brought it with him to the * on the * ground from which he had taken it and in an * speech presented it to picketts men amid tears for the noble dead and cheers for the noble living it is still * as a * * of * and the * with which it is * by the * of its * and the * of its * will never * over there is where * with his brave north * fought with desperate courage to support the left flank of picketts column as the artillery * * through its ranks hopeless effort but not vain for the * with which it was made is a * of glory on the brow of the good north state here the plain honest man of the people stood and gave * to his thought in words which appeal not to those alone to whom he spoke they sprang from a deep * soul and struck * * in all hearts whose * and dearest had helped to make that ground so sacred that no living presence could * its * here * reached a height of courage and * love from which it could not * and had gone beyond into the highest the last full measure of devotion had been given by the gray and the blue alike the brave men living and dead the living come with generous hand of * north and south and their voices speak only friendship the dead i look beyond and see their loved and loving faces on the crest of * * height they fell to rise again in * triumph from the eternal silence they look down and are glad over the long * on which * garnett and thousands of other brave ones marched to death the * were * in a great white sea as i looked they seemed to fall crushed under the rush of * feet and through the * of a quarter century i saw that long line moving forward in the * charge of which the poet has written this * * of the greatest battle of the war was not the first * within my experience of the blue and the gray when the great civil war closed it left me as it did other southern women with a bitterness of heart which could * of nothing good in those whom i regarded as enemies the general had his old army friends with whom he had fought side by side on the fields of mexico whom he had loved through all the terrible four years and whose affection for him had never * the sword had * the few * which had * me with the north the same bitterness went with me on our return from * when we so * became the guests in new york of some of the generals dearest and most * comrades in arms in the * days as i became * with these true and generous friends i learned that men may * * * and even draw their * against each other and still keep warm and faithful hearts that only * the opportunity to give expression to their * feeling i remembered that my hero had fought as bravely under the stars and * as he had ever fought under the stars and bars while my beloved south held the highest place in my * * next to her was the north that could * brave and noble men whose friendship could stand a * so severe i took the generals watch which he had carried through two * and had * on the * side of the case the names of the battles in which he had fought under each flag on the outside i had * the two * joined together with two * one of blue the other of gray i had not * the general about this * and the pleasure which mingled with his surprise showed how dear to him were the memories of his * * and the love of his old time friends a solemn * took place when we collected the bodies of the confederate and federal soldiers and gave them * in the ground which had been made sacred by their blood * the dust of the blue and the gray mingled in the same coffin out from the * their hands united reach down to us and point the way to a higher and * national life years later there was a sad * when the philadelphia brigade came to richmond to attend the * of picketts * on gettysburg hill in * cemetery the first time that such a * of * had ever been offered to a fallen foe brave men come to do honor to a hero who had fought against them their presence was a touching * which * to the * of the southern heart and the * formed then can never be broken in the year in which i write the philadelphia brigade and picketts men met again in the beautiful * city whose generous heart had * a * of exquisite * for the * of her guests it was a happy * * only by the absence of loved ones who once met with us in * * we still seemed to hear their voices * memories of the * days when not even the most * soul could have * the time when the hand of the gray would * the hand of the blue in a friendship that was * in blood a few weeks afterward there was a * * when the members of * post grand army of the * of * * island * the daughter of the confederacy when she started on her last solemn journey to the south which she so loved sweet * davis her noble and * life too early ended upon earth * the long long sleep in the heart of that land which held her so dear and on her sacred grave north and south alike gently place the * of love and now * at * our president in whose administration north and south have come nearer perhaps than at any other time since the beginning of our
