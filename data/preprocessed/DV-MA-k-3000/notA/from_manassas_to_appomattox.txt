general lee would have had time to ********** and ******* his trenches while hooker was *********** at chancellorsville he could have held his army ***** behind his lines where his men would have done

******** lines for defence while his adversary was divided by two ********* of the river which made lees sixty thousand for defence about equal to the one hundred and thirteen thousand under general

he had been *********** recently by the war department to the division upon application of general hood and in consequence there was some feeling of ******* between him and brigadiergeneral law the

a day or two after this interview the president called the commanders to meet him again at general ****** headquarters he expressed desire to have the army ****** away from the lines around

east of the city and of the mountain the road was west of the mountain from six to twenty miles from the command we were in support of his batteries to be ready for action at the moment his artillery practice called for it we held nearly as much of his line as the other eight divisions none of the commanders had authority to move a man from the lines until the #** of october when he gave orders

general bragg denied all reports sent him of the enemy from my signal party treated them with ******** then reported that the road was under my command his report is remarkable in that he failed to

instead of the valley it could have been occupied with as little loss as he afterwards had and less danger he had marched by our line of cavalry without their knowing and general bragg had but a
