before six months ******* all the ********* would be ******* out of her soul by the ******** of the public and the ********* of the children now i dont confess to be an angel but i do claim a

its coffin could be ****** enough to ******** poor little ********** ***** i dont deny that sometimes i am compelled to ****** them for it is as much my duty to **** them for bad conduct as to see that their ***** are ******** ****** and their clothes kept in order am i to let them grow up ******* and ***** must i stand by and see them **** out each others hair and **** off one ******** ears of course not mrs ******* you must preserve some ********** must i well miss i will show you how *********** that sounds and how ****** it works there is your brother stanley i mean no ******* miss but special cases explain better than ****************** your brother stanley who ran ******* what because he was ******** and wanted to see me no such thing ******* your pardon perhaps he told you that but remember there are always two sides to every **** the truth of the matter is just this stanley has an **** habit of ******* which i will not ******** and twice when i heard him ******** at the other children i ****** him well and ******* him ******* last week i told him and joe ***** to shell a basket of **** while the **** was making some *********** for them and before i was out of the

that stanley was ******* again your brother ******** a ******* that was lying on the ******* and ***** he would kill him if he did he ***** a blow at **** head but slipped on the ******** and the ******* struck the boys right foot ******* off one of his **** now what would you have done under the ******************** the children to be ********** in that style you say i must have ********** well miss i tried to ********** ******** ********** out of him by giving him a ******** and the end of the matter was that he ran away that afternoon that is not the worst of ***** the children all know the facts and since they find that stanley **** can run away and be ********* in his ************ of course it ***** to ********** them so i say that if i do my duty i am ****** by the ******* of people who know nothing of the circumstances and if i fail to ******* my duty i am ****** by my own ************* between the two i have a ********* time for i ******* to you miss that ******** ********* was a small affair in comparison with what i pass through every week i love the children and try to be kind to them but i cant have them ******* and ******** like ******* and ******** each

************ but miss in the name of common sense how can i get along unless the friends of the children ******* me did you ****** stanley and send him back on the contrary you ************ his bad conduct and kept him with you and it is perfectly natural that little ****** here should be ************ and anxious to join him i cant ***** her for i know she ****** her brother who was always very tender and *********** in his ********* of her i appreciate the difficulties which ******** you and believe that you are *************** ******** to do your duty towards these children but i knew that if i compelled stanley to return it would ******* instead of ********** the ******** at this ******** the ****** was ******** from the room and during the silence that ensued ****** ******* into her

declined the proposition saying she would only trouble the latter to teach her ******* do you know why she is so anxious to ******* that language no to tell you the truth i know less and less every

determined not to ******* if you knew her as well as i do you would appreciate the *********** of trying to ******** her to do anything but you men never see what lies right under your ***** and i believe if you lived in the same house with that child for five years longer you would understand her as little as you do today ulpian shut the door and sit down here close to me dr grey ******** and ****** her ******** hand on her brothers knee miss jane said ************ my dear boy i dont know whether i ought to tell you and indeed i do not see my way clearly but you seem so ************ that i

muriel so ********* no i cannot even ********** muriel is very ******* and affectionate and seems disposed to become very fond of salome if she would only ********* her ******** can you explain the ******* if you were not as blind as a **** or the **** in ******* **** you would see that salome is ******** ******* of your affection for your ward and that is the cause of all the trouble it is ************ and ****** in her to ********* such feelings and ******** she has no right to ******* any ******** towards my ward ************ yes quite true but did you ever know a woman to be very ********** concerning the man she loves dr ***** quiet face flushed and he rose instantly looking *********** and *********** surely my dear sister you do not intend to ********* or desire me to ***** that salome has any he paused bit his lip and walked to the window i mean to say in plain ********** and i desire you to understand that salome is no longer a child and that she loves you my dear boy better than she will ever love any other human being these things are very strange indeed and girls ***** ****** all ***** and ********** all ********** ************ but nevertheless it does no good to shut your eyes to facts that are as clear as daylight it is not a sudden ***** that has seized the poor child it has grown upon her almost without her ************* herself but i discovered it the day that you left home so ************ for new york her distress ******** her real feelings and since then i have watched her and can see how completely her thoughts centre in you oh ***** i hope you

ask you yes i think i can safely promise that much simply because i wish to ******* nothing from you and i cannot ********** any ******* on your part from which i should ****** what would you ask is it because you are interested in some other woman that you speak so ********** of the ************ of my poor ******* case no my sister no woman has any claim or hold on my heart stronger than that of

************ of earlier years that ******* ********* her character and i can truly say that i am interested in her ******* and *********** and have a faint ********* affection for her but i thoroughly ********** my own feelings when i assure you ***** that were salome and i left alone in the world i could never for a moment ********* the idea of calling such a ******* child my wife are you

******** what ********* ************* could i promise myself what confidence could i ********** ****** could i ************ a ***** girl who without ******* and utterly ******** ******* her love if

******* and looked ******* at the child once for all let me tell you that there is no more possibility of my loving muriel or ***** than salome of the three i care most for muriel who looks upon me as

********** true doctor yet sometimes instead of ********** her it is best to ***** her as a ****** child i believe you could obtain some influence over her if you would only try to break the *** because she has spoken kindly of you several times since i have been so helpless and asked what she could do to show her gratitude for your ******** to me yesterday she said she intended to direct robert to take some fine ***** to your house and she remarked that your eyes were in comparison with other ***** what ******* is to working ************ so full of rest that tired anxious people might be ********* by looking at them sir that is more than i have heard her utter for seven years about ******* and therefore i think you might do her some good dr grey shook his head but remained silent and presently elsie touched his arm and continued there is something i wish to say to you before i die but not now i want you to promise me that when you see my end is indeed at hand you will tell me in time to let me talk a little to you will you you may ****** for months and it is possible that you may die quite suddenly consequently it might be ************* for me to ****** the promise you
