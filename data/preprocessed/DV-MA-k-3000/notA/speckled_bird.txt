i ask how you obtained your information i was in his ******* next to the library when you and father came in the door was open and through the thin ******* i heard every ********* cruel horrible word

perhaps in time i may learn you considered yourself the price of the papers and felt assured i could not refuse to **** any man who held them could own you body and soul any ********** **** any
