here i am at your service madame ******** waiting for any suggestion it may please you to put in my weary brain as a means to pass this **** ****** sunday afternoon for the great **** ***** over the way has this instant struck only ******** three and if a rain is added to the high wind that has been ******* ever since the month commenced and ******** my going to mrs ******* before dark i fear i shall fall a victim to the ***** for the first time in my life indeed it is **** miriam went to ******** with ***** yesterday and i miss them beyond all expression miriam is so ***** she says she cannot live without me and yet she can go away and stay for months without ******* me in the ********* degree ********* ***** and i well it is ****** to fancy myself alive without miriam she would rather not visit with me and yet be it for an hour or a month i never ******* enjoy myself without her away from home miriam is my rock ahead in life ill ******* on her yet its a grand sight for people out of reach who will not come in ******* with the ******** but it is quite another thing to me *********** ******* on those sharp points in my little *********** that ***** so ********* a ******** to the grand scene around i am sure to ******* i hold that every family has at heart one genius in some line no matter what except in our family where each is a genius in his own way *** and miriam has a genius for the piano now i never could bear to ******* with any one knowing that it is the law of my being to be ******** to others consequently to fail and failure is so *********** to me so it is that people may force me to ******* any pursuit by ********* with me for knowing that failure is ********** rather than fight against ******* i give up de ***** **** ********** i was said to have a ****** for the piano as well as miriam sister and miss ******** said i would make a better ******** than she having more patience and ************ however i took hardly six months ******* to her ever so many years heard how well she played got ********* with myself and gave up the piano at ******** with ********* **** of playing every year or so at ******* ***** gave me a ****** here was a new field where i would have no *********** i knew no one who played on it so i set to work and taught myself to ****** it mother only ******** me how to **** it but miriam took a fancy to it and i taught her all i knew but as she gained i lost my ****** and if she had not soon abandoned it i would know nothing of it now she does not know half that i do about it they tell me i play much better than she yet they let her play on it in company before me and i cannot ******* to play after why is it it is not ****** or i would play ********* of ********* her it is not ******** for i love to see her show her ******* it is not *********** i love her too much to be ******* to her what is it then simply **** of ********** i would say if there was no ************ near to correct me and point out that ************* **** at the extreme southern and ********** portion of my ****** head ********** or not mr ************ the result is that miriam is by far the best ********* in baton rouge and i would rank ********** even in the ********** village of jackson and yet i must have some ear for music to know as many songs as ***** is a family ******* not very difficult songs or very beautiful ones to be sure besides being very ************* **** but the ***** will run in my head and it must take some ear to catch them people say to me of course you play to which i ********** ******* oh no but miriam ***** *********** you sing i believe not at all except for father that is what i used to say and the children but miriam ***** you are fond of ******* very but i cannot dance as well as miriam of course you are fond of society no indeed miriam is and she goes to all the parties and ******* all the visits for me the consequence is that if the person who questions is a stranger he goes off satisfied that that miriam must be a great girl but that little sister of hers well a **** to say the least so it is miriam ******* all my **** and so it is too that it is not ******* and ** off until that dreary 1861 i had no idea of sorrow or grief how i love to think of myself at that time not as myself but as some happy ******** child who ****** through life loving gods whole world too much to love any particular one outside of her own family she was more childish then yet i like her for all her ***** i can say it now for she is as dead as though she was lying *********** now do not imagine that ***** has become an **** lady in the fifteen months that have ******* since for it is no such thing her heart does **** occasionally but that is a secret between her and this little ******** furnished room and when she **** over it there is no one more fond of making ************ of the children or of ******** ******* or mother by the foot and making them play **** ******* now all this done by a young lady who ********* eighteen months ago with so much regret that she has lost so much of her high spirits might ***** that her spirits were before tremendous and yet they were not that other ***** was ******** i am sure in her ******* moments but there is something hurried and ********** in this ones ****** that ******* me of some one who is making a ***** of being ***** under ********** circumstances no that is not a nice ***** now to my taste the ************ of ## promised much pleasure for the rest of the year and though secession was talked about i do not believe any one anticipated the war that has been ********** our country ever since with no ******** of *********** for some time to come true the garrison was taken but then several pleasant officers of the louisiana army were stationed there and made quite an agreeable addition to our small parties and we did not think for a moment that trouble would grow out of it at least we girls did not next louisiana ******* but still we did not trouble ourselves with gloomy ************* for many strangers visited the town and our parties ***** and ***** grew ***** and more ******** one little party shall i ever forget it was on the 9th of march i think such an *** ***** little party such ***** things happened what a **** mr *** made of himself even more so than usual but hush its not fair to laugh at a lady under peculiar circumstances and he tried so hard to make himself agreeable poor fellow that i ought to like him for being so ******** to my commands say something new something ***** i said tired of a subject on which he had been *********** all the evening for i had taken a long ride with him before sunset he had ******** me to mrs ******* and here he was still at my side and his conversation did not interest me to hear with him was to obey something ***** well here he commenced telling something about somebody the fun of which seemed to ******* in the ********* having ******* his ***** against something else i only listened to the latter part i was ***** and showed it ***** was i to laugh at such a story day before yesterday just about this time of evening as i came home from the ********* ***** ************ came in ever since the 12th of february he has been waiting on the yankees pleasure in the mississippi at all places below ******** and having been under fire for thirteen days at *********** island no ## having surrendered monday night and ********* ******* thinking it high time to take possession of the ******** *** at new orleans and give them a small party

that ******* me of ***** and tells me that like *** he will die young and these days that are going by ****** me of *** too i am walking in our ********* of last year the ****** was the day we gave him a party on his return home i see him so distinctly standing near the **** table talking to mr ****** whom he had met only that morning and who three weeks after had ****** blood upon his hands he is a ******** now without *** or object in life as before with only one desire to die and death still ***** from him and he ***** not *** himself of life all those ******* there that night have ********* trial and ********** since father is dead and ***** mr ********* lies at ******* with his ***** ********* by a ****** every young man there has been in at least one battle since and every

***** stayed with us and we all ***** him so much and he thought so much of us and last week a week ago today he was killed on the battlefield of ****** among the many who visited us in the beginning of 1861 there was mr ******** i took a ******* to him the first time i ever saw him and being accustomed to say just what i pleased to all the other gentlemen tried it with him it was at dinner and for a long while i had the advantage and though father would sometimes look grave gibbes and all at my end of the table would ****** with laughter at last mr ******** commenced to ********* and my ******* changed into respect for a man who could make an excellent ******** with perfect ************ and after dinner when the others took their leave and he asked permission to remain during his

***** little mr ** my little golden **** what a dont call names i *** him a ****** for cold hands and the other day when i heard of his being wounded at ****** i could not help laughing a little at tom *** being hurt what was the use of throwing a nice big cannon ball that might have ******* a man down away on that poor little fellow when a *** from a ****** would have made the same impression not but what he is brave but little **** is so soft then there was that *********** mr ** who ********** one subject never ceased speaking until he had touched on all one evening he came in talking and never paused even for a reply until he bowed himself out talking still when mr ******** who had been forced to silence as well as the rest threw himself back with a sigh of relief and exclaimed this man ***** like a woman i thought it the best description of mr *** conversation i had ever heard it was all on the ******* no *********** to anything except to put the greatest possible number of words of no meaning in one sentence while speaking of the most ******* thing night or day mr ** never passed home without crying out to me *** ***** **** ***** and if the parlor were ******** lighted so that all from the street might see us and be ********* to us themselves i always ****** my head to the ***** darkness and laughed no matter who was present though it sometimes ******* remark you see i knew the **** coming from a party ******** by mr ** miriam by mr ** we had to wait a long time before rose opened the door which ******** i employed in ******* up and down the gallery followed by my ******** singing which **** remark mr ** not speaking french lost entirely and mr ** ******** it with his *********** and belief in it and ever afterwards called me *** ***** **** ***** another date in **** short history i see myself walking home with mr *** just after ******* meeting miriam and dr woods at the gate only that was a ****** instead of a saturday as this from the other side mr ****** comes up and ***** us we stand talking in the bright moonlight which makes miriam look white and ********** i am holding roses in my hand in return for which one little ***** has been begged from my garden and is now ******** as a ********* i turn to speak to that man of whom i said to dr woods before i even knew his name who is this man who passes here so constantly i feel that i shall hate him to my dying day he told me his name was ****** a good ******** fellow etc and afterwards when i did know him dr woods would ask every time we met well do you hate ****** yet i could not really hate any one in my heart so i always answered he is a *********** **** but i will hate him yet but even now i cannot my only feeling is intense pity for the man who has ***** us so severe a blow who made my dear father bow his gray head and shed such bitter tears the moon is rising still higher now and people are ******** to the grand meeting where the state of the country is to be ********* and the three young men bow and ***** off too later at eleven oclock miriam and i are up at ****** waiting until the boat comes with miss ******** who is going away as usual i am ******* and ******* by ***** ***** suddenly stands in the parlor door looking very grave and very quiet he is holding fathers ***** in his hand and says he has come to take us over home i was laughing still so i said wait while i prepared for some last piece of ***** but he smiled for the first time and throwing his arm around me said come home you ***** and laughing still i followed him he left us in the hall saying he must go to ******** a moment but to leave the door open for him so we went up and i ran in his room and lighted his *** for him as i did every night when we went up together in a little while i heard him come in and go to his room i knew nothing then but next day going into mothers room i saw him standing before the glass door of her ****** looking at a black coat he had on ************* i cried out oh dont *** dont what is ** it a nice coat he asked yes but it is ******** up to the throat and i dont like to see it it looks here i went out as ******** as i came in that black coat so ******* ******** troubled me he came to our room after a while and said he was going ten miles out in the country for a few days i begged him to stay and ********** him for going away so soon after he had come home but he said he must ****** perhaps i am tired of you and want to see something new ill be so glad to get back in a few days father said yes he must go so he went without any further explanation walking out to mr ********* that evening ***** and i sat down on a fallen **** beyond the ******** ********* and there she told me what had happened the night before sitting on dr ****** gallery with six or eight others who had been singing *** called on mr ********* to sing he ******** by singing one that was not nice old mr ****** got up to leave and *** said i hope we are not ********** you no he said he was tired and would go home as soon as he was gone his son who i have since heard was under the influence of ***** though *** always ********** that he was not said it was a shame to ******* his poor old father *** answered you heard what he said we did not ******* him you are a **** the other cried that is a name that none of our family has either ******* or borne with and quick as thought *** sprang to his feet and struck him across the face with the ************ he held the blow sent the lower part across the ******* in the street as the spring was ******** by it while the upper part to which was fastened the sword for it was fathers ********* remained in his hand i doubt that he ever before knew the **** could come apart certainly he did not ******** it until the other ****** ********* he was taking advantage over an ******* man when ******* him he ***** threw it after the body of the **** and said now we are equal the others answer was to draw a ***** and was about to ****** it into ***** who ********* to ****** when mr ********* threw himself on mr ****** and dragged him off it was a little while after that ***** came for us the consequence of this was a ********* from mr ****** in the morning which was accepted by ****** friends who appointed monday at ********* to meet ***** did not tell me that she said she thought it had been settled ********* so i was not ****** and only wanted ***** to come back from **** ****** soon the possibility of his fighting never occurred to me sunday evening i was on the front steps with miriam and dr woods talking of ***** and ******* he would come you want ***** the doctor repeated after me you had better learn to live without him what an ********* i said and wondered when he would come still later miriam father and i were in the parlor when there was a *** on the window just above his head and i saw a hand for an instant father hurried out and we heard several voices and then steps going away mother came down and asked who had been there but we only knew that ******* it was father had afterward gone with them mother went on there is something going on which is to be kept from me every one seems to know it and to make a secret of it i said nothing for i had promised ***** not to tell and even i did not know all when father came back ***** was with him i saw by his *** and how are you girls how he wished us to take it so neither moved from our ****** while he sat down on the sofa and asked what kind of a ****** we had had and we talked of anything except what we were thinking of until we went upstairs *** afterwards told me that he had been arrested up there and father went with him to give **** and that the ******* had gone out to ********* after mr ****** he told me all about it next morning saying he was glad it was all over but sorry for mr ****** for he had a blow on his face which nothing would **** out i said *** if you had fought much as i love you i would rather he had killed you than that you should have killed him i love you too much to be willing to see blood on your hands first he laughed at me then said if i had killed him i never would have seen you again we thought it was all over so did he but baton rouge was wild about it mr ****** was the ***** of the town having nothing else to do and whenever he got ***** or ***** would ***** down ******* he ***** that same night before ***** met him he had ******* one man and had dragged another over the room by the hair but these ****** went home and waited for a ********* ******* so the mothers sisters and ******** friends of those who had ********* borne the ***** and being ******* ******* the example of their ****** and asked why dr ****** had not ***** as they had done and waited for an ******* then there was another ******* who cried only blood could **** out that blow and make a gentleman of mr ****** again as though he ever had been one so ***** assembled at street ******* and ********* it until father said to us that monday night these people are so excited and are trying so hard to make this affair worse that i would not be surprised if they shot each other down in the street speaking of ***** and the other *** seemed to think of it no more though and ********* said he must go to the city and ******* brother as to where he should *********** ********* himself i was sorry yet glad that he would then get away from all this trouble i dont know that i ever saw him in higher spirits than he was that day and evening the ##** lilly and ******* were here until late and he laughed and talked so *********** that we called him ***** we might have ******* by his *********** spirits that he was trying to ******* something from us he went away before ******** and i never saw him again there is no word in the english language that can express the state in which we are and have been these last three days day before yesterday news came early in the morning of three of the enemys ***** passing the forts and then the excitement began it increased rapidly on hearing of the ******* of eight of our gunboats in the engagement the capture of the forts and last night of the burning of the ******* and cotton in the city while the yankees were taking possession today the excitement has reached the point of ******** i believe i am one of the most ************* in my small circle and yet i feel such a ******* for news of miriam and mother and ***** who are in the city that i suppose i am as wild as the rest it is ******** to tell me i am cool with all these ********* and ************ ********** nothing can be ********** *********** save that our gunboats are **** and ****** are coming up to the city everything else has been ************ until we really do not know whether the city has been taken or not we only know we had best be prepared for anything so day before yesterday lilly and i ***** up our ******* which may be of use if we have to *** i *** i will not move one step unless carried away come what will here i remain we went this morning to see the cotton burning a sight never before witnessed and probably never again to be seen wagons ***** everything that can be driven or rolled were ****** with the ***** and taken a few ******* back to burn on the ******* negroes were running around ******* them open ****** them up and ******* them ***** all were as busy as though their ********* ******** on ************* the yankees later ******* sent for us to come to the river and see him fire a ******** ****** with the precious material for which the yankees are ******* their bodies and souls up and down the ***** as far as we could see negroes were ******* it down to the ***** of the river where they would set them ***** and **** the ***** in to ***** burning down the **** each sent up its ****** of smoke and looked like a **** steamer ******* away only i doubt that from the ****** to the mouth of the river there are as many ***** ****** on the mississippi the ******** was ***** with as many ***** as it could hold without ******* most of them were cut open while negroes ****** in the heads of ******* of ******* ******* etc and dashed ********** over the cotton others built up little ******** of pine every few feet ***** with pine ***** and ***** cotton to burn more quickly there ***** the length of the whole ***** or burning in the river lay the work of thousands of negroes for more than a year past it had come from every side men stood by who ***** the cotton that was burning or waiting to burn they either

i wish i could have ******* him for being so *********** of me in my distress now in her ********* lilly gave him a letter i had been writing to george when i was called away and begged him to address

i would not know what to save when i heard ****** voice ********** crying as she ran in she had been out ******** mr ****** has killed a federal officer on a ship and they are going to shell **** went

command her to run lilly ****** and cry she should go the children ********* within women running by without crying and ******* but i could not join in i was going i knew not where it was impossible

minute we were all off in safety a square from home i discovered that boy shoes were not the most comfortable things to run in so i ran back in spite of *********** ********** etc to get another pair i got home found an old pair that were by no means *********** which i seized without ********** and being perfectly at ease thought it would be so nice to save at least ******* and my ************ so slipped them in my ******* these in of course we must have a **** that was added then how could we stand the sun without ****** to cool our faces this ******** the ********* then i must save that

around ones head and here i heard the same peculiar sound ran the same risk and was equal to the rest of the boys for was i not in the midst of flying shells in the middle of a *********** i think i

******* that there was no warning no means of ********** this he cried you are ****** so am i and my brothers too and by there is nothing left but to die now and ill die good i said but die fighting

******* all mention of political affairs but now there is nothing else to be thought of if it is not ***** for ******* i will like to look it over some day if i live i left ********* without ever looking around it beyond one walk to the hotel so i may say i hardly know what it looks like miriam stayed much against her will i fear to bring in our ****** if i could send a wagon a ********* ****** stopped us before we had gone a mile and seemed disposed to turn us back we said we must pass our all was at ***** they then ********* us not to enter saying it was not safe i asked if they

asked if we had no ********** none we said dont go then and they all looked so sorry for us we said we must ********** and another ***** awaited us out there our brothers were fighting our fathers dead we had only our own judgment to **** on and that told us home was the best place for us if the town must burn let us burn in our houses rather than be ******** in the woods they looked still more sorry but still begged us not to remain we would though and one young boy called out as we drove off ***** the name of that young lady who refused the escort i told him and they too expressed the greatest regret that she had not accepted we met many on the road nearly all of whom talked to us and as they were most ********** in their manner though they saw us in a **** **** we gave them all the information we could which was all news to them though very little such a ride in the hot sun ******* up in the air one of the servants remarked miss ***** aint ashamed to ride in a wagon with

rather than have it broken open during her absence ****** and mr ******* were present at the discussion which ended by the latter ******** in the buggy and driving miriam to the garrison general ******** called her by name and asked her about major **** it seems all these people native and foreign know us while we know none miriam told him our condition how our brothers were away father dead and mother afraid to remain yet ********* to lose her property by going away how we three were alone and *********** here but would remain rather than have our home *********** he assured her the

the latter she declined but he said he would send his **** to mark the house that it might be known a moment after they got back the **** mr ****** i have his name to so many passes that i know it now came to the door mr ******* left him there ********* how we would receive a christian and i went out and asked him in he looked ********* of his reception too when we put an end to his doubt by ******** him as we ********** ***** gentlemen who appear such he ******* ********** well under the trying circumstances and insisted on a ******** for he said though they would respect the property there were many bad characters among the soldiers who might attempt to rob it and the ******** would protect it after a visit of ten minutes devoted *********** to the affair he arose and took his leave leaving me under the impression that he was a gentleman wherever he came from even if there were a few *********** ****** in the pass he wrote me yesterday but **** that ******* another **** **** sin well now we say *** to ********* yes and by tonight a most *********** account of the whole affair will be spread over the whole country and we will be equally ********* by our own people those who spread useless ********** about us will gladly have a ********** for a ********* one did ** camp ***** ring with the story of our ************ the federal officers did ** they spread the report that miriam ****** with one to the **** of yankee ****** in the state house garden what will they stop at now o if i was only a man and knew what to do we were so ********** by the false position in which we would be placed by a federal ******** that we did not know what course to ****** as all our friends shook their heads and said it was dangerous we knew full well what our enemies would say if we win baton rouge as i pray we will they will say we asked protection from yankees against our own men are consequently ******** and our property will be *********** by our own government to ******* general ********* kind offer ******* the house to being ********* in our ******* we made up our minds to stay so we could say the ******** was *********** presently a **** of six soldiers marched to the gate an officer came to the steps and introduced himself as colonel ******** of ##** ******* volunteers he asked if this was mrs ******* the general had ordered a guard placed around the house he would ******* ******* them in different parts of the yard madam the ******* ***** your orders miriam in a desperate ****** ********* to speak for mother and asked if he thought there was any necessity no but it was an additional ******** he said then if no ****** necessity we will relieve you of the ************ duty as we expect to remain in town she said he was very kind and ********* the whole affair with us saying when we made up our minds to leave we told him after we could not decide to write him word and he would place a guard around to prevent his men and the negroes from breaking in it was a singular situation our brothers off fighting them while these federal officers leaned over our ***** and an officer standing on our steps offered to protect us these people are certainly very kind to us general ******** especially must be a dear old gentleman he is so good how many good and how many mean people these ******** have shown us i am beginning to see my true friends now there is a large number of them too everybody from whom we least expected attention has ********* surprised us general ******** will believe we are ****** from our ******** so often his guard ********** refused last night i determined to stay miriam went after our ****** at daylight a few hours after lilly wrote we must go back mcclellans army was cut to pieces and driven back to maryland by jackson the federals were being driven into the swamp from richmond too beauregard is *********** coming to attack baton rouge his fire would burn the town if the gunboats do not the yankees will shell at all events if forced to retire it cannot stand we cant go to new orleans butler says he will lay it in ashes if he is forced to ******** it from yellow fever or other causes both must be burned ********* is not worth the ****** it would cost so we must stand the chance of murder and ********** there rather than the ********* of being placed between two ***** here well i see nothing but ********* and ******* ******* us in the face let it come i hope to die ******** the lord will provide we ***** at mrs ******* yesterday and sitting on the gallery later had the full benefit of a yankee ***** they stopped in front of the house and went through some very curious ********** and then marched out to their *********** beyond in returning the whole regiment drew up directly before us and we were ********** quiet for five minutes the most ************* i have *********** for some time for it was ****** to look at the sky and i looked in vain for one man with ******** eyes ******* i might rest mine but from the officers down to the last private they were all looking at us i believe i would have cried with ************* if the command had not been given at that moment they ******* ********** and knew it too so went through it as though they had not been at it for an hour before one ********* ********* lieutenant smiled at us in the most *********** way perhaps he smiled to think how fine he was and what an impression he was making we got back to our solitary house before ******** and were sitting on the ******* when mr ****** entered he came to ask if the guard had been placed here last night it seems to me it would have saved him such a long walk if he had asked colonel ******** he sat down though and got talking in the moonlight and people passing some citizens some officers looked *********** at this ********* ********** i wont be rude to any one in my own house yankee or southern say what they will he talked a great deal and was very ************ what ******* him i cannot imagine it was two hours before he thought of leaving he was certainly very kind he spoke of the ******** of ***** in town said they had ********** at the garrison and asked permission to send us a ****** which of course we refused it showed a very good heart though he offered to take charge of any letters i would write said he had heard general ******** speak of ***** and when he at last left i was still more pleased with him for this kindness to us he says captain ***** is dead i am very very much ********** they are ******* he says he talked so ********** of the war that it was quite a ******* after reading the ******* newspapers of both sides i like him and was sorry i could not ask him to repeat his visit we are ************ to ***** gentlemen that way but it wont do in the present state to act as we please *** ******* mother kept me ***** all night to listen to the **** in the ****** every time i would **** she would ask ***** that and ****** that the **** were men i had to get up and look for an ********* host so i am tired enough this morning miriam has just got in with all the servants our ******* is on the way so we will be obliged to stay whether we will or no i dont care it is all the same ****** or burn oh i forgot mr ****** did not write that pass it was his ***** he ****** very ************* so far as i

in consideration of the present condition of the *********** ******** and the intention was so kind the way it was done so delicate that there was no ******** it i had to write her thanks and got in a

would have occupied two pages to show myself fully and to think it is out of our power to prove them our ************ of the kindness we have *********** met with many officers were in church this

every day since we have been here he has sent a great ******* of milk knowing our *** is out one day he sent **** the next ******** yesterday two ******* of port and ******* which cannot be ********* in the whole south what a **** of an old man that is only one instance this morning while i was ********* to my flowers several soldiers stopped in front of me and holding on the ***** commenced to talk about some brave colonel and a ******** affair last night when all had gone except one who was watching me *********** as he seemed to wish to tell me i let him go ahead the story was that colonel ******** was shot through the shoulder breast and ***** by three ********** while four miles from town last night on a ***** he was a quarter of a mile from his own men at the time killed one

of ******* another ****** ***** the pet of a whole family of good honest country people these soldiers will get in the habit of talking to me after a while through my own fault yesterday i could not

because she happened to have no sense of ******** and no feeling the ******* hour is just before the day we have had the ******** night for almost three months and i dont see the light yet better days

after ******** all things ******* has gone ********** to wait the issue and i dressed for instant flight with my ********** tied to my ***** and ******** ****** veil etc on the bed occupy my last few

in the shadow of the ***** presently ******** still he ran fast towards the front of the house making quite a noise in the long ******* grass when he got near the ********** he drew himself up to his

********* the man walked steadily out closed the gate ************ then suddenly *********** *********** would be the best excuse gave a ***** towards the house walked off perfectly straight in the

who brought the ***** from ****** wished to have it ********* but it was instantly seized by a federal officer who carried it to butler who *********** it so that will never be heard of again we must wait for other means of information the young boy who told us ******* me very much of ***** he is by no means so handsome but yet there is something that ******* him and his voice though more childish sounds like ****** too i had an opportunity of writing to ***** by him of which i gladly ******* myself and have just finished a really tremendous ******* poor miriam poor ***** they are ********* again last night we were all sitting on the ******* in the moonlight singing as usual with our ****** i have been so accustomed to hear father say in the evening come girls where is my ******* and he

hope he was not ******* down by surprise and joined the first his hands sought his ******* too and if possible he looked more ********* than the other after looking for some time at the house satisfied that they had put an end to future singing from the gallery they walked slowly away turning back every now and then to be certain that it was a fact if ever i saw two ********* ************** men they were these two as they took their way home was it not ******** but they could not have meant it merely to be ********* or they would have placed themselves in full view of us

struck their ***** ******** with their cannon through the streets with the most ******** *** troops passed at *********** on their way to the garrison everything was confusion mr ******* told us yesterday he was present when part of them reached the gate of the garrison and saw one of the officers spring forward waving his sword and heard him cry **** men gallop i say **** you run in with a

imagine what effect this had on the *********** soon an ****** took place in the direction of the ****** and we needs must follow the general example and run too in haste we ****** a trunk with our

mother always had one more article to find and the noise was dreadful when white and black assembled in the hall ready at last ******* placed half of the ****** on the **** leaving the rest for

with all these things i could not answer certain it is i had every one in my hands and was not very ********** to ****** ********* in number ******** white and black our ********** started off each ****** in their own way the soldiers did not ******* to laugh at us those who were still waiting in front of the ******** to be removed laughed ******** and cried ***** where are you going running goodbye fortunately they could not see our faces for it was very dark one stopped us under a ******** and wanted us to go back he said he knew we were to be attacked for the confederates were within

get ready while our detachment went on wagons ***** every ******* ********** passed on to places of safety ****** with ********* while women and children hurried on on foot it took the ******* as long to prepare as it did us i had to **** ****** out of her bed where she threw herself ****** she would not run and after an ************ length of time we were at last ready and started with the

passed and then burst out laughing no wonder what a walk it was nobody ********* to laugh even though they meant to run themselves and we made fun of each other too so our walk was merry enough when we reached there the ****** was already crowded at least it would have been a crowd in any other place though a mere ******* in such a building the whole house was *********** up to the fifth story and we were most ********** received by the ******** who had thrown the whole house open to ******* ***** to come and ******* himself to be ************* it looked like a tremendous hotel where every

a great relief then we five girls walked on the splendid ******* which goes around the house until we could no longer walk when i ****** myself by keeping poor ****** standing since she would not sit down like a christian but insisted on going to bed like a **** girl as she is when i finally let her go it did not take her many minutes to ******* and soon we were all ready for bed the ******* had **** on the parlor floor across the wide hall we had a room opposite and next to ours lilly and the children were all sleeping ******* i ran the ******** of the hall in my ********* and had a splendid **** with the girls after ******* ****** out of bed and ******* ****** up mother and mrs ****** cried order laughing but they came in for their share of the ***** until an ******** crowd of ******* at

were *********** so i watched mother and miriam in their ***** ******** and lay on my hard bed for hours fighting the ******** with bare arms every now and then i heard a **** among the ******* above ********** that some few were ************ a ***** once they took a rush from the fourth story and cried they heard the cannon twenty guns had been fired etc i lay still determined not to believe it and presently all ******** i lay there for hours longer it seemed when ****** at last ******** in ************ to find if we were asleep for with the ********* of ****** they too had been ***** all night i went to the parlor with her when she **** and i decided to dress at once and sit on the ******* since sleep was hopeless ****** me in a blue ****** ******** to the ***** with a **** too what a

have no **** year in ## the ********** ***** hours were crowded in on that occasion i think we ********* our favorite books characters ******* repeated ****** here and there of the **** *********** talked of how we would one day like to travel and where we would go ********* love and marriage and came to the conclusion neither was the **** it was thought to be o wise young women poor ****** retired in despair and we two watched alone for hours longer the sun must have been arrested by some ****** on the road could ** make me believe it was doing its duty as usual we ******** around the ********* through the grounds in the dim ********* for it was ****** and finally ********* a faint promise of morning sat still and waited for the coming of the **** sun what was still more *********** was that every time we looked in at the others showed them sleeping ********** miriam lay her full length with ************ arms the picture of ****** looking so comfortable when the sun finally made his appearance he was out on a ***** i found for his eyes were not half opened and he looked **** and heavy as he ****** from behind his bed ******** others began to **** and in an hour

our ****** at all four miles from here we met a crowd of women flying and among them recognized mrs la **** and ***** a good deal of loud ******** brought them to the carriage in great surprise to see

over that poor mans death exclaimed dont know a word about him know ******** was cut to pieces though and that is all we could learn from her we went on until we came in sight of baton rouge there it stood looking so beautiful against the black ******** sky that i could not but regret its fate we could see the garrison state house ****** and all that but the object of the greatest interest to me was the ******* of the ********* church for to the right of it lay home while looking at it a negro passed who was riding up and down the coast ********** **** so i gave him all we had made and commenced some more presently we met mr ******** to whom ******* put the same question he is on the ****** hill a prisoner ******** that negro where did he go and so on each answer as far as ********* her ******* a labor but the part ******** to the servant very ****** poor ******* ********** that everybody was ******* thought only of their own affairs and did not ********** with her yes my dear i silently ******** for it was very true every one seemed to think of their own interests alone it was late before we got home and then we had great fun in watching shells which we could ***** ***** against the clouds falling in what must have been the garrison then came a tremendous fire above which may have been a boat i dont know i hear a tremendous firing again and from the two ******* of smoke should judge it was the ******** and the ***** trying their strength at a distance we are going down to see ***** the fun it would be ****** to record all the ****** that have reached us since we can **** on none they say we fought up to nine last night and occupied the garrison for five minutes when the shells forced us to ******* it also that four regiments laid down their arms that the

was ******** held before a cannon and ***** to pieces for the sake of humanity i hope this is false oh what a sad day this is for our country mother *********** so of our going to the ***** to see the fight that we ********* to remain though miriam and ****** ****** into the buggy and went off alone presently came ******* that all the ******** near baton rouge were ******** their families and negroes and that the yankees were to shell the whole coast from there up to here then ******* lilly ***** and i ****** in the carriage that was still waiting and ran after the others to bring them back before they got in danger but when we reached the end of the long **** we saw them standing on the high ***** ******** their hands and crying we sprang out and joined them and there way at the **** lay the ******** on fire all except myself burst into tears and ************ and prayed aloud between their **** i had no words or tears i could only look at our sole hope burning going and pray silently oh it was so sad think it was our sole ********** and we five girls looked at her as the smoke rolled over her watched the flames burst from her ***** and the shells as they ******** one by

****** of pity on they came ***** *********** some with only their guns others a few with ******* and ********* on their ***** ***** and tired but still laughing we called to the first and asked if

they had succeeded and had sat by their guns all night and this morning as they started to meet the ***** the other ****** had broken how each officer wrote his opinion that it was impossible to fight her with any hope of success under such circumstances and advised the captain to ******* her how they had resolved to do so had exchanged ***** with the ***** across the point and the first of the latter only one also had set ours ***** when the men were ordered to take their side arms they thought it was to board the ***** assembled together when the order was given to fire the ******** and go ****** which was done in a few minutes several of the **** were around us then and up and down the road they were scattered still in ****** miriam must have asked the name of some of the officers for just then she called to me he says that is mr read i looked at the foot of the ***** and saw two walking together i hardly recognized the gentleman i was introduced to on the ***** in the one that now stood below me in rough ****** ***** a pair of ***** and a very thin and ***** ***** ********** that is all he had on except an old ***** hat and yes he held a ****** i did not think it would be ************ to him to meet me under such circumstances i only thought of ****** friend as ******** from a sad fate so i rushed down a ***** twenty feet high saying o mr read you wont recognize me but i am ****** sister he ******* ******** shook my hand as though we were old friends and assured me he remembered me was glad to meet me etc then miriam came down and talked to him and then we went to the top of the ***** where the rest were and watched the poor ******** burn by that time the crowd that had gone up the road came back and we found ourselves in the centre of two hundred men just we five girls talking with the officers around us as though they were old friends you could only ***** they were officers for a ******* more ******* set i never saw not ***** either they looked ***** *********** the work they had been doing nobody introduced ******* else we all felt like brothers and sisters in our common ******** there was one handsome ********** whose name i soon found to be ****** who looked ********** *********** in his ****** ********* ***** white ***** ***** hat black hair ***** and eyes with **** cheeks he was a ******** of the ***** ******* some years ago then another ********** young man from the same ******* pleased me too he the doctor and the captain were the only ones who possessed a coat in the whole crowd the few who saved ****** carrying them over their arms mr read more than once ********** remarked that they were prepared to fight and hardly expected to meet us but we ********* to think there was nothing unusual in his dress i can understand though that he should feel rather ******* i would not like to meet him if i was in the same ******* they all talked over their loss ********** as far as the loss of money ******* clothes were ********* but they were ************ about their boat one threw himself down near my feet saying me **** i have saved my gun ** **** the clothes that i stand in and laughed as though it were an excellent **** one who had been on the ******** ******* ********* the loss of the commission ********** him there though he had not saved a single article the one with the ***** face told me will ******** was among those ********* baton rouge and assured him he expected to take supper there last night he thought it would be with us i know i hope he is safe after a while the men were ordered to march up the **** to some resting spot it is best not to mention here and ********* off but there were many sick among them one wounded at ********* and we instantly ***** to walk the mile and three quarters home and give them the carriage and buggy but long after they left we stood with our new friends on the ***** watching the last of the ******** and saw the ***** and two gunboats crowded with men ********** turn the point and watch her burn what made me furious was the thought of the ******* ******** they would give of their capture of the ******** capture and they fired a shot ****** for all the firing we heard was the ********* of her guns by the flames we saw them go back as ********** and i was furious knowing the ******** they would ******* of what we ourselves had destroyed we had seen many shells ******* and one ******** and would have waited for the other if the clouds had not threatened rain speedily but we had to leave her a mere ***** still burning and started off on our long walk in our ***** i had brought neither ************ nor ****** but hardly ****** either i was so excited mr ****** walked home with me and each of the others with some one else he had a small ****** and a sword and the latter i insisted on carrying it was something to shoulder a sword made for use rather than for ******** so i would carry it he said he would remember who had carried it and the ************ would give it a new value in his eyes and i might rest assured it should never be ********* after that and all that sort of thing of course as it is usual to say it on such occasions but i ********** the sword bravely determined to show my ************ of the sacrifice they had made for us in coming to our ****** on a boat they had every reason to believe was ****** i ***** mr ****** he made himself very agreeable in that long walk he asked permission to send me a ****** from the first action in which he used that sword and did ** i say yes he thought southern men had every ************* in the world from the fact that the ladies ******** them with great kindness in victory or defeat *********** he thought they hardly ******** our ********** after their failure on the ******** but i ******* denied that it was a failure had they not done their best was it their fault the ********* broke and in defeat or victory were they not still fighting for us were we the less grateful when they met with ******* oh did ** i **** the southern men with my whole heart and i think he felt better for it too yes i like him we all met at the steps and water was given to our ********* who certainly enjoyed it we could not ask them in as dr ***** is on his ****** but ******* ********* that if they ***** to order they might do as they pleased as women could not resist armed men so they took possession of the ********** and helped themselves to something to eat and were welcome to do it since no one could prevent but they first stood talking on the ******* ***** and we parted with many warm wishes on both sides ********* that if they ******** at a second attack on baton rouge they must remember our house was at their service wounded or in health and they all shook hands with us and looked pleased and said god bless you and goodbye i heard a while ago the doctor of the *** who brought back the buggy say the ********* **** were about leaving so *********** poor mr read had lost everything mother ********** he might need money gave me twenty dollars to put in his hands as some slight help towards reaching his *********** besides coming from ****** mother he could not have been hurt but when i got down he was far up the **** walking too fast for me to ******** him then i tried to catch mr ********** to give it to him for me but failed presently we saw i am afraid to say how many wagons ****** with them coming from the ********** so ******* lilly and i ******** up some five ******* of *** between us and ran out to give it to them a rough old ****** received mine with a ***** of thanks and the others gave ****** to those behind an officer rode up saying ladies there is no help for it the yankee cavalry are after us and we must fight them in the corn take care of ********** we ******* yes told them to bring in the wounded and we would nurse them then the men cried god bless you and we cried ****** for the ********* **** and fight for us altogether it was a most ********* scene ******* seeing how ****** armed they were suggested a gun which i **** after and delivered to a rough old *** when i got out the **** then passing held mr ****** who smiled ******** and waved his hat like the rest he looked still better in his black coat but the ***** ******** me of what the ********** days must have been in france he ******* goodbye we ******* come to us if you are wounded he smiled and bowed and i cried use that sword ********* he sprang to his feet and ******* the **** as though about to ******** then came other officers mr ****** mr ******** etc who smiled *********** stopped the wagon as ******* handed up a ***** of bread and **** and talked ***** as they divided it until the captain rode up on gentlemen not a moment to lose then the **** started off the empty ***** was ***** ********* and they rode off waving **** and crying god bless you ladies in answer to our repeated ****** of taking care of them if they were hurt and they have gone to meet the yankees and i hope they wont for they have worked enough today and from my heart i pray god ******* those brave men last night ******* after we got in bed we were ****** by loud *********** towards baton rouge and running out on the small ******* up here saw the light of a great fire in that direction from the constant reports and the ********* of what seemed to be several ****** ********* we ******** it to be either the garrison or a ******* whatever it was it was certainly a great fire we all ran out in our ********** and watched for an hour in the **** air i without even shoes we listened to the fight a long while until the sound ceased and we went back to bed i am so ************ i have been listening with the others to a man who was telling us about baton rouge until i am ********* he says the yankees have been ******* reinforced and are prepared for another attack which will probably take place tomorrow that the fight was a dreadful one we driving them in and losing twelve hundred to their fifteen hundred it must have been awful and that our troops have resolved to burn the town down since they cannot hold it under the fire of the gunboats again last night about nine we heard cannon in baton rouge and watched the ******* which ******** the reports by a minute at least for a long time we must have seen our own firing perhaps we wanted to find out the batteries of the enemy it was not the most delightful thing ********** to watch what might be the ******** of our only home and then to think each ball might bring death to some one we love ah no it was not pleasant miriam and i have many friends in ************* division i expect if we could only hear the names of the regiments the fourth is certainly there and poor will i wonder if he has had his supper yet i have been thinking of him ever since mr ****** told me he was there and praying myself sick for his safety and that of the rest i shut my eyes at every report and say oh please poor will and the others too and when i dont hear the cannon i pray to be in advance of the next it is now ****** and again we hear firing but have yet to learn the true story of the first days fight preserve me from the country in such ******** days we might as well be in europe as to have the mississippi between us and town by ********* consent the little **** in front of the house has been ********** ********* **** and the long one leading to the river ******** what an ******* that was in our lives the officers go by the name of ******* ******* ****** as though they belonged to each those girls did me the ******* thing ********** mr ****** and i were ******** a grand ******** attack on baton rouge in which he was to command a ***** and attack the town by the river while i promised to get up a ********* of girls and attack them in the rear we had settled it all except the time when just then all the others stopped talking i went on and now it is only necessary for you to name the day here the girls commenced to ****** and the young men tried to ******** a smile i felt ******* but it did not strike me until after they had left that i had said anything ****** what evil ************ they must have if they could have ******* i meant anything except the battle to our great surprise ******* came in this morning from the other side he was in the battle and general carter and ****** of others that we did not think of see the mountain reduced to a ******** he says though the fight was desperate we lost only ********** killed and less than a hundred and fifty wounded and we had only twentyfive hundred against the yankees four thousand five hundred there is no truth in our having held the garrison even for a moment though we drove them down to the river in a ***** the majority ran like fine fellows but a ***** regiment fought like ****** he says will and ******** bird set fire to the yankee camp with the greatest ******** as though it were rare fun general ******** was killed as he passed ****** by a shot from a window supposed to have been fired by a citizen some one from town told him that the federals were breaking in the houses ********** the furniture and ******* the clothes of the women and children in ****** like ******* o my home i wonder if they have entered ours what a ***** time they would have over all the letters i left in my desk butler has ordered them to burn baton rouge if forced to ******** it looks as though he was not so sure of holding it miss ****** told miriam that her mother attempted to

****** none but we d women had put the men up to fighting and we were the ones who were to ***** for the **** there is no name he did not call us is this really sunday never felt less ***** or less seriously disposed listen to my story and though i will of course fall far short of the ****** terror that ******* yet it will show it in a ******** light that can at least recall the excitement to me to begin then last evening about six oclock as we sat reading ****** and making **** in the parlor we heard a tremendous shell ******** past which those who watched said passed not five feet above the house of course there was a slight **** among the *************** though we who had passed through ************ ****** and ****** of all ***** ****** remarked a shell and kept quiet the latter class was not very numerous it was from one of the three yankee ***** that lay in the river close by the ***** and two gunboats which were ******** ***** provisions and negroes from all the *********** they stopped at from baton rouge up the negroes it is stated are to be armed against us as in town where all those who ****** the cannon on ******* were for the most part killed and served them right another shell was fired at a carriage containing mrs ****** and several children under ******** of *********** if she was a ********* doubtless fortunately she was not hurt however by the time the little ***** had ******** determined to have a ****** miss ******* ****** and i got on our horses and rode off down the ******** **** to have a gallop and a **** at the gunboats from the ***** but mothers ********** prevented us from going that near as she cried that it was well known they fired at every horse or ******* they saw in the road seeing a thousand ********** in every **** of dust and we were sure to be killed ******** and all ***** of bloody ****** awaited us so to ******* her we took the road about a mile from the river in full view however we had not gone very far before we met a mr ****** a plain ****** of the neighborhood who begged us to go back ***** be fired on ladies sure you dont know the danger take my advice and go home as quick as possible before they shell you they shot ******* and ********* and of course they wont mind horses with women please go home but ****** who had taken a fancy to go on ***** as *********** and determined to go on in spite of his advice so nothing ***** to follow her example we ******* him and rode on another met us looked ******** said it was not so dangerous if the yankees did not see the dust but if they did we would be pretty *** to see a shell soon after here was ****** so we rode on some mile or two beyond but ******* to see anything ********* turned back again about two miles from here we met mr ****** coming at full speed the ladies he said had sent him after us in all haste there was a report that the whole coast was to be ******* a lady had passed flying with her children the carriage was ordered out they

what fun in running to a miserable **** when we might sleep *********** here i am afraid ********* was in the air indeed an ******** little negro who threw open the gate for us interrupted ****** in

only said i saw no necessity ****** ******** but finally ********* mr ****** whom we had ******** on our side also said it was by no means necessary but if we were determined we might go to his house about four miles away and stay there it was very small but we were welcome we had in the mean time thrown off our ************ and stood just in our plain ******* though the others were ******* dressed for an ****** before the man left the carriage came though by that time we had drawn half the party on our side we said we would take supper and decide after so he went off in a few moments a

knowing that some at least knew what it was as well as i and determined not to give the alarm for i was beginning to feel ******* before half a minute more came a ******* ******* sound a *********

mr ****** who came ********* up in a few moments crying ladies for gods sake leave the house then i heard mother calling ***** you will be killed leave your clothes and run and a hundred ************ that came too fast for me to answer except by an ********** coming if you will send me a ****** ****** was the same as though i had demanded a *********** in mothers opinion for she was sure it would

was my ********** with all my ********* i was very much ******** at my ************ indeed i cannot imagine how it got there for it was the first thing i thought of when i got back there was no one to

until mr ****** ******** up to **** us on again i had to notice this *********** about women that the married ones are ********** the first to *** in time of danger and always leave the young ones to

******* out of the little ********* buggy when i thought i was safely in and the other half i was surprised to find myself really in when i thought i was ****** out and so on for mile after mile over ***** roads until we came to a most ******** ********* where we were obliged to pass and which is best *********** four miles from town we stopped at mrs ****** to see mother and after a few moments

i stood on the very spot where the ******** struggle had taken place the next turn of the road brought us to two ****** one on each side of the road the ************ of two who fell that day they were merely left in the ***** where they fell and earth from the side was ****** over them when miriam passed parts of their ***** were ******** out of the grave but some kind hand had scattered fresh

across him and both ********* that sight i was spared as the road near which he was ***** was ******* up by trees so we were forced to go through the woods to enter instead of passing by the ******** ********* in the woods we passed another camp our men destroyed while the torn ******** above ********* to the number of shells our men had ****** to do the work next to mr ******* were the remains of a third camp that was burned and a few more steps made me suddenly hold my breath for just before us lay a dead horse with the flesh still hanging which was hardly ********* close by lay a ******** whether of man or horse i did not wait to see not a human being appeared until we reached the ************ which was occupied by our men after that i saw ****** of wagons moving furniture out but not a creature that i knew just back of our house was all that remained of a nice ***** cottage ****** four ********* walls the ******* was that the husband was fighting for the confederates so the wife was made to suffer and is now ******** like many thousands besides it really seems as though god wanted to spare our homes the frame ********* ********* were not touched even the town was hardly ************ and required some skill to avoid the ******* ******* up by trees so as to get in at all our house could not be reached by the front so we left the buggy in the back yard and running through the lot without ******** to examine the ********* and servants rooms that opened wide i went through the ***** and entered by the front door fortunate was it for this record that i ********* to describe the ******* only from ******* account if i had waited until now it would never have been mentioned for as i looked around to attempt such a thing seemed ****** i stood in the parlor in silent ********* and in answer to ******** well i could only laugh it was so hard to realize as i looked for each ********* article i could hardly believe that ******* ******** officers had really come so low down as to ***** in such a ********* manner the ********** ******* miriam had given me was gone the baby ****** i was ********** with all ******** ******* and ***** gone also of all the beautiful ********** of ********* that will ******** had sent me there remained a single one gentlemen my name is written on each not a book remained in the parlor except ***** of the king that contained my name also and which together with the ********* was the only case in which the name of ****** was spared they must have thought we were ******* to john ****** and ******* their ********* on us for that reason thanks for the honor but there is not the ********* connection where they did not carry off articles bearing our name they cut it off as in the ************* and left only the first name every book of any value or interest except **** and ****** was ******** *********** i ********* ******** more than all the rest brothers splendid french ********* went too all except ********* de la ******** however as they spared fathers law ********* all except one volume they used to support a ***** ****** with while they ******* it near the parlor door we ought to be ******** the diningroom was very ***** i looked around for the ******** ****** and preserve ****** that were to be part of my *** as mother always said together with the ********* ******* that had ******* on

i had ******** my hair before as i left home three weeks previously fathers was ***** across and the **** torn off and in the place of the ******** of articles it contained i saw two ******* at the sight of which i actually sat down to laugh one was mothers velvet which looked very much like a ******** in its present condition mine was not to be found as the officers forgot to return it wonder who has my ******** i know they never saw a ********* one with its black velvet purple silk and ******* ******** i went to my room gone was my small ******** had this ******** place ever been ********* the tall ****** ******** at me from a thousand broken ****** it looked so knowing i tried to fancy the yankee officers being dragged from under my bed by the *** thanks to charles but it seemed too ****** so i let them alone my desk what a sight the ******* part i had kept as a little curiosity **** with all my little ******** and ********* of which a large ********** were from my gentlemen friends i looked for all i had left found only a piece of the ***** which as it was ******* in full i was surprised they had spared precious letters i found under ***** of broken ***** and **** all my notes were gone with many letters i looked for a letter of poor in ****** with the key attached and name ****** in plain hand i knew it would hardly be agreeable to him to have it read and it certainly would be ********** to me to have it published but i could not find it miriam thinks she saw something ********* the description somewhere though **** *** what is the use of ********** such a scene many suffered along with us though none so severely indeed the yankees ****** ****** at those who did not leave anything worth ******** they cannot ******** of us on that ***** all our

we drove off again i cast many a ******* look at the ********* but knowing ******* did not want to stop i said nothing though i had been there but once in three months and that once six weeks ago i

general sent the buggy back for mrs carter and myself and soon we were all assembled waiting for the cars at last *********** to wait for them near the ***** we started off again general carter driving me in his buggy i love general carter again after so many kind *********** he told me he was sorry we would not remain with him if we were ******* he would be only too happy to have us with

to a country where i had none at all so could not feel very gay as we reached the ***** the cars came ********* along there was a pause a ******** during which the general placed me and my bird in a

****** great relief for he was too frightened to move even and only ******** a ***** ***** if the car stopped as if to ask is it over nothing occurred of any interest except once a little boy sent us slightly off the ***** by ******** with the ****** ****** at sunset it is hard to fancy a more ******* **** while waiting at the ***** to get the ******* off before coming to the house we burst out laughing as we looked at each ********** face such a ********** through the ********** village has hardly been seen before how we laughed at our ******* ****** as we ******* through the ***** streets they have no ********* here looking like ********* from the **** ******** as we have watched them in new orleans at the house we found ***** laid up the ****** wagon with its ******* four ***** three

afterwards ****** out rather *** in the mud next morning it happened late at night ***** found a **** fancy ****** that she had ******** from the yankees a present from ****** ********* it was and one of two things left in my curiosity **** by the yankees after seeing everything in we started off for the hotel where we arrived after dark rather tired i think not a comfortable house either unless you call a bare *********** ***** room without ******* or anything else comfortable particularly when you are to sleep on the floor with four children and three grown people and a servant after breakfast we came here until we can find a place to ****** in which mr ******* has promised to attend to for us it is rather rough ************ yet but lilly has not yet got settled our dinner was rather ********* there was a ***** and **** to ***** the **** and then it was finished with ****** i sat on the floor with my ***** and a piece of ********* ***** not to be bought at any price and *** with my fingers a new experience i found that water can be ***** out of a cup *** i am tired still no ******** of a ******* so here we remain i never before lived in a house without a ******* and have only now found out how ************ it is the whole ************* ******** of two rooms on each side of a passage as wide as the front door and as it has a very low ******* with no opening and no ***** near it is ********* the ******* spot i ever ********* we all sleep on the floor and keep our clothes in our ****** except lilly who has an ****** without doors ****** and forks for dinner today though the table still ******** of a single plank the house really has a *********** effect on me there is such a close look about it the front is fully a foot below the ***** of the street while quite a flight of steps ***** from the back door to the yard in fact the whole town ******** of ****** little ****** it is rather a pretty place but heaven save me from the misery of living in it miriam is ***** to remain even ********* that ***** bare *********** ************* where we passed the first night from what ********** i cannot imagine i am just as anxious to get into the country i would hate the **** round of this little place i prefer solitude where i can do as i please without being observed here we are as well known by people we never before heard of as though we were ************** i **** up this morning and to my great surprise find that summer has already passed away and that we have already entered the first month of fall where has the summer gone to since the taking of fort jackson the days have gone by like a dream i had hardly realized spring when now i find it is autumn i am ******* to let the time *** though as every day ****** us nearer peace or something else how ********** i write will i ever again have a desk or a table to write on at present my seat is a ******** and my knee my desk and that is about the only one i have had since the 2d of august this is the ********* day i have seen for some time outside it has been ******* since ******** and inside no one ***** especially bright or cheerful i sometimes wish mother would carry out her ****** and brave the ********** ********* at baton rouge i would dare anything to be at home again i know that the yankees have left us little besides the bare house but i would be grateful for the mere ******* of the roof i often fancy how we will miss little articles that we thought necessary to our comfort before when we return and the shoes i paid five dollars for and wore a single time i am ******* i had them now that i am almost ********** and cannot find a pair in the whole country would it not be curious if one of these days while ********* in the north if i ever travel again i should find some ********* object ******** in a strange house as a ****** of the battle of baton rouge i should have to seek for them in some very low house perhaps *********** people had very little to do with such *********** work i fancy suppose i should see fathers ********** for instance or ******* little ******* i wonder if the people would have the conscience to offer to return them a young lady passing by one of the ******** houses expressed her surprise at seeing an ****** full of ****** and ********* clothes being ******* and the contents tied up in ****** what can you do with such things she asked a soldier who seemed more ******* than the rest aint i got a wife and four children in the north was the answer so we who have hardly clothes enough for our own use are ******** to supply *********** one would think that i had no ***** save the ***** of our house if they read this but i take it all out in here i believe i must be made of wood or some other ***** material not to feel it more i sometimes ask myself if it is because i did not care for home that i take it so quietly now but i know that is not it i was wild about it before i knew what had happened since i learned all few are the words that have escaped my lips concerning it perhaps it is because i have the satisfaction of knowing what all women ***** for the worst indeed it is a *********** in such days as these when truth concerning either side is difficult to discover the ********* of anything fortune or misfortune is comfort to me i really feel sorry for the others who suffered but it does not strike me that sympathy is necessary in our case mrs ***** came to ****** room when she heard of it well prepared for sympathy with a large ************ and a ********* of tears when she was ********* to find both her and miriam laughing over the ******* description of some ******* scene that met her sight in one of the rooms seems to me that tears on all occasions come in as the ******** article to the articles of belief of some people political news it would be ****** to record for our information is more than limited being frequently represented by a ***** of the thirteen battles that gibbes has fought in i know the names of four only bull run *********** port ******** and ***** run think of all i have yet to hear today comes the news of another grand affair the defeat of mcclellan pope and burnside ******** if i dared believe it but ******** are too ****** as yet both gibbes and george were in it if there was a fight and perhaps ***** too well i must wait in patience we have lost so much already that god will surely spare those three to us oh if they come again if we can meet once more what will the ******** of the last six months ******* if i dared hope that next summer would bring us peace i always ******** it just six months off but do i believe it indeed i dont know what will become of us if it is delayed much longer if we could only get home it would be another thing but ******** how long will mothers two hundred and fifty last and that is all the money she has as to the ****** ********* to a small fortune she might as well burn them they will never be paid but if we get home what will we do for ******* the yankees did not leave us a single comfort and only two old bars and a pair of ragged ****** which articles are not to be ******** at any price in the confederacy so we must go without how glad i am that we gave all our ******** to our soldiers last summer so much saved from the yankees poor ******* she ******* us *********** settled at home i dare say she ****** all her time in ********* to herself what we may be doing and ********* each piece of furniture the rooms contained wonder if she would not be ******* if the real scene were suddenly revealed to her and she should see the ********* house and see us ********* in a strange town wonder how the cry of where are those three ****** ****** women would have struck her had she heard the strange ***** and seen the eager search which followed i dare say it would have frightened her more than it did me when i was told of it william ****** says it is gods mercy that we had escaped already for we certainly would have suffered i hardly think we could have been ****** though and shall always regret that we did not return immediately after the battle it took them from that day to the ********** to finish the work and i rather think that our presence would have ********* the house our servants they kindly made free and told them they must follow them the officers ******* was ******** the other day of her answer i dont want to be any ****** than i is now ill stay with my mistress when ***** ******** remarked ***** dont you know that if i had gone **** have followed me the

stopped to throw a ****** in charles ******* hands and bade him fight for his liberty charles drew himself up saying i am only a slave but i am a ****** ****** and wont fight in such a d **** **** yankee ********** his flight down to the ********* i hear today that the ******* have returned to baton rouge determined to ***** the grand ****** there they and two other families alone remain with

and mother remains with lilly as she sometimes seems more than half ******** and miriam goes to ******* as she frequently ********* i believe i will take a ****** too and go to mrs ****** i would rather be there in all the *********** ********* to be ******* or ***** out every hour than here *** what a country next time i go ******** i mean to ask some ***** out of curiosity what they do **** in clinton the following is a list of a few of the articles that *********** actually laugh at you if you ask for ******* ***** **** ****** coffee ******* ******* shoes ***** ************* ******** in

spoken about by people i dont know as there goes miss ****** as that young man for instance remarked this morning to a crowd just as i passed it is not ****** to say the least will carter was here

to hear he passed through the very town where we were ******* without knowing it another ***** for ***** **** where will i be in a week or two from this i shall make a mark twenty pages from here and see where i shall be when i reach it here most probably but oh if i could then be at home general carter who spent the evening with us day before yesterday remarked that the first thing he heard as he reached town was that all the gentlemen and ladies of clinton were ******* for country ******** for us it was pretty much the case the general was as kind as ever bless his gray head and made us promise to go back to ******* with him when he passes back next week this is the way we keep the promise coming out here early yesterday morning we received a note from eliza ****** one of our ************* ****** saying her grandmother mrs ***** had ********* to receive us and would come for us in the evening immediately my ******* task was begun but imagine my disappointment just as i had finished one trunk to hear mother ******** her determination to let us go alone while she remained with lilly prayers ********** tears ********* all failed and we were forced to ****** so with a heart ****** than i can express i ******** the trunk with ******* and my clothing and got ready to ****** in the evening the carriage drove up to the door with eliza and her grandmother and with a ***** and rather ***** goodbye to lilly and mother we were hurried in and in another moment were off i ******* the house would be north of clinton so of course the horses took the road south then i decided on a white cottage to the left of the road and about two miles out found that it was to the right not painted and no cottage at all but a *********** building besides t was ever thus from ********** hour when did i ever fancy anything exactly as it was but the appearance does not ****** the house which is really very comfortable though apparently ********** the same ********* might be made to it that i made to mrs ****** for there is not a ******* on the place but fine ***** trees take their place and here i do not feel the want of them so much as our room is in the back of the house to the west where the rising sun cannot ****** my nose as it did at mrs ****** as to what effect the ******* sun has i must wait for the evening to decide though i always enjoy that at ********* we used to walk a mile away from home to see the sun set in an open field i find mrs ***** an excellent plain old lady with neither **** nor *********** and very *********** here she lives alone with the ********* of an orphan girl called jane whose position ********** ********* it would be hard to ****** poor girl the name of orphan alone was enough to make me sorry for her she must be ******* child she is so

assurance that i can only ****** ***** why cannot i have the confidence i see all others possess she took me to the ******** last evening though i could not see much as it was almost sunset when we

wants us to spend a few days with her to see if we like it or if we will be willing to be separated from mother in the mean time we can look around for ******** in a larger and more comfortable place where we can be together she tells such stories about the house lilly lives in of its age and ************* that i am frightened about mother she says she will die if she ***** there this month miriam and eliza have gone to town to see them and are then going to mrs ******* to see if she can *********** us i wanted to have a splendid dream last night but failed it was pleasant though to dream of

********* perhaps general carter will bring us news mrs ****** sent a very pressing invitation for us to spend the next day with her so although it was sunday we went i am becoming ********** *********** i have not been to church since mr ******* went to europe last july it is perfectly ******** but the yankees have kept me running until all ***** ************ have been ****** out of me so

miriam and me to the carriage where we stood talking some time under the trees before getting in he gave us a most pressing invitation to name a day to visit the camp that he might have the pleasure

yesterday the general ******* us with young ladies if you will ride in a confederate carriage you may go to dress ****** this evening now in present *********** confederate means anything that is rough ********** ************* or poor you hear of confederate ******* which means last years confederate ****** means a **** ****** confederate silver a *** cup or ***** confederate ***** is corn **** etc in this case the confederate carriage is a ****** wagon with four ***** a top of ******* ***** covered with ******* and the whole drawn by ***** we accepted gladly ****** for the ride and sight ****** to show we were not ashamed of a very comfortable ********** so with mrs ****** as ******** we went off in grand style i must say i felt rather ******* and wished myself at home as we drove into town and had the gaze of a whole regiment ******* on us but soon the men fell in line and i did not feel so ********* conspicuous i was ****** at a ******** near by too there was but one carriage present besides ours though there were half a dozen ladies on horseback this carriage was a very fine one and in it sat three of the ******* ******** worst dressed ******* i ever saw we three girls sat in our rough carriage as comfortable as could be *********** we could not have been dressed better and looking our very best **** ****** i think the confederates were much the most *********** and what a sad sight the fourth louisiana was that was then ******** men that had fought at ****** and baton rouge were ********** **** was their only uniform for very few possessed a

he who had no shoes looked as happy as he who had and he who had a cap had something to **** up thats all four or five that we knew gathered around our ******* and talked to us mr ******* told me he heard i had been thrown severely ******* had a narrow escape etc was not thrown saddle turned a few steps off we recognized mr ****** he would ***** very hard at us and if we turned towards him would look quickly the other way as though afraid to meet our gaze presently he gave us an opportunity and we bowed he came forward eagerly ******** deeply and looking very much pleased and shook hands with us and remained some time talking he said he had not heard of our arrival but would call as soon as possible mr ****** had joined ************ having seen the last of that ****** he invited us to see that of his ******* which was next but it was too far so we turned off to see colonel ******* a mile away his the ********* louisiana is a beautiful ********** on a large open common ****** was almost over as we reached there and soon the colonel came to meet us i did not look at the ***** i was watching the ******** of ***** it looked like a great many and was ********* how men could live in such

***** that **** in ******* around the ********** just as though they had never had more earnest work one ********** man stood in the door of his tent while a *********** young one ****** before him to

would wonder where twenty pages beyond will find me at home i hope and pray though i am as happy here as i could possibly be in any place on earth ******** news from our armies comes ******* in sunday colonel ****** told me of ***** defeat and the great number of prisoners cannon and the large supplies of stores and ammunition that we had captured then ******* we heard of three great battles in maryland the third one still ********** but no *********** of any of them yesterday came ******* of our having ********* the potomac and today we hear that mcclellans army has been cut to pieces but whether it is the same old fight or a new one i cannot as yet learn for ******** information is not easily obtained in america at this period did i ever record how little truth there was in any of that last clinton news it ****** for itself though not a boat lay at baton rouge camp ***** was not even threatened *********** station was burned but the one battery was ******* by our men the same night but still these false reports cannot equal the yankees take for instance the report of the captain of the ***** i give general carter as my authority the captain reports having been fired on by a battery of ********* large guns at port ****** some weeks ago when he opened fire and ******** them one after the other from the first to the last not a shot from the rebel batteries reached them and not a ******** on their side occurred but the loss of the confederates must have been awful he came within i forget how many yards from the shore and there was not a live man to be seen he did not mention if there were any dead ones now for the other side there were but four guns mounted there at the time shot and shell from those four certainly reached something for one was seen to enter a ******** from whence issued ********* ******* soon after and it is well known that the ***** is so ***** ******* by something as to be in a ******* condition and only kept ****** by a ******* ****** on either side if she is ********* why did she not return and burn ******* as she announced in leaving port ****** where not a live man was to be seen nor a dead one to be found she stopped at mr ****** just below dr ****** where she remained the rest of the day after she left being curious to discover the reason of her short stay mr ***** walked to the place where she had been and discovered ******* fresh ****** on the bank if they buried them as they did at baton rouge and ********* four in a grave how many would they be but ******** there were but ******* would that prove the ******** of the captain poor man perhaps he is ******* to pope and cannot help himself i often wonder how lies first came into the world and whether those who ********* them do not believe them as firmly as any one else would believe truth lying seems to be the common ***** of children and servants anna told me of having heard ******* telling the other servants that she knew there were spirits because i often talked to them every morning and evening i walked to the ********* with a basket of flowers and would sit by fathers and ****** ****** and call their spirits to me and they would all *** to me and talk and sing with me for hours until i would tell them goodbye and go home when they would go away too i suppose the ignorant girl having ********** enough from my ******** visits there which were most often alone made up the rest to account for my never ******* to like company out there the ******* good lord with which the **** was received by the other servants and the full ******** they gave it might have proved ********** if further ********** and i believe some members of the family found it necessary to put an end to it at once and speaking of the ********* ******* something i heard for the first time last night miriam was telling me that ***** had asked if we knew that mr ****** had visited ****** grave that he had got a basket of flowers from the ********* and had made their ****** carry it for him and the man had told her that after ******* the ***** with roses and ********* them over the grave he had thrown himself on it with a ****** of despair calling on ***** to forgive him that it was only because forced by his father that he had killed him and calling on god to prove that he would give his life gladly to recall ****** the man thought him a ****** ****** and fled in terror miriam asked ***** if it was true and she said yes she had gathered the flowers for him herself i saw them there but little knew whose hand had brought them i ********* at once that they were not mine and touched even to tears by so silent an offering from an unknown person i said it is some womans work god bless the hand that laid them there i cannot say how much that little ******* ******** me and mr ****** i do not ******* the blessing now no god have mercy on him has been my prayer ever since i knew what an awful loss you had caused us god knows that i never even desired this ******* ******* standing over his grave it has ever been god pity and forgive never yet for an instant god ****** and ****** we were ****** up at four oclock last night by the arrival of ***** and ****** carter the first from virginia and the second from tennessee and of course there was very little sleep for any of us so anxious were we to hear the news they brought first i learned that gibbes was safe up to the ##** that george in spite of the advice of his surgeon had ******** stonewall jackson in maryland and ***** was ********** on the ******** ******** state at charleston how ******** i was to hear that much i need not say ***** said they all three looked ********** well ***** ********* than ever after that news of all ***** came **************** the boys were very anxious about us but had no idea of our *********** or *********** they believed us still in baton rouge and feared we had been there during the battle ***** only heard of our house having been ********* when she reached alabama so of course they are still ignorant of it they were all very ******** but said that we were their only trouble a few of the ** stories had reached them through brother officers and george ***** to make himself understood by those ladies if he ever saw them again a gentleman from ******* ***** told ***** that they never tired of ********* their stories to every new arrival and no man was suffered to ****** without having heard a few if a gentleman friend of ours or the boys ******** if they knew the miss ******* of baton rouge oh yes would be the answer ********** but you know they have turned yankee received federal officers every day and placed all their property under yankee protection i or my sister as it happened who was ********* the lie meaning mrs s slept in their house when it was surrounded by a yankee guard oh they are perfectly in favor of the yankees and so on think of a common low soldier who stopped for ********** somewhere where anna was *********** the subject it is all false anna interrupted the man answered oh miss you dont suppose we believe it we would not believe such stories of any young ladies much less these for if they are true their conduct must have been perfectly *********** but though we know these stories to be lies it does not prevent their being ********* in camp ***** saw mr *** too at lynchburg who sent me his ******* poor fellow he says he still has dreams he told her a few but she says they were ******* about meeting me at a ball when i always treated him with the most ******** ******** the same old ********* how often he has told me of that same dream that ********* him eighteen months ago he says he often thinks of me now and he still dreams of me dreams are ******** ******* whose

dr ******* i was very much pleased with and so were all the rest mr m none of us fell *********** in love with he is too ********** and *********** besides having a most peculiar ************* which

across the point from the ***** they expected every instant to see one of her shells ******* among us and were very ****** about our position as we did not seem to know the danger i asked him if he had observed anything peculiar among the dozen ******** and ********* standing a short distance from us when the captain sent us word that our position was a very dangerous one as they expected the ***** to open fire every instant and we had best stand below the ***** higher up where we would be safe from shells i noticed that before any of you understood your position every man had disappeared as though by ***** now i had noticed that myself when i turned under ******* of the ***** our gallant ******** were ********* off in the distance while ****** and i looked and laughed we suddenly found ourselves the sole ******* on the ******* the other girls were in the road below going ********** toward the carriage so we followed having lost sight of the brave representatives of southern

****** paid my hair the most *********** *********** he said he could not say his prayers for looking at it in church sunday before last perhaps that is the reason st **** said a woman should not

a very ****** evening for ******** at four it would have been very ********** to ride that distance with the sun in our faces as we reached the town we heard the loud report of two cannon which caused

however at the first one we stopped at the **** of the ******** were ******** after ******** a while there we followed the river to see the batteries below it was delightful to ride on the edge of a

to her **** while i was on such a fine horse until i proposed an exchange and gladly dismounted near an old mill two miles and a half below port ****** as we returned home in leaving the town we lost sight of the ******* as there was no carriage road that might follow the ***** and though there was one just back we never saw our ******* again once following a ******** far below us lay the water battery concealed by the trees that grew by the waters edge looking from where we stood like quite a formidable ********* then still beyond after leaving the river we passed through a camp where the

road and another camp where more men ****** and ****** their supper we came to the last battery but one which lay so far below that it was too late to visit it we returned ****** delighted with what

our guests at the *********** where none of us wanted for an ******** except poor captain ******** who could not be ******* by the ****** we so much ******** after supper colonel ****** and i got into

though he says he could not speak a word of english at ******** the discussion commenced by some remark i made about *********** he took it up and passed on to ********** in which he is no great

******* to get our pass in order to avoid the crowd that might be there eager to leave the present one for a more retired spot i exclaimed oh no let us go ourselves we cant get in a worse crowd i meant a greater but captain ****** looked so ********* at me that i could scarcely laugh out an ******* while he laughed so that i am sure he did not listen to me what a ******* mouth i ***** him very much this time he promised to come out today or tomorrow and have a game of **** wants a corner in the ********** but now i cant join in though it was to me the promise was made but to the *********** at once as we left we insisted on taking gibbes to get our pass and made him get into ******* buggy where there was space for him to ***** and drive i was to carry out my promise to mr ****** we had to pass just by the camp of the first alabama colonel ********* where the whole regiment was on ****** we had not gone thirty yards beyond them when a gun was ********** the horse instantly ran off i dont believe there could be two ****** *********** than mrs ****** and i were i had every confidence in her being able to hold him so long as the ****** ****** i had heard that there was more danger in ******* at such moments than in remaining quiet so i sat still there was nothing to hold to as it was a ***** or what i call a ******* buggy so my hands rested quietly in my lap presently i saw the left **** **** close to the horses mouth i knew all was over then but did not utter a word death seemed ********** and i thought it was as well to take it ****** the horse turned ******** i felt that something ******** me out followed the ******* saw mrs ******* white **** ********** above me received a blow on the ********* of my ***** that i thought would kill me before i reached the ground landing however on my left *** and quietly ********* on my left ***** with my face to an ***** buggy whose ****** **** around in empty air i heard a rush as of horses i saw men ********* up i would have given ****** to spring to my feet or even to see if they were exposed but found i could not move i had no more power over my ***** than if they were iron only the intense pain told me i was still alive i was perfectly conscious but unable to move my only wonder was why miriam who was in front did not come to me my arm was giving away ***** as through a **** or dream i saw a soldier ******* over me trying to ***** me the horse he had ****** from rushed up to his master and ****** up over me i saw the iron ***** shining above my body death was certain this time but i could not move he raised his arm and struck him and ******** to the blow the animal turned aside and let his feet fall without ******** me mrs carter when she heard it described offered a ******** *** for a correct drawing of that most interesting ******* the gallant ********* ********** a helpless form on one arm while he ****** in a fiery ******* with the other i was not aware of the ******* i was conscious only of the ********** situation ****** crowded around and if i had been a girl for ******* here was an opportunity for thirty pair of soldier arms were stretched out to hold me no gibbes gibbes i whispered and had the satisfaction of being *********** from a strangers to my cousins arms gibbes trembled more than i but with both arms clasped around me held me up but for that i would have returned to my original ********** position send for the doctor cried one a surgeon quick cried another tell them no i ******** i was conscious of a ******* of ***** and cloud of dust one performed a **** never heard of before he brought a glass of water at full gallop which i instantly ******* by way of ************** i think i felt the ********** situation more than the pain not being accustomed to being the centre of ********** i was by no means pleased with the ***** experience miriam held my hand and ********** me with a voice ********* with fear and laughter anna ************ ****** or ******* some question i felt the ********** position as much as they laughing was agony but i had to do it to give them an excuse which they ******* seized to give **** to their feelings and ********** by seeing it several ******** officers joined in constantly *********** to ********* or check themselves with a really miss it may seem ********* but it is impossible the rest was lost in a **** and a ******* between ********** and the desire to laugh i dont know what i was thinking of but i certainly paid very little attention to what was going on i only wanted to get home away from all those eyes and my most earnest wish made me forget them the first remark i heard was my young ********* crying it is the most beautiful ******** i ever saw indeed it could not be more ********** done your feet did not show *** but it was just what i wanted to know and dared not ask some one ran up and asked who was hurt and i heard another reply i am afraid the young lady is seriously ******* only she wont *********** it it is worth while looking at her she is the ******* most ********* girl you ever saw and another was added to the already too numerous audience poor mrs ****** having suffered only from torn clothing received very little sympathy while i got more than my share i really believe that the blow i received was from her two hundred and forty ***** body though the ********* ******** he saw the *********** buggy strike me as i fell to her and others i am ******** for the ********** of many a remark that escaped me one bold soldier boy exclaimed madame we are all ******** but we cant equal that it is ****** than any man i had to laugh occasionally to keep my spirits up but miriam ordered me to **** saying that i would go off in ********* i had previously ********** declared to the doctor that i was not hurt and seeing him **** and hearing ******* remark the ********* i am told cried o doctor doctor cant you do something is she going to have ********* really said the doctor the young lady ******* to being ******** but as far as i can judge she has no ***** broken everybody ordered me to confess at once my ****** but how was i to ****** a whole crowd that i had probably broken the *** of my ******** and could not possibly sit down so i ******* to my first *********** and made no ********* when they ***** the ******** up and made gibbes put me down for i knew he must be tired i am told i remained there an hour i know they talked to me and that i answered but have not an idea of the subject a gentleman brought a buggy and offered to drive me home but a captain ****** insisted on running after the ********* arrived there mr ****** says he rushed in crying for gods sake general ***** **** me the ********* there is a dreadful accident and i am afraid the young lady will die coming back he exclaimed by **** boys if you want to see a sight run down and see her hair the ********* ****** you ever looked at and ****** the ground would ** mind such a fall if i had such hair to show come look at it do mr ****** says he was sure that it was i as soon as hair was mentioned and started out as soon as he had finished a duty he had to ******* my ****** a purple silk ****** lay in the centre of the ring by the ********** silence observed i saw they recognized its use so ********* to leave such a ***** behind i asked aloud for my ****** ********* anna says the officers ******* each other and smiled up came the ********* and i was in ******** danger of being carried to it when with a desperate effort i ******** my feet with ******* help and reached it without other assistance beyond i could do no more captain ****** got inside and several others lifted me up to him and i sank ********** on the floor all bade me goodbye and my little ********* assured me that he was proud of having been the first to assist me president ****** whispered to mrs ****** for permission to accompany us which she ******* granted and raising me on the seat he insisted on putting his arm around me to hold me up it was useless to ******* now miss ****** i assure you i am an old married man i know you are suffering let me have my way and the kind old gentleman held me so *********** and broke the force of so many ***** that i was forced to ****** and *********** that had it not been for him i could not have ******* the rough road at the gate that ***** to general ****** headquarters i saw half a dozen figures standing one was frank ****** who ****** the ****** hush said one i recognized as captain ****** the young lady is in there and the ******* too i dont care if it is jeff davis i ** find out if she is hurt he answered miriam and anna recognized him as they followed behind us and called to him without more *** he ****** into their buggy finding them alone and drove them home he asked me something as he passed but i could not answer the road was dreadful once the ****** ******* it and drove us within two steps of an ********** six feet high but discovered the mistake before the horses went over what i most ******* was ************ when we should ****** miriam stepped out an instant before and i heard her telling the

picked me up and ****** me on the gallery he wanted me to lie down in old mrs ******* room but ********* that once there i could not get up and feeling that perhaps the gentlemen would take advantage of its being on the ground floor to ******* calling on me i ********* upstairs with ****** assistance a dozen hands ********* me and laid me on my face in bed which position i have occupied up to the

of course she is ********* at the accident of that unfortunate ***** i think i grow no better rapidly fortunately on ********* night they succeeded in turning me over for my poor ****** having lost all their **** were completely used up now if i go slowly and carefully i can turn myself at the cost of some little suffering yesterday colonel ******** of the first alabama called with his father he

interrupted yesterday morning by mrs ****** who wished to ***** a few dry **** to my back to which i quietly submitted and was unable to move afterwards without pain as a ****** for my patience but towards sunset came two dear letters that made me forget what i had suffered one from george and one from ***** ***** ******** for the first time i know what my dear little brother suffered during those long months when we could not hear if he were dead or alive he kept the secret until he no longer needed either friends or money and now he tells it with a ********** that made me cry fit to

******* of ******** ******* at jackson for the benefit of the soldiers hospital and of course it would be ****** to stay away particularly as anna is a great deal better and i need no care it would be only the ****** ******** i agreed to with ****** of fun and nothing more so i tried to be merry and ******* and so i should have been for there was ****** to talk about and every one was so ********** for my comfort and there was mr ****** who would ***** my chair for me wherever i wished it and was as kind and ********* as a brother surely my first trip should have been a gay one miriam sat down by the piano mr ****** drew me by her and we three sang until dark together a mr ***** his wife and mother who are ******** a week here were our audience the first two retired at *********** while the

whispered that the minister and mrs ***** might not hear if it were your sister what would you do my god ** meet him on the front gallery and **** him out then ** know one of us must die tomorrow but under the circumstances it is impossible for gibbes to act i urged while we agreed that it was the most ************* piece of ********* ever *********** while we talked gibbes had seized miriam and without *********** or ******** further advised her to keep her room and not meet will but i ******* the most important part she came back when she had recovered her ********* and sat by me mr ****** when i asked what was best to do whispered that to spare ***** feelings and avoid a most painful scene as well as to show that she had no serious ********** whatever she should see that the minister was put in full possession of the facts before it went any farther he felt ****** his ********** situation and it was only our earnest request that induced him to remain or give his advice who should explain certainly not the general he thought the **** carried too far and retired to his room before mr g came how take part against his own ****** not gibbes either for he had gone upstairs too ******* and ******* to talk to any one besides it was his ***** cousin who then miriam is one woman in a thousand rising she crossed the room slowly and as ********* as though she only meant to warm

********** he went down and told will he would not go of course will went off in a rage with us monday dr woods and mr *** ***** stopped just from their regiment in kentucky and on their way home and

going down and then did ** it ******* his ****** o men you vain ********* a woman would receive a whole ***** of hair and forty thousand ******** without having her head turned while you well i heard enough from miriam to ***** me at all events and a day or two after captain ******** had a long story to tell her what he called a good **** on mr ****** of how he had found him ******* three long bright ***** in ******* and on asking where he got them received as an answer from the ************* little angel that ever wore long hair this ********** little angel did not intend it as a ******** and is consequently ******* about stories of three ***** intended as a ****** and nothing more being wrapped in ****** paper and ********* up so goes the **** instead of being thrown into the fire as i certainly expected last night anna and miriam sat on my bed at ******** playing ***** while i tried my ****** when captain c major ******** and lieutenant **** were announced quick down went the ***** as they sprang to their feet to throw off their **** ******** where was ******* **** and ********* and ****** and **** good ******** where was her ****** on the ****** ****** ********* or under

out of such confusion and if the people ********** were worth all that trouble when i finally made my appearance in the parlor it was with the ********** that i would have a ********** ****** time and captain c too however though at first i had both soon only the last was left me some one suggested calling the spirits which game i had ******** played out long ago and we ******* a great deal of ********* from it six of us around a small table ******* them with the usual ceremony there was certainly no ***** played every finger was above the board and all feet sufficiently far from the single *** to ****** fair play every *** seemed to come exactly from the centre of the table and was ********* ******** though not loud when asked if there was a writing ****** present it indicated captain c i observed that he seemed ****** to trying it but yielded at length and took the ****** in his hand **** our first question of course was how long before peace nine months was written which foreign nation would recognize us first france then england in eight months who was miriam to marry captain of a battery who we all ******* captain c e ****** was written again when in ten months i believe captain c to be honest about it he seemed to have no control over his hand and his arm trembled until it became exceedingly painful of course i do not actually believe in ************ but there is certainly something in it one cannot understand and mrs ******* experience is enough to ******* one alone each was startled in turn by extraordinary *********** concerning themselves gibbes was to be *********** to the **************** department george would come home and all the gentlemen had the name and address of future *********** written in full the question was asked who will ***** ****** fall in love with every eye was on the ****** as a capital h was ****** as the a followed i confess to a decided ******* at the spirits and was about to beg it might be ************ when the rest followed rapidly until in three separate lines appeared has not seen him yet here came an *********** of surprise from ***** and miriam who knew how true it was and even gibbes looked ********** captain in virginia captain charles ***** a perfect **** of ******** followed every one asked every one else if they knew any one by that name and every one said no gibbes was ********* more interested than i that *** has not seen him yet ********** so exactly the fact that i pride myself upon carried ********** in the truth of spirits almost who will she marry asked gibbes he has a pet belief in which i ********* him that i will never marry again came the name as distinctly as before of captain charles ***** when will she marry him in june 1864 was the answer i was to meet him in new orleans november followed after a period of course the spirits produced some slight ********* which made the time pass ********** until miriam began to ***** with her ******** **** ***** then captain c told me why he had been ********* to try it of how his father believed so ******** in it that he had very nearly been made ***** by it and how he had ***** to ******* the practice of ********** them seeing the effect produced he did not believe in spirits himself but could not account for the influence he was under when he saw his hand ************* write things he was ******* *********** of himself however he proposed that we two should have a private ************ with them which i opened by asking when i should again see my home i know he did not know anything about it but on the paper appeared five months have gone five months more it is just five months since i did see home i think it was the ##** of august that ******* took me there he asked if he should ever marry never you will be ****** by the lady you love in missouri miss ********* p i pointed it out to him as he happened to be looking at me when it was written it surprised him into saying why ** engaged to her i asked whose spirit was ************* with us he was watching the dance when his hand wrote john c i laughed and asked if there was such a person ******** to the name he looked actually sick as he said yes my brother he is dead i had not the heart to talk of spirits again so we took to writing ****** together every ********* line falling to my lot it made an *** ****** the *********** first line being turned to broad ***** by my ****** second one a letter from ******* has come to me all the way from ********** how happy it made me though written so long ago only the 30th of june ******* has changed changed there is a sad ******* tone in every line it sounds old as though she had lived years and years ago and was writing as though she were dead and buried long since ******* whose letters used to keep me in sunshine for weeks at a time well no wonder she is sad all these dreary years from home with so faint a hope of ever again seeing it and all these ******* and ******** that have ******** us ******** are not ********** to make her happy but i wish she had kept her cheerful heart well perhaps it is ****** for us to be cheerful and happy knowing the full extent of our ********** than it is for her knowing so little and having just cause to fear so much courage better days are coming and then ill have many a ***** **** to tell her of the days when the yankees kept us on the *** **** or made us run for our lives it will tell ******* be almost as ****** as those running days were one of my chief ******* over my ************ is that i will not be able to run in the next ******** i used to enjoy it oh the days gone by the dreary days when cut off from our own people and surrounded by yankees we used to catch up any ***** of news favorable to our side that was ******** into town and the ******* and i would write each other little ********** of *********** and send them by little negroes those were ****** days yet how my

where we were expected the gentleman is a friend of gibbes though i had never seen any of them before such a delightful place with everything looking so new and cool and such a ********** ******* that

him with the ****** etc while he hurried out after me i was looking ******** at the ************* step which separated me from the ******** the question of how i was to carry out my independent ******* began to ******* me allow me to assist you said a voice at my ***** i turned and ****** the handsome officer thank you i think i can get down alone pray allow me to **** you over this place much obliged but your arm will ******* ***** let the gentleman carry you you know you cannot walk said my very ******** mother i ************ declined the renewed offer dont pay any attention to her

or taking me by my arms i was so frightened that i have but a ******** idea of it i was lifted over the *********** **** and ****** on the ******** hammond ****** of four houses one a **** *********** stood about twenty or thirty yards off and there the gentleman proposed to conduct me again he insisted on carrying me and ********** ******** i pronounced myself fully equal to the walk and ********* his ********* arm walked off with dignity and ************** he must have ******* that the ****** was in my hand for holding my arm so that my entire weight must have been thrown on him not satisfied with that support with his other hand he held mine so ************ and so carefully that i could not but smile as it struck me which by the way was not until i reached the house *********** that he belonged to colonel ********* command i asked him to take mr ****** the note i had written an hour before he pronounced himself delighted to be of the ********* service and seeing that we were strangers ********* *********** asked if we had secured a ********** to take us beyond we told him no he ******** suggested that some gentleman might attend to it for us he would be happy to do anything in his power i thought again of mr ****** and said if he would mention we were in hammond he would be kind enough to see to it for us may i ask your name he asked evidently surprised to find himself asking a question he was dying to know i gave him my **** ********* mother asked his name which he told us was ****** we had been talking for some ten minutes when feeling rather ************* at being obliged to look up at such a tall man from my low seat to relieve my neck as well as to ***** my face from any further ******** i put down my head while i was still speaking instantly so quietly naturally and ************* did he ***** down by me on one knee so that his face was in full view of mine that the action did not seem to me either singular or *********** in fact i did not think of it until mother spoke of it after he left after a few moments it must have struck him for he got up and made his parting bow ********* as i afterwards heard to question ***** as to how i had been hurt and ********* that it was a dreadful ******** to ****** to so lovely a young lady having nothing to do i may as well go on with the history of our ********** when the cars were moving off with the handsome mr ****** mother turned to a gentleman who seemed to own the place and asked to be shown the hotel he went out and presently returning with a chair and two negroes quietly said he would take us to his own house the hotel was not comfortable and without listening to ************* led the way to a beautiful little cottage where he introduced his wife mrs **** who received us most ********** and had me in bed before five minutes had ******* i dont know how any one can believe the whole world so ****** for my part i have met none but the ******* people ********** i dont know any

*********** the *********** he asked where i was hammond this is her name replied the other extending to him my **** thinking as he ******** ********* that i had intended it only for him mr ****** ****** put it into his pocket and called for his horse mr ****** ******** still apparently having something to say which he found difficult to put in words at last as the other prepared to ride off

******* i should imagine and rode on to the village leaving as he ***** mr ****** looking ********* after the ***** dog who was going to see such a young lady he told me something that slightly ********* me with captain ******** it was that when he reached the ******* the next morning after leaving ******* the captain had put him under arrest for having stayed there all night it was too mean *********** that it is more than probable that he himself remained at mrs ******* we discovered too that we had ****** two letters mr ****** had written us which of course is a great disappointment one written to both the other a short note of ten pages for me which i am sure was worth reading it was not until after sunset that we exhausted all ****** of conversation and mr ****** took his leave ********* to see us in the morning and to be sure as soon as i was dressed on saturday he again made his appearance followed soon after by the carriage taking a cordial leave of mrs **** with many thanks for her *********** we entered our ********** and with mr ****** riding by the side of the carriage went on our way he was to accompany us only as far as *********** some six miles but the

up and ***** it into the ***** i have since found i had cause to be grateful for just after came an officer to see the young lady who brought that letter i showed the pieces in the water saying the

another pause he ********* his head and told us to hold up our right hands ********** i covered my face with mine and prayed ************ for the boys and the confederacy so that i heard not a word he

***** we thought it would go on forever at last we came to the ***** in the centre of the city here was a position for ladies sitting like ***** ********* on their earthly *********** and coming in a

********* ******** and ***** to send to him and ******** i sent a note with it it only contained the same offer of assistance and i would not object to the town ****** reading it but it ***** brothers

to him for his ********** that i was almost hurried into a story i began it is the first time when i caught myself and said ****** no it is not colonel ******** has written to me before and i have replied but i promise to you it shall not ***** again if i can avoid it he was satisfied with the ************** and i was more than ********* with his kindness yet the ***** must have been on the

there was no **** in either note and though i would not do it again i am almost glad i let him know he still had friends before brother asked me not to write and as yet we cant see them a man was ********* yesterday for waving to them even it only makes us the more eager to see them we did see some walking on ******* street with the ******* yesterday in front of a splendid private house we saw ********* stationed upon ******* we learned that general ******** and a dozen others were confined there *** and miriam went wild if it had not been for ********* ***** and that ***** of *********

we are dying to show these ************ that we are as proud of their ******* as though it had led to victory instead of defeat banks ***** that they remain in ******* consequently our ***** ************ are constantly occupied in ********* their ********** ********** ******* and ******** ******* until they have almost become as ******** to us even ****** little captain c has a share of

******** requested me to beg you to call that he will not take a ******* but ********* you to come if it were only once the ***** must be against me i had almost forgotten his existence and having received the same message frequently from another i ************* said you mean colonel do you not fortunately miriam asked the same question at the instant that i was beginning to believe i had done something very ******* the lady looked at me with her calm ************ ************ smile a smile that had all the ********** ************ eyes and lips can ****** a smile that looked like i have your secret you cant ******* me and said with her ******** gaze no not the colonel he was very ill that day did you know it and could not see us this was really the captain he is very kind i ********* and suggested to miriam that we had better pass on the lady was still ****** me ************* ********* this is ********** to have the reputation of being engaged to a man that every girl is ***** to

a ******** this report has cost me more than one *********** ***** the young ladies think it a very ******** position let some of them ***** it then so the young lady not having finished her

my mental comment can a man respect a woman who ******* him her ***** ******* for a ********** the first time they meet what ***** they must think us if they take such as these for ********* of the ***** did we know captain ****** know him no but how ******* his face comes before me when i look back to that grand ******* at port ****** when his face was the last i saw before being thrown and the

as i saw it then no i did not know him he had spoken to me ******* to be allowed to hold me and i had answered ********** him not to touch me and that was all i knew of him but she did not wait for the reply she hurried on to say that she had sent him a ******* with a piece of ****** and that he had been heard to ******* how beautiful on reading it and do you know she continued with an air that was meant to be ********** *** but which was not very successful as ***** at ********** is rather **** i am so much afraid he thinks it original i forgot to put ********* ***** and it would be so ***** in him to make the mistake for you know i have not much of the of that sort of thing about me i am not a poet ******* author you know said miriam in her ******** tone without a touch of ******* in her voice oh if he has ever seen you the mistake is natural if i had spoken my voice would have carried a ***** in it so i waited until i could ****** say you know him well of course no i never saw

******* and join in a game of **** the ****** with the children to forget my ********* of course a woman is at the ****** of it last night while *** and ***** were here a young lady whose name i ******* to ****** for the sake of the *** stopped at the door with an english officer and asked to see me in the ***** i had met her once before remember this for that is the chief cause of my ***** of course they were invited in but she declined saying she had but a moment and had a message to ******* to me alone so led me apart of course you know who it is from she began i told a ********** ********* and said no though i ******* instantly she told me the name then she had visited the prison the day before and there had met the individual whose name joined to mine has given me more

he had written ********** to me without receiving an answer and at last had written again in which he had used some *********** which he feared had ******** my reserved *********** something had made me ***** for without returning letter or message to say i was not ********** i had ********** a ******** silence which had given him more pain and ********** than he could say that during all this time he had had no opportunity of ********** it to me and that now he begged her to tell me that he would not ****** me for ****** that he ******* me more than any one he had ever met that he could not help saying what he did but was ********** at ********* me etc the ******* explanation and she was directed to beg me to explain my silence and let him know if i was really ******** and also leave no ******** or ******** ******* to ****** me to visit the prison he must see me as to visiting the prison i told her that was impossible o how glad i am that i never did but as to the letters told her to assure him that i had not thought of them in that light and had passed over the *********** he referred to as **** words it would be ********** to take ******* at and that my only reason for *********** in this silence had been that brother *********** of my writing to gentlemen and i had promised that i would not write to him that i had feared he would *********** my silence and had wished to explain it to him but i had no means of doing so except by breaking my promise and so had preferred leaving all explanation to time and some future opportunity but you did not mean to pain him did you the dear little creature ********* ****** standing on ****** to kiss me as she spoke i assured her that i had not he has been *********** ill she continued ************* and ******** has made him more ****** and more unhappy about it than he would otherwise have been it has ********** him a great deal i felt ********* how was it that this girl meeting him for the first and only time

********* to me for his ************* and to ******* me to tell him he had not ********* my ****** as though she was his most ******** friend and i a passing acquaintance ******* to ********** it i ******** it to a ******* moment to think over and in the mean time ******* myself to be ******* i cant say half she spoke of but as she was going she said then will you give me permission to say as many sweet things for you as i can think of ** going there tomorrow i told her i would be afraid to give her ***** ******* on such a subject but that she would really ****** me by ********** about the letters she promised and after another kiss and a few whispered words left me ***** she *********** though ************ as the *********** was it was a *********** i was ********* to believe that any

******* and that he had not been ****** of such ***** presently it grew ******* to me i must be growing in ********** to ****** that of others i who so short a time ago *********** in the very

with him o my ********* soul part of your *********** are already ******** and in what an ********** way day before yesterday an english officer not the one who came here but one ******* unknown to me said at mrs ******* he was going to visit the confederate prisoners he was asked if he knew any slightly he said but he was going this time by request he had any ******** of ******** to ******* to

i cant repeat it i was too ********* to hear all when they told me what struck me as being most ******** was my ********* explanation about the letters it now set forth that i was not allowed to write

miriam rushed in holding an open letter in her hand and perfectly wild george is dead she ******** and fell heavily to the ground o my god i could have prayed **** to take mother too when i looked at

trying in vain to ****** her from her horrible state or bring one *** of reason to her eye i spoke to a body alive only to pain not a sound of my voice seemed to reach her only fearful ***** showed she was yet alive miriam lay ****** on the ground poor miriam her hearts **** torn away god help my darling i did not understand that george could die until i looked at her in vain i ****** to ***** her from the ground or check her wild ******* for death george only george she would cry until at last with the horror of seeing both die before me i ******** strength enough to go for the servant and *** her run quickly for brother how long i stood there alone i never knew i remember *** coming in ********* and asking what it was i told her george was dead it was a relief to see her cry i could not but i felt the pain ****** as though it were her brother she was crying over not mine and the sight of her tears brought mine too we could only cry over mother and miriam we could not ***** them we did not know what to do some one called me in the ***** i went not ************* what i was doing a lady came to me told me her name and said something about george but i could not follow what she said it was as though she was talking in a dream i believe she repeated the words several times for at last she shook me and said listen ***** yourself the letter is about george yes i said he is dead she said i must read the letter but i could not see so she read it aloud it was from dr mitchell his friend who was with him when he died telling of his ******** and death he died on ******* the ##** of january after an illness of six days conscious to the last and awaiting the end as only a christian and one who has led so beautiful a life could with the grace of god look for it he sent ******** to his brothers and sisters and bade them tell his mother his last thoughts were of her and that he died ******** in the mercy of the ******* george our pride our beautiful angel brother could he die surely god has sent all these *********** within these three years to teach us that our hopes must be placed above and that it is ********* to have earthly ***** the letter said that the ********** had mistaken his ****** which was ************ of the ****** and he had died from being treated for something else it seemed horrible ******* to read me that part i knew that if mother or miriam ever heard of it it would kill them so i begged mrs mitchell never to let them hear of it she seemed to think nothing of the pain it would ******* how could she help telling if they asked she said i told her i must ****** on her not ********** it it would only add suffering to what was already ************* if they asked for the letter offer to read it aloud but say ********** that she would not allow any one to touch it except herself and then she might pass it over in silence i ****** miriam then and sent her to hear it read she insisted on reading it herself and half dead with grief held out her hands ******* ********* to be suffered to read it alone i watched then until i was sure mrs mitchell would keep her promise horrible as i knew it to be from strange lips i knew by what i *********** that i had saved her from a ***** that might cost her her life and then i went back to mother no need to ******* what i felt there she neither spoke nor saw if i had ******** that he died of ill ********* she would not have understood but i sat there silently with that horrible secret ********* if god would help me bear it or if despair would ******* me of *********** and force me presently to cry it aloud though it should kill them both at last brother came i had to meet him ********** and tell him god spare me the sight of a strong mans grief then sister came in knowing as little as he poor sister i could have blessed her for every **** she shed it was a comfort to see some one who had life or feeling left i felt as though the whole world was dead nothing was real nothing existed
