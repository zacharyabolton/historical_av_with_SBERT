upon the floor as to this ********** on the letter i continued it means nothing it was a *********** act of mine i assure you lieutenant h knew nothing about the letter or that it was in my possession the lieutenant turned very pale for it suddenly occurred to him that he had in his pocket a little ******* which i had asked him to carry for me he immediately drew it out and threw it upon the table when to his ************* and to the surprise of the colonel it was found to be ********* with the very ********* words kindness of lieutenant h which had already excited the ********** of the federal

******** that it was some yankee who was ******* to gain evidence against me but ******** at last yielded to my ******* delight at this really ******** way of ************* with an unknown who ***** he was my friend and i decided on ******** it was an easy thing for me to ******* an *********** ball without ********** myself to the least ********* and by this means i commenced a correspondence which i lead no reason to regret for ******* the ********** ********* may have been he was without doubt ********** and ******* in his *********** of sympathy through him i became possessed of much

heard the **** of the ******** as it struck the ******* or wall of my room before the ******** had time to ****** his piece i would go to the window and look out ********* as *********** as though nothing had occurred to ******* my ********** just after this ******* of the *********** correspondence a green spot in my memory to which i ****** with pleasure i was taken *********** ill with
