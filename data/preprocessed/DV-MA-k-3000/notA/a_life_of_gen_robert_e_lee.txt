with the coming of spring it was ********* the intention of the federal authorities to again ***** the crossing of the rappahannock at some point either above or below fredericksburg and as the

******** of an adversary is dangerous and pride goes before a fall the truth of these ***** ****** was now about to be shown general lee it is said shared the general confidence of his troops and was

general meade it seems scarcely expected to be attacked he anticipated a movement on lees part over the ********** road ********* by giving that direction to his army general lee would have forced his

than the accomplished ****** of stuart hurried across the rapidan with the intelligence stuart whose headquarters were in a ****** of the hills near orange and not far from general lees promptly ************ in person to the commanderinchief this important information and lee ********** immediately an order to general ** hill in rear to march at once and form a junction with ewell in the

behind the small stream called mine run in following with a critical eye the operations of general lee the military ******* must be struck particularly by one ************ that in all his movements he seemed to proceed less according to the nice ************** of the art of war than in ********** with the ******** of a broad and ************* good sense it may be said that in ******** position he always ***** the right and never the wrong one and the choice of mine run now as a defensive line was a proof of this the run is a small *********** which rising south of the great ******* between orange and chancellorsville ***** due ********* amid woods and between hills to the rapidan into which it ******* itself a few miles above ******** general meades main place of crossing this stream is the natural defence of the right flank of an army posted between orange and the rapidan it is also the natural and ******* line upon which to receive the attack of a force marching from below toward ************ behind mine run therefore just east of the little village of ************ general lee directed his two corps to *********** and at the word the men ******** but now ********** in ************** ****** to arms fell in and with ********* ******* took up the line of march we have spoken of the ********** with which the movement was made and it may almost be said that general

a ***** soldier they ********* stuart walking back with general lee and receiving his orders he then promptly mounted and hastened to the front where taking command of his cavalry he formed it in

continued to *********** and feel them along the entire front fighting *********** and falling back only when compelled to do so every step was thus ********* with sharpshooters and the ************** from far below to above ******* church the federal infantry however continued steadily to press forward ******* back the cavalry and on the ##** general meade was in face of mine run lee was ready hill had promptly marched and his corps was coming into position on the right of ewell receiving intelligence of the enemys movement only upon the ********* day lee had seemed to move the divisions of

******** may seem ******* to the general reader but all that *********** the military ******* or ******* the good *********** of lee is worthy of record we proceed now to the narrative in the

his ************* had now gathered around him and one of them said what will history say of our ************ if there is any possibility of escape ********* will not understand it to these words general lee replied yes yes they will not understand our situation but that is not the question the question is whether it is right and if it is right i take the responsibility his expression of
