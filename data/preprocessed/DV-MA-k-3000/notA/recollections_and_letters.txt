that he had to do and ******* that his rations were not sufficient to enable him to ******* the ******* he said however that if it was absolutely necessary to put him on such short ********* he would make the best of it but that he and his comrades wanted to know if general lee was aware that his men were getting so little to eat because if he was aware of it he was sure there must be some necessity for it general lee did not reply directly to the letter but issued a general order in which he informed the soldiers of his efforts in their behalf and that their ********* was beyond his

later i had been assigned to duty with general fitz lee and was with him at this time my mother was anxious that i should be with my father thinking i have no doubt that my continued presence would be

********* useful in various ways but i am opposed to officers *********** themselves with their sons and relatives it is wrong in principle and in that case ********** would be made from private and

their horses ******* their men and ********** their regiments there are too many lees on the committee i like all to be present at the battles but can excuse them at ***** but the saying is children

after ******* attack failed a flag of ***** was sent out and about eleven oclock general lee went to meet general grant the terms of surrender were agreed upon and then general lee called attention to

his ***** cheeks bade ***** to the army in a few words men we have fought through the war together i have done my best for you my heart is too full to say more he bade them goodbye and told them to

mr davis received the first official communication from general lee of his surrender colonel john taylor woods his ********** had taken me in to see the president and he and i were standing by him

richmond accompanied by several companions with the servants and horses belonging to our headquarters these i had brought down with me from lynchburg where i had found them after the surrender after two week of marching and resting i arrived in richmond and found my father there in the house on franklin street now the rooms of the virginia ********** society and also my mother brother and sisters

on only one subject would he take at any length about his own conduct and that was with reference to the ********* of the federal prisoners who had fallen into his hands he seemed to feel deeply the ********** ****** cast upon him by his having been ******** by name in the first ********** ****** against **** though he was afterward ******* from the new charges he explained to me the circumstances under which he had arranged with mcclellan for the exchange of prisoners how he had after the battles of manassas fredericksburg and i think chancellorsville sent all the wounded over to the enemy on the engagement of their generals to ****** them he also told me that on several occasions his ********** generals had come to him after a battle and represented that he had not rations enough both for prisoners and the army when the former had to be sent several days march to their place of *********** and he had always given orders that the wants of the prisoners should be first attended to as from their position they could not save themselves from ********** by ******** or otherwise as the army could when in ******* for provisions the general also explained how every effort had always been made by the confederates to do away with the necessity of ********* prisoners by offering every ******** for exchange till at last when all exchange was refused they found themselves with ##### prisoners for whom they were quite unable to do as much as they wished in the way of food he stated *********** that many of their ********* arose from the necessity of constantly ******** the ******* to prevent ********* with the ********** of the ******* he assured me he had no more to do than i had and did not even know that **** was in charge of ************* prison at least i think he asserted this till after the war was over i could quite ********** with him in his feeling of pain under which his generous nature evidently suffered that the authorities at washington should have ******** him and others ********* ************* in this charge of ******* at the time that letters written by himself general lee taken in richmond when captured *********** that the troops in his army had actually been for days together on several occasions without an ***** of **** were in possession of the military authorities when ********** the state of feeling in england with regard to the war he assured me that it had all along given him the greatest pleasure to feel that the southern cause had the ********** of so many in the old country to which he looked as a second home but in answer to my questions he replied that he had never expected us to give them material aid and added that he thought all *********** were right in ******** only the interests of their own people and in not going to war for an idea when they had no ******** cause of ******* on the subject of slavery he assured me that he had always been in ****** of the ************ of the negroes and that in virginia the feeling had been ******** ********* in the same direction till the ********* enthusiasm ********** to ******* of the ************* in the north had turned the southern **** of feeling in the other direction in virginia about thirty years ago an ********* for the ************ of the slaves had been ******** by only a small majority and every one fully expected at the next convention it would have been carried but for the above cause he went on to say that there was scarcely a ********* new who was not glad that the subject had been ********** settled though nearly all ********* that they had not been wise enough to do it themselves the first year of the war ******** was made by him to a conversation he had with a distinguished ********** of mine he had been visiting a large slave plantation ******* on the james river the ********** had told him that the working ********** were better ***** for there than in any country he had ever visited but that he must never expect an ******** of the institution of slavery by england or aid from her in any cause in which that question was ******** taking these facts and the ********* ********* of the mass of the english to the institution in consideration he said he had never expected help from england the people at the south as the expression is in the main though scarcely *********** seem to hold much the same language as general lee with reference to our ********** and to be much less bitter than *********** ************ i must confess in my own opinion have much less cause to ******** of our ************** of the laws of ********** than the south i may mention here by way of *********** that i was on two separate occasions one in washington and once in lexington told that there were many people in the country who wished that general washington had never lived and that they were still subjects of queen ******** but i should certainly say as a rule the ********* are much too well satisfied with themselves for this feeling to be at all common general lee in the course of this to me most interesting ******** ****** gave me many details of the war too long to put on paper but with reference to the small result of their numerous ********* ********* for it in this way the force which the confederates brought to bear was so often ******** in numbers to that of the yankees that the more they followed up the victory against one portion of the enemys line the more did they lay themselves open to being surrounded by the remainder of the enemy he ******* the ********* to a man ********* a wave of the sea who as rapidly as he ****** a way before him is ********* by the very water he has ********* he spoke of the final surrender as ********** ***** to the *********** in numbers of the enemy his own army had during the last few weeks suffered ********** from ********* in its ranks and *********** by ******** and worn out by ********* had at the time of the surrender only #### men under arms and this

was not surprised to hear him say that he thought it cruel to ******* it in two other battles he named sharpsburg and chancellorsville i think he said the confederates were to the federals in point of numbers as ##### to ###### and ##### to ###### ************ so that the mere ********* of numbers was not sufficient to ******** him of the necessity of surrender but feeling that his own army was ********* of the ******** ************ of the contest as ********* by their ********* he took the course of ************ his army in **** of ********* it for utter ************ turning to the
