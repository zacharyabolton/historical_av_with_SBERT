several weeks ago i wrote quite a long letter from ******* *** ********* to a very dear little girl and told her that a certain soldier who ***** one of her long ****** ******** next his heart was ******** bound and that he hoped a line of welcome would meet him on his arrival in his native state he told her of the difficulties he had *********** in being relieved from his post of how sorry he was to ******* the sword which had helped to bring victory to the country for which he had fought and how sorry he was to say ****** to his little command and to part from his faithful and ******* companion his dog and his many dear friends but ******* still for the existing circumstances which made this ********* necessary he told her many things for which with him she will be sorry and some of which he hopes will make her glad he is troubled by finding no answer to this long letter which having at that time no ****** of the real conditions here he is afraid was written too freely by far no my child i had no ********** of the ********* of feeling the bitterness and ****** toward those who were so ****** our friends and are now our enemies i of course have always *********** opposed ******** not as ******** the right of secession which was taught in our ******** at west point but as ******* *********** its ********** i believed that the ************* spirit which ******** both north and south was but a passing ***** of ********** which would ****** under the ****** of all good citizens who would surely unite in ********* the constitution but when that great ******** composed of ********* ******* ****** *********** ********* ****** white ****** men of thought met in south carolina and when their ********* were called crept *********** to the table in the ****** of the room and ******* their ********** to the ********* on which the ********* of secession was ********* and when in ******* silence spite of the gathered ********* general ******* arose and without

next day we left for ****** by the ******** train thence we made our ******** way back south again ****** ******** arrest several times and finally arrived in dear old richmond september 13th just four days ago i at once ******** in the army and the following day was ************ captain but so bitter is the feeling here that my being *********** delayed so long in ******* my allegiance to my

the ***** ground as i wrote you last followed the next day by one of fire and blood the battle of seven pines i pray that you accepted the invitation of your mountain **** and that your beautiful eyes

fought as ********** should fighting as they did for the right for love honor home and state principles which they had been taught from the mothers knees the ********** and the ****** under orders from old ***** we marched at daylight and reported to d h hill near seven pines hill directed me to ride over and *********** with hood i started at once with ******* and ****** of my staff to obey

fear and haste the man dropped his ******* and ******* his ******* threatened to kill me unless i ******** him at once saying that the yankees were upon his ***** we ******** back to hills headquarters ****** bringing up the rear with the ****** who explained that the enemy were advancing in force and were within a few hundred yards of us hill ordered me to attack at once which i did driving them through an ****** over a ********* leading to the railroad as we were ******* the second ****** i on foot at the time noticed that ********** brigade had broken and sent a ******* back ********* to hill for troops a second and third message were sent and then a fourth telling him that if he would send me more troops and ammunition we could drive the enemy across the chickahominy but alas hill as brave as great as heroic a soldier as he is has since the fall of johnston been so ******** and ******* with ************** orders that he was if i may say so ******** and failed to

***** ******* it was a ****** battery hidden in the ****** it is ********* to the enemy and easily ******* from one ****** place to the other it used to be the only way in which shells could be thrown it ****** these shells high in the air and they fall by their own weight without the least warning of their coming there is no ********* or ********* sound like that made by our modern shells they

that are doing the ******* butler with promise of ***** pay for ***** work and ***** danger has induced four hundred of the colored soldiers to ********* to ******* their ****** and take up the ****** and go to ******* the bank to be cut through is only about five feet at the highest point the ***** is to be where the james makes a great **** just above ***** gap ********* a point of land perhaps half a mile wide and about three miles in length and which at the neck is only five hundred yards across from river to river their ***** would thus save them six miles and would allow their gunboats

search of an exposed water ******* it is strange that some of our brilliant ********* ****** made this near cut years ago as for me i should ********* butler and his river *********** company and ***** throwing these ******** shells whose silent fall ******* a sudden roar of ********* that ******* terror to my soul the ***** will be an advantage to us and butler in ******* it for us may in

********** ********* with ***** and ****** and then with gold and notes she had tried without ******* ***** ******* her intention to offer her *********** to remain but had failed mrs davis said she
