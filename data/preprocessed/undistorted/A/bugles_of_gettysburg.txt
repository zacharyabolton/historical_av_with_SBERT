the morning come back to me radiant with faith and hope and love even though darkened sometimes by clouds of war from the memory fabric made of all those golden dreams that center around my first soldier i take the threads to weave this little story of olden days lovingly dedicated to his namesake son major george e pickett us army my last soldier whose life linked those vivid days with the present and who came home across the sea from the faroff philippines with eyes closed to earth to be forever opened to the light of eternal day half a century has passed since the bugles of gettysburg first echoed from height to height over hill and valley the thunder of the red artillery the rush of the charging cavalry the tread of the advancing infantry reverberating with unremitting roll of musketry over the field furrowed and torn by shot and shell watered and stained by the lifeblood of friend and foe alike today the bugles of gettysburg are heard again not by armed men with surging passions putting a question of empire to the arbitrament of the sword but a quiet throng with the gentlest phases of their nature awakened to sad and awesome memories of those battle days in which a nation was saved and a nation was lost three persons are standing in the valley looking in awed silence at seminary ridge and across the sunlit space to the range opposite as if the long ranks of men who passed over that ground fifty years ago were before their eyes and they heard the crash of the guns that made deadly gaps in the line one of them is an old man whitehaired and stooped with a step that has lost its youthful alertness he is in the darkening shadows of lifes dimming twilight and yet as he wanders over the historic field the bugles of the past echo in his heart and his pulses bound again with the fervor of youth the winds of battle sweep around him as he follows the flag up that flamecrested height to the mouth of the blazing guns beside him is a gentlefaced woman with a wealth of gray hair in soft waves around her face and dark eyes that hold sad memories of one who lost his life there her gaze is lifted above the old line of march seeking visions beyond the mountains an officer in the blue uniform of the united states army looks down at her with filial love i was thinking my son of him whose name you bear my cousin garnett she said in a tone that dwelt lingeringly upon the name she loved the colonel pressed her hand tenderly he was one of the first to answer president mckinleys call for volunteers side by side with his father who confederate veteran as he was had volunteered with him and donned the federal blue at his countrys need he served through the spanish war and was commissioned in the regular army now he heard wonderingly the echo of the bugle notes of those olden days and looked hopefully into the future dreaming that it might hold for him the glory even though it threw over him the gloom of those famecrowned hills reminiscences of the day that seemed to belong to a lost age came surging back to the older man here garnett my son is where we marched through the fires of destruction up yes up to the very gates of hell it was terrible terrible magnificent but not war no not war not war the woman clung shudderingly to his arm and looked up into his face whispering and where where over there i think my dear over there he replied in a tone dropped low in tenderness gazing toward the outer edge of the field yes somewhere over there my son is the grave of my comrade to whom i owe life and you and all that is good how much the old heartsome word comrade means aylett as you say it today murmured the woman the younger man stood silent looking questioningly at them both and then across the field marveling over the vision his father called up of half a century gone yes my son the god of battles who holds the universe in the hollow of his hand knew that the safety of the union was the safety of the states and he willed that they should be brought back each for each the echoes of the bugles of gettysburg will forever carry around the world the fame of lee and of meade of longstreet and pickett and hancock hill pettigrew birney slocum kemper and trimble they tell us anew of the daring deeds of the philadelphia brigade they sound taps over the unknown grave of garnett sleeping where he fell they sound a pean for fauquiers son armistead and echo his last words as with cap on sword he led his brigade up to the federal guns calling out remember boys remember follow me strike for your homes your wives and your sweethearts come follow me they thrill with memories of the brave men of his brigade of his colonels hodges magruder edwards griggs all of whom were killed and of his lieutenantcolonels phillips white aylett all wounded of colonel charles pey ton the leader of the gamecock regiment going into battle with the one arm left to him from an early battle of williams mayo patton and otey yes the bugles will ever tell of dearing and caskie of clopton and cushing and stribling and cowan and the many who bore well their part here in those fiery days to meet no more till they had passed into the mystic land with those names that are emblazoned upon the page of history go the spirit and the force and the courage of the thousands of nameless heroes who reached the last great height of sacrifice and left the memory of the private soldier as a priceless legacy to their country the bugles of gettysburg bear a message of peace today the peace which the battle foreshadowed and to which it led a soft sweet echo of those buglenotes has swept over the old battlefield and thrilled the hearts of onetime foes who have become friends it has been the accompaniment of the grandest melody ever sung the harmony of friendship and love into which the years have merged the mournful sounds of that field of darkness and blood the bugles have echoed in sweetest tones overhands that are clasped across a sea of tears all the more warmly because of the distance and the darkness over which they have met they played softly around the scene when the sword of an unknown hero who fell on the slope of cemetery ridge was returned upon that field by colonel cowan of cushings battery who had kept it through many years vainly seeking some one with title to receive that sacred weapon dropped from the brave hand that bore it with honor unto death they rang out in thrilling music when the sword of armistead was returned to picketts men beside the scroll which marks the spot where it fell from the hand that had borne it through fire and blood to the remotest limit of the high tide at gettysburg and which fell nerveless when that tide receded above the plain over the range of hills and around the desolate peaks of the round tops that keep solemn guard over the ground on which the greatest chapter of our history was written the echoes of the bugles of gettysburg yet thrill with quivering memories of the days that consecrated those hills to immortality and to the three who stand there together hand clasped in hand eyes dimmed with tears this is the story the bugles tell he latest news is that virginia has seceded yes i wonder what the captain will do the young lieutenant sitting just within the door raised his head as the speakers passed the lines of his mouth drew tense and his brown eyes deepened almost to black whatever the captain may do there is only one thing the lieutenant can do he said to himself grimly only one thing and it is like letting out the hearts blood to do it the one thing that the lieutenant could do must be done at once the first mail east must carry his resignation to the war department but at what cost at what terrific cost he sat long in the dusk gazing out upon the flag floating proudly from its staff the waving of its red white and blue folds thrilled him as in the olden times he could not recall a day when that banner had not been to him a sacred thing there came memories of boyhood days in his home city when he watched it fluttering in the wind borne at the head of a long line of veterans of 1812 celebrating the triumphs they had won in their hotblooded youth he remembered the ambition that filled his heart as he thought that some day he too would be one of a long blue line to celebrate hardwon battles the old time at west point its hardships and ambitions its work and fun its boyish dreams they all came back now that the old life was done and over them all the old flag had waved before his hearts vision waved another flag deep blue bearing the legend sic semper tyrannis the motto of virginia mother of states mother of presidents and nearer and dearer to him mother of his home and of all most loved by him over mountain and plain across desert and forest came that loved and loving voice come back to virginia come home come home come back to virginia he would answer the call through all the long and weary miles that lay between the pacific coast and the dear old state that called him what would she think catherine marshall his promised wife surely she would know that it had taken the news long to reach him surely she must realize that the return home would require many weeks yet she might wait and wonder and marvel over his delay when virginia called him would she doubt and the captain his beloved captain elbows on knees he sunk his head in his hands how could he meet the reproach which would look out of those tigergray eyes when he announced his determination to resign from the service under the flag they had both loved so well and suppose it were more than reproach suppose his superior officer unswerving in his devotion to duty should consider him a traitor should forbid his leaving the post should place him under arrest he rose stiffly with white lips and set jaw he would go at once before his courage failed he found captain pickett arrayed for a dinner at governor tiltons a handsome figure in his fulldress uniform erect as a young pine alert as a panther his tigerlike eyes gray with glints of blue in sunny moods glittering like steel when he led his men to battle darkening in moments of deep emotion now flashed out skyey tints as he smiled a welcome perhaps captain you may guess the errand on which i have come you have of course heard the news of virginia that she has seceded yes he spoke in the low tone that had been called a velvet casing around a charge of dynamite there was a pause jasper carrington shifted his hat uneasily painfully conscious that he was behaving like a schoolboy he nerved himself to the effort it was momentous news to me he said i have been battling with myself for hours he paused again perhaps the captain would say something would ask a question but the captain was waiting with official courtesy for the younger man to tell his story i have loved the flag the union so well jaspers voice was not quite steady i had thought that they would always be as dear even dearer as the years went by and now this comes and changes things so 1 seem to love my country as much or moregod only knows how it hurts to have to choose but virginia the state that gave me birth and my father and grandfather before me she needs me she calls me he took a step forward as if he saw a vision his voice broke and sank almost to a whisper she calls me and i cannot choose but go he stepped back and steadied himself against a chair forgive me captain he bowed i beg your pardon be seated lieutenant there was no change in the level tone but the captains face was white be seated please and after a moment have you anything further to say only this captain pickett i should like to add that as it has been no small part of my happiness in the army to be under your command so the leaving of that command is no small part of my unhappiness in withdrawing from the army i have been proud very proud of my captain i am sorry more than sorry to go again he bowed with military formality and now i must not detain you longer i should not have come at such an hour he awaited permission to retire but it did not come there is no haste lieutenant there is still time before dinner the captain spoke absently and toyed with an indian knife lying on his desk for use as a papercutter then he rose and began to pace back and forth in the restricted space between the walls you know of course lieutenant that i also am a virginian yes captain did you suppose did you think that i should not be tempted that it would be no struggle for me to remain with the flag we have served together so long his head was bent and jasper could not see his face i could not judge for any but myself captain he said at length in other circumstances i should have come to you and consulted you and been guided by the course you took buti have a mother and sister in virginia they and the old home must be guarded andi have a sweetheart the woman who is to be my wife has no brother to fight for her there are many reasons why i should return when my state calls me captain pickett still pacing slowly back and forth hands behind him paused before the lieutenant and raised his head lieutenant carrington he said i too have battled with myself have felt my heartstrings strained to breaking point as i thought of the old flag have heard virginia calling calling he put his two hands on the lieutenants shoulders and i too cannot choose but go they stood thus gazing into one anothers eyes then lieutenant carringtons fell bravo my captain he whispered the captain turned slowly to his desk and laid his hands heavily on a large official envelope i sealed this a few moments before you came he said in a low tone it contains my resignation from the united states army god forgive me but it must be so he held out his hand and the two soldiers who had sacrificed so much clasped hands now said the captain we are no longer officers of the united states army we are soldiers of virginia with no formalities of rank between us one in devotion to her service after the lieutenant had gone the captain stood long in sad meditation not like one who hesitates but as a man who takes leave of all his past life he thought of the man who had first made the aspiration of his youth the realization of his manhood a heavy sadness came with the memory how that dear old friend now the head of the nation the man at the wheel of the ship of state would grieve when he knew that at the parting of the ways his cadet had taken the opposite road he recalled his first experience of the realities of war the war with mexico which had first shaken his youthful conviction that his country could not even by a hairsbreadth be anything but right the memory of those early days of battle returned through the years the wearisome march over sunbaked roads under tropical skies the rush up embattled heights to flaming summits then came the campaigns of the windswept plains the sharp swift conflict the triumph and thenthe part that he loved the uplifting of the conquered to a higher life a knowledge of the ways of peace of something better than ghost dances and the slaying of enemies whatever might come to him in after life he should remember with joy that he had brought some of the light of knowledge into the lives of the children of the plains and the flag waved over it all always the flag always its blue sky with the fixed stars shining down and its red and white folds waving in the breeze always the flag beckoning leading on to victory always the flag the flag he winds were whirling the dust of san francisco into the face of a man who had just landed from a southbound steamer and was walking up clay street from the rickety old wharf his hat was pulled low upon his forehead his gray tigereyes almost hidden by its brim he was opposing a strong front against the wind like one used to battle so absorbed was he in the conflict and so blinded by the dust that he did not see a fellow sufferer coming in the opposite direction until made aware of him by a sudden impact which thrust them both into the friendly shelter of an overarching entrance where they looked at each other breathlessly carrington cried he of the tigereyes ts it possible how very remarkable after missing our rendezvous they clasped hands in a way that signified not only oldtime friendship but a newborn tie so strong that it needed not words to attest its fidelity it is indeed remarkable captain ive been wondering how on earth we should find each other yes i wasnt able to leave the post five days after you as i planned and through that i missed a boat ive only just got in i was going to hunt for you but had no idea where to begin the wind swept around the corner and scudded off with the captains hat which his companion caught and restored to its owner then with a start of surprise he said it is you captain all right but narcissus without his tresses apollo without his lute laughingly he went on what on earth did you do it for how did it happen i didnt do it for it was an accident an accident you dont say so yes just before i left the post i went into the shop to have my hair trimmed as usual and it seems the barber was a new man he says he asked me about it and i said yes or murmured something he took to be yes i was naturally very much absorbed in thought and perhaps i did anyway i noticed nothing till my locks lay on the floor but ive realized since that it was a good thing perhaps it wouldnt be safe for me to be standing talking to you here otherwise i suppose not and we must get away as soon as possible but dont worry captain your own mother wouldnt recognize you when youre not speaking i knew your voice but if i had seen you before you spoke i never in the world should have suspected that it was you this blustering wind has its compensations then it has saved us our search for one another but you carrington oh im safe enough as you see im roughing it and nobody but a faithful friend with eyes and heart like yours would know me come lets go over to peter jobs peter jobs that sounds rather too apostolic and redundant of virtue for a pair of rough soldiers it is appetizing and redundant of hospitality at any rate and we can get a spread and a bottle of good heidsieck and lave our souls in golden memories before the overshadowing events become too heavy to be forgotten into the driving wind they went again crossing to washington street and passing the opera house to peter jobs where they secured a table in an alcove hidden by a curtain it was the leisure time between luncheon and dinner and most of the tables were deserted later two men in the uniform of the united states army came in and took seats at a table near them looking carefully around the room and afterward bending their heads together over a piece of paper medium size good build graceful form long curling brown hair gray eyes with shades of blue fair complexion picturesque appearance one of them drawled after draining his third glass hair is always uncertain it might be cut eyes ought to have a permanent significance but if sometimes blue and sometimes gray how the dickens can you tell fair complexion all right unless he paints picturesque probably he does carrington hidden behind the curtain exchanged glances with his companion and anxiously waited till their neighbors were gone as they went down the street they saw the two officers opposite at the corner the captain and jasper turned down a cross street the blueuniformed men followed as if they too might have been incidentally going in that direction when they reached the next corner the virginians turned again and looked the officers still followed them at the next turning were two men fighting a group of street idlers blocking the way skilfully eluding the pack the captain and jasper had the satisfaction on looking back of seeing the unknown officers caught in the mob and jostled to the pavement while the victims were extricating themselves jasper drew his companion down a flight of steps into a subterranean apartment the room was empty and jasper hurried through it holding the captain by the hand they passed through the door on the opposite side and came into the open street where they called a hack giving an order to the driver they speeded up the street they did not see a dark man of sinister aspect who looked in vain for another vehicle and went his way cursing neatly done said the captain that comes of knowing your san francisco i am taking you to my quarters when you reflect upon the importance of quiet you will understand that they cannot be of a magnificent description but they will give us a safe shelter tomorrow the uncle sam will set sail for new york and two vagabonds very much unknown will be among the passengers see i shall reverse the name of our host of this afternoon and become job peters a shipwrecked sailor and you you shall be a wandering troubadour from provence and from the twelfth century you look enough like it and your guitar will come in place what name shall you take they talked and planned far into the night but were up betimes and went early aboard the uncle sam they stood together and watched the varied throngs come up the gangplank jasper made jesting remarks in an undertone though captain pickett warned him that their conversation must be limited and of the most commonplace character yon cassius hath a lean and hungry look whispered jasper as a tall spare man his slouch hat low over his eyes and his chin sunk in his collar passed them with a keen glance a few feet away the man turned and again looked at them but captain pickett clever in his part of alien stared vacantly at him and he went on the ship weighed anchor and the long weary voyage began she was barely out of sight of land before it began to be whispered about that two of her passengers were of unusual interest even in that motley crowd one was job peters a sailor whose graphic yarns enlightened the tedium of the monotonous voyage the other was arnaut jasmin from south europe a slender graceful man having but slight acquaintance with the english language he would listen to the stories of his sailor companion now with interest and again with bewilderment as a confusion of new words would interrupt the thread of the narrative when alone he would take his guitar and sing a sprightly lyric of france or a spanish serenade playing an accompaniment as he sang a group of music lovers would gather round him in moods responsive to the gaiety of his barcarolles or the melancholy of his love songs lieutenant have you an enemy the two virginians stood in a remote part of the boat and trusted themselves to speak naturally i hope so captain i should not like to be so characterless as not to have one but an inveterate enemy i mean one who pursues you relentlessly as a supreme object in life like the villain in the play on the track of the noble hero i have never posed as a noble hero sufficiently to know possibly if i should ever distinguish myself in that way such a personality might develop it would be necessary as the play could scarcely go on without him i am in dead earnest jasper sporam 4h and this may be a tragedy for you i am trying to warn you dont do it not that i am ungrateful but you know what the philosophic arabs say on two days it steads not to run from thy grave on the appointed and the unappointed day on the first neither balm nor physician can save nor thee on the second the universe slay but what on earth has put it into your head just now that i have what did you call him an inveterate enemy you do not fancy that something is about to happen tome do you what shadow do you see upon the deck it is worse than a shadow it is a persistent and vindictive looking substance that has caused me anxiety for some days the spare man with a dark gloomy sinister determined face yon cassius in a word why i never saw the fellow before nor i but he watches you most malevolently he may be mad but i dont like it and if i were you id be on the alert when hes around it must be then captain that there is some one on board who does not like me i am grateful to him you warn me of him i am even more grateful to you he seems to be one of our own countrymen strange to say he speaks most unmistakably the mothertongue of the blessed state to which we are bound i cant think who he is unless it is that hound campo they call him the raven because he is dark and gloomy and prophetic of evil but i beg the ravens pardon this raven is more than that he is thoroughly unprincipled and desperate i myself dont know him but have been told that he regards me with especial malevolence because he is jealous the puppy has the presumption and impudence to imagine himself in love with one whose heart is in my keeping ah that sounds reasonable though not the less detestable but stay some one is coming and the captain strummed gently on his guitar and turned a melancholy gaze seaward hen the uncle sam weighed anchor in new york harbor two of her passengers were standing a little apart from the others silent amid the commotion of arrival but watching narrowly all that occurred and listening with quiet attention to the conversation that went on around them their anxiety hidden by an air of casual interest the dark man they called cassius stood near them when the pilot came on board the captain of the ship with the eagerness of one who has had no word from shore for weeks called out whats the news its a black squall here was the reply and it veers northard and southard till a man doesnt know which way hes sailing whats the particular blow today arrests for treason and all that one man just brought here in a boat in irons lets see whats his name hes a comdore comdore barron yes thats it job peters started like one who had received a sudden shock and his friend impulsively moved toward him as if to defend him from a blow the dark man smiled grimly i cant help feeling that its kind o queer to think of americans being brought to for that sort o thing and one with the comdoreslogbook too the ships captain spoke irritably but im not saying anything except its a time when it pays a man to keep his sails close reefed and hug the shore the two quiet travelers had no baggage to detain them he of the troubadour guise having left all papers and valuables in the care of the british officers who had occupied san juan with him and jasper having abandoned in san francisco everything that could have betrayed him they left the ship separately meeting a half hour later at a designated point above the wharf from which they walked on along the waters edge where are we going jasper new york ought to be big enough to afford us a haven of safety somewhere yes but well have to be careful where we sail there are plenty of sand bars on which to wreck our craft and whirlpools enough to sink us to the depths i see you think we are adrift upon an unknown sea almost captain though i do know one harbor alongshore it is kept by an old sea captain who is laid up now but never gets faraway from the ocean he must be where he can hear it roll and see it toss up its waves to the sun he would be lonesome without that so he stays down here in a place called sailors rest he says because sailors have never been known to rest there he is out of politics has never been in says he found the water treacherous enough for him the silent man knew that his friend was talking against time talking against thought talking against feeling he took his hand and gently spoke his name the two went on in silence until they reached sailors rest where they were received by a bluff old seaman rollicking and jolly with a walk like the rolling of the waves jasper carrington manys the storm your uncle the commodore and i have weathered together and manys the voyage weve taken over waves that rocked as gently as a cradle jasper introduced his companion and the sailor went on youre both as welcome as a sunshiny morning after a squally night and you captain pickett i am as glad to see you as if you had trod the quarterdeck with us he led the way upstairs with voluminous expressions of delight when they were in his loft he shut the door and turned to jasper with a serious look i know about uncle said jasper i heard it as i landed you mustnt cast anchor here very long theres nothing you can do and youd only make things worse by getting scuttled yourself he has shipmates here and theyll do everything that can be done to get him into safe water again i know you will do all that is possible ill set your sails for a safe harbor where you can look around a bit and get your bearings of course they cant do anything to the comdore moren to keep him in the hold awhile i thought sailors rest was as good a harbor as could be found said jasper it looks like it but loyal as i am and quiet as i am they have an eye on my place for some reason a commotion below called the old sailor away and his guests heard him saying on with your serious mug and doctors coat shipmate he went on down the stairs and his voice came back to them in greeting to apparently unwelcome visitors officers is it you want you wont find em here what do you think i want o shooting irons and cutting things around sailors rest this is a peaceful harbor for unseaworthy craft to sail into and put up for repairs you wont find anything here but boats gone to wreck and seadogs on their last legs i suppose you will let us look around over your upper deck will you not this young man was on the boat with them and heard them arranging to come here theres no one come yet but go right ahead no wait better ask old pillbox first theres a sick man up there steering straight for tother world with a gospel pilot towing him in and you might have to step in quiet here comes the medical mate these gentlemen want to go up doc they cant unless they want to have murder on their souls after a moments consultation they decided to give the sick man his one chance and departed the sailor returned to his guests i made them believe old saltwater jake was a lifebuoy and he doesnt know a pill from a pulpit but its getting rough weather here for you theres a squall coming up from the north and youd better up sail and scud before the wind to a safer port none of your ports up this way seem to be very safe replied jasper well you might have struck a peacefuler landing than this but theres a gospel tug up in the city hooked to a ship of zion away up among the high swells thatll tow you along into smoother sailing and land you on to ashore where the green pastures of peace will lie all around you the gospel tug mentioned by the old sailor was the pastor of a popular church in new york though he was of a northern family brother of a man whoafterward won distinction in the federal army his sympathies went out to the south many a southron fleeing homeward to offer his sword to his country had been protected and helped on his way by the greathearted preacher the two soldiers knew of the minister and his friendship for their cause and gladly followed the suggestion of their friend so often had similar incidents occurred that dr paxton was not surprised that morning to receive a call from the two who were fleeing from the overwarm hospitality of the otherwise frigid north george pickett and jasper carrington you say good names names that are both dear to me nevertheless i am not sure that i am glad to see you for the atmosphere here is not very healthful for such as you my friends any atmosphere should be healthful where you are doctor ah if it were said the minister i would diffuse it all over the country and restore sanity and good fellowship you are doing useful work as itis in making a haven of restfulness and safety for those who are hastening to the defense of their homes and firesides i do the little that god has given me the power to do but come you have not breakfasted no our late host generous as he 1s had good reason for not insisting upon our company at breakfast then you shall give me that pleasure breakfast is served and i hope we may be allowed to take it in peace but the good man was not permitted to realize his hope they had just taken places at table when the bell sounded and the host excused himself returning he said they have begun early today it is the third time within a week that my house has been thus honored come down this hall and find a hidingplace outside while my faithful butler looks for the doorkey which he has accidentally dropped he guided them through a hallway into a small garden inclosed by a high wall beckoning to two men who were fastening to a lattice a rosevine which had been torn loose by the wind the workmen came promptly forward as if accustomed to such interruptions and put their rough coats and hats upon the newcomers saying quick take our places at the roses and disappeared the officers and their sinisterlooking guide having reached the diningroom in their search looked from the window and saw two men who seemed absorbed in gardening raising the window one of them called have you seen any men going through here this morning no sir said jasper we aint seed nobody he spoke with a nasal twang and fumbled clumsily with his hat the other workman looked on with an expression of curiosity as if but half comprehending what was said returning to the library the officers took an apologetic leave of dr paxton that is all right gentlemen said the doctor these times require strict watchfulness good morning when the unwelcome callers were gone dr paxton invited the volunteer gardeners to return to their breakfast at the close of which he said i hope you will not think it inhospitable if i suggest your going at once it is sometimes far more hospitable to speed the parting guest we thank you doctor with all our hearts for this the truest hospitality but the question is how are we to get away remembering a friend is leaving for canada i have just sent a message to him hastening his departure by a day or two his love for me and loyalty to our cause is unquestioned you will be safe with him go to virginia by way of canada it is a case in which the longest way around is the shortest way home he laughed that evening george pickett and jasper carrington took the train for canada every revolution of the wheels carrying them farther and farther away from the home and friends they were so eager to reach he dim old library at magnolia lawn was very cool and quiet the sun which all day had beaten somewhat too warmly down upon the thick vines and closed shutters now sent his last level rays unhindered through the wide uncurtained windows one of them slipping silently inch by inch at last touched the flowerlike face of a girl sitting in a low chair by the centertable she glanced at the west windows then closed the book which had lain idle on her knee it was useless to try to read she had not turned a page since first sitting down some twenty minutes before she walked slowly to the end of the long room and stood with her hands behind her looking northward she did not see the wide gardens nor the fields beyond she saw hundreds of miles away the northern camp floating proudly above it were the once beloved stars and stripes she saw the long ranks of men in blue and among them preparing to fight perhaps already fighting against his home his friends his brothers was the man she loved dear god could she bear anything so horrible surely her heart must break surely some terrible illness must smite her mercifully to blot out consciousness memory torment why shut up in the library cousin kate ive been looking for you everywhere oh is that you garnett she turned with a wan smile as he crossed the room i thought you were busy ive been trying to read why trying if you are not in the mood oh because it doesnt do to think too much i cant keep my thoughts from those of our boys who havent come home yet hundreds have come you know from all over the country but there were a good many on the pacific coast and nothing has been heard of them there is captain pickett for one it surely cannot be that he would remain with the north and yet where is he no one has heard no one has any idea it seems so terrible not to know doesnt it she was silent for a few moments there are others we know personally lieutenant carrington of brightview the big place over by the gap i dont believe youve ever met him the family inherited the place and came there when you were away his mother and sister are nearly wild some one but an enemy of his sent word that he was seen in new york days ago so he must have come east and his not coming home looks so suspicious can you imagine anything that would detain him that would detain any one after landing there are always delays cousin mine and of course if our men walked out with french leave they may not have been allowed to resign you know if they deserted to put it bluntly they are liable to arrest and what then the words were only a whisper he glanced at her white tense face then closed his big hand over her small one as it hung at her side nothing perhaps he said reassuringly a few days imprisonment or a mere reprimand probably you really think so cousin garnett she looked up at him like an eager child he turned away his head he was not used to lying this cleareyed young soldier surely cousin mine but why waste tender sympathy over neighbors and heroes you have hardly seen when they may not be in need of it and god knows he added solemnly we may all be in dire need of it before many moons have passed how doubly trebly blessed are those of us for whom your special prayers will arise ah kate if i might go into battle tomorrow with a word of more than cousinly affection if you would give me hope hope i will wait for years if it need be i wont bother you if you will only tell me that i carry your love with me when i go can youwill youtell me that you have had my love so long the girls eyes filled with tears garnett dear dear garnett i do love you but not that way please dont be unhappy about it and you make me unhappy too and we should have only sweet tender memories of your last evening before you go out to fight for us you go to fight for the south garnett above all but you have no sister when the other men are thinking of their mothers and sisters if they seem to be fighting for them i shall be proudso proud if you will think of me we have been more to one another than cousins garnett dear you have been to me the brother i have never had and i perhaps to you the sister who died when you were little you may fight for the south and and for me dear cousin she turned to the window where the twilight was deepening her voice sank and each morning and evening wherever i am i shall pray for you that god may bless and keep you and bring you back to us he bent and kissed her two hands reverently it is as god wills he said gently though i may not have your heart i am more than blessed in having your prayers he left the room slowly as if loth to go the girl still stood by the window he was very dear to her this soldier cousin it hurt her to give him pain she wondered vaguely how girls could glory in their conquests when it hurt so much she thought of one man whose wooing had frightened her the only one among many for whom she had felt no pang when she refused him she had since heard that he had sworn vengeance upon jasper what a cowardly what a despicable step to take it was he who had sent word that jasper had returned to the east but remained in the union army she lifted a white face dear god make it not true make it not true from canada our travelers rode southward keeping to trackless wilderness and mountain roads after some days they struck a narrow pass in the cumberland mountains where the range divides the golden fields of old kentucky from the neighboring lands of tennessee a storm had swept down upon the heights and a swirl of strong winds hurled itself wildly over the towering gray ramparts and against the jagged walls of the dark mountainclefts lightnings flashed into the black corridors and thunders reverberated from wall to wall like the crash of guns in a great artillery battle riding through the pass the captain and jasper stopped under a shelving ledge sheltering themselves from the blinding sheets of rain i say captain well this doesnt seem like hospitable kentucky it does not when kentucky was created all the acrid characteristics which might have been scattered through her and injected into the hearts of her people were heaped up along the border line where nobody but outlaws like you and me need ever meet them hospitable kentucky is down there on the level green and gold meadows where the people open houses and hearts to all who come their way jasper looked wistfully down into the valley if the poet expected a cheerful answer to his query what pleasure dwells in heights he could not have addressed it to fugitives lost in mountain thunderstorms i have friends down there in the meadow said the captain this is the time of need when a friend would be a friend indeed a retrospective look overspread the countenance of the captain the homey enchantment of the old place comes back to me now the flavor of the wonderful things emerging from that generous larder appeals to me more strongly than did lucullian banquets to the roman epicure and oh the bottles of kentucky sunshine hidden away in the cellar wound about with spiderwebs of decades and crowned with garlands of vanished years if i ever had a shade of delicacy about accepting unoffered invitations the winds have blown it away lets go they plunged into the valley leaping brooks and fences pounding over rocks and rugged crossroads and skimming lightly down meadow paths the storm followed them blotting out the stars that flamed in the dusks of the deep sky and filling the night with a cannonade entering spacious grounds they cantered up a wide driveway dismounted and struck the old knocker which had hung upon the front door since good old colony times when we lived under the king the door was opened hesitatingly and a face peered out a gleam of light fell upon the travelers and the door was thrown wide open while a genial voice called george pickett i need not tell you how welcome you are they entered the wide hall and the captain introduced his friend the host cordially grasped the lieutenants hand your friend is necessarily on the right side he said as he ushered his visitors into a bright room where they were welcomed by a gentlefaced woman i have been watching for your name on our army list captain said the host and have wondered that you were so long delayed i was half afraid of you when i heard your knock we have had two visits today one from cavalrymen who called us rebels and took off our horses and the other from a detachment of infantry who addressed us as decorated yankees and killed our cows you may understand that the experience has tended to narrow our hospitality to strangers it might have that effect now i shall take you to my room where you will put on what clothes we can find that fit you best and let mammy dilsey dry yours by the kitchen fire after that you are to have an old kentucky supper such as you have not seen for years pomp bring out the golden particular nothing else will do for an occasion like this yas suh said pomp from somewhere in the shadows if the pleasant home environment and the lulling influence of the kentucky supper led the travelers to anticipations of a restful night they were doomed to disappointment as they had not jogged far into slumberland when they were awakened by a vigorous clutch they have come said the kentuckian and they outnumber us no let your pistols alone you cant afford a fight when you dont know which side the first shot may bring down on you come the visitors followed him into an unfinished room with unplastered walls and ceiling up among the joists they swung themselves up and peering down between waited soon afterward footsteps entered the room they had left and came toward their hidingplace the door opened and pomp appeared upon the threshold carrying alighted candle two officers following him as the sable guide stepped across the entrance he stumbled and the candle fell from his hand ef dat canle ain done gone en unlit it se f grumbled old pomp from the darkness that followed the accident jes wait mar sers en ill git a match the matches were hard to find and some minutes elapsed before pomp announced exultantly hyear dey is now well hab a light there followed a succession of unavailing efforts to strike a light and pomps disappointed voice growled after another series of labored efforts he succeeded in lighting his candle and started toward the door where the officers waited the clatter of galloping horses was heard coming nearer and nearer and then the cry sambo bursting into the room that was feebly lit by pomps struggling candle the two officers rushed out of the room joined their companions who had waited below and their horses were heard clattering away in the distance the captain and sam leaped from the joists where are morgans men i am sorry your rest was disturbed said their host its the fortunes of war replied the captain next morning the riders were early in the saddle and on a sunny september day the beautiful fields of virginia spread out before them barely touched as yet by the fires of war they circled the federal lines and on the 12th of september 1861 they rode into the queen city of the confederacy into the heart of the storm they did not separate until they had been together to the military headquarters and enlisted in the army of the confederacy then jasper at once started for home stopping at magnolia lawn as he passed it was dusk when he dismounted at the steps and threw the reins to a young negro the front door stood hospitably wide in the warmth of the early evening as he crossed the porch a little figure came running down the long hall and flung itself into his outstretched arms oh jasper you have come thank god you have come i was so afraid they said that you but you are here my love you are here she lay sobbing brokenly in his arms nothing matters nothing matters you are heresitting by the roadside on a summer day chatting with my messmates passing time away lying in the shadow underneath the trees goodness how delicious eating goober peas he notes of the old song rang out in a fine baritone and wove their way like a silver thread in and out among the leafy branches of a cluster of trees where a group of soldiers were resting after a toilsome march regaling themselves with the delicacy celebrated in their song the fruits of a foraging expedition against a neighboring farm where the remains of last years crop were stored a chorus of voices tenor bass and nondescript joined lieutenantcolonel jasper carrington in the refrain peas peas peas peas eating goober peas goodness how delicious eating goober peas they fell to with renewed relish as the echo of their song rolled from tree to tree and out over the river jasper finished his repast and lay looking sentimentally through the foliage of the great oak that spread its branches over him singing with plaintive softness peas peas peas to a gray squirrel peering at him from the crotch of the tree it scampered off to a very high limb from which it plucked an acorn and nibbled it dropping the cup on the upturned face of the recumbent man who retaliated by throwing the empty shell of the goober toward his saucy enemy a strain of music floated through the woodland and jasper arose and leaned forward inattentive attitude listen hear my old petes bugle our general is coming pete always bugles seethe conquering hero comes when he is insight lord what a world of tones pete can get out of that old bugle one might think it a magic bugle its plaintiveness almost broke ones heart that day he learned that our general was wounded at gainess mill two months later when he came back though his wound was so far from healed that he could not put on his coat every note of the bugle was a resurrection day note all the flowers that have ever made the world glad blossomed again you heard all the birds that had made music in the forest since the first songster trilled his lovesong from a branch in the primeval wood you clasped hands with all the friends whom you had loved in days gone by and dwelt with all the radiant things that had brightened your life it was melodized sunlight love transmuted into music life triumphant over death the tread of a horse was heard in the distance keeping time to the bugle notes and soon a powerful warsteed broke through the shrubbery his rider a slight graceful man who sat his horse as if the two were one was he who on the twelfth of september nearly two years before had enlisted in the army of the confederacy and on the following day had been commissioned captain now he was commander of a division of longstreets corps his hair long and curling now floated in the wind like a cloudveil he was not above medium height and the lines of grace he unconsciously followed suggested that his victories in the drawingroom might be no less notable than those he had won on the battlefield his face was of that fairness which defies the bronzing effect of sun and the darkening shades of time an expression of deeper thought was the only change that had come to it in nearly two fiery years which had passed since that wild ride from the north into the raging storm born of a race of warriors schooled in military art trained in camp and barracks and on the field a boy soldier in the land of the montezumas catching the flag from the hand of his fallen friend captain longstreet and carrying it to the height of chapultepec a determined man barring with slender force the gate of the west to a foreign foe he looked not like one to revel in martial deeds because of the wide and deep and high humanity dominating all smaller attributes as the spirit of god rules supreme over the world as he came riding down from the west his form was outlined darkly against the red wine of the sunset that splashed in crimson stains upon an ambertinted sky the general shouted one of the goober pea devotees on the hillside the cry swept from group to group and the air was rent with cheers the rider raised his cap and the smile that lit his face brought the rare blue glints to his eyes thus he rode till he had passed from view and ringing cheers followed him some distance in advance was a horseman the general recognized the tall form the strong erect shoulders the soldierly bearing and the superb horsemanship of lees old war horse whose corps was said by the federals to be the terror of their army the younger officer put his horse at speed and was soon beside the tall handsome corps commander how are you pickett said the lieutenant general laying his hand on the shoulder of his companion the two rode on together talking not as commanding and subordinate officer but as old friends who had met casually on the road of life you saw her last evening asked the older man turning his steelblue eyes upon his friend eyes that were stern and piercing except when the sunniness of his mood made them twinkle with mirth the sunniness was in them now you gave her my message she sent her thanks and good wishes in reply i am obliged to her but how do you reconcile it with military tactics to follow mars and worship at the shrine of venus both at once it does not need reconciliation it is the smile of the gentle goddess that gives us strength to follow the frowning god suppose mars should refuse to divide his kingdom ah but he never does he continues to shed his favors upon you and you have a whole empire of love to claim your devotion but i do not go galloping through forests and over rivers and past hostile sentries of nights just for a look and a word and come dashing back to the field with the first glint of morning a look and a word but they are worth the hardest ride that ever soldier took they rode on in silence for awhile then general longstreet said if we go into the north but what do you think of the plan i think not well of it nor i i cannot take the cheerful outlook presented by one of our chaplains that providence has at last consented to come down and take a proper view of the situation i like not to strike at other mens homes said the younger officer to defend my own i think my sword would of itself leap out of its scabbard his hand went to his side the lieutenant general was filled anew with wonderment that so slight a hand could wield so heavy a sword but he had seen the flash of that blade in the front of the battle like lightnings in a storm and men rushing after its blaze to the gates of death to choose our ground and let the enemy attack us is the way to win as at fredericksburg said general longstreet there was a battle i dream nights of the glory of that day and hear general lee say it is well that war is so terrible else we should become too fond of it it must have a horrible fascination if it could enchain him when every man who is killed is a personal loss and sorrow to him dear old marse bob what a heart he has thus lees old warhorse and he who was called the bayard of the confederacy rode down the amber path of sunset catherine marshall arose from the chair in the library where she had been pretending to herself that she was reading went to the window drew back the heavy curtain and looked out into the night from a jagged mass of clouds flamed a blaze of lightning which revealed her slim height wrapped in a shroud of fire a dark form came from a clump of magnolias into the white light uncle zeke she called come in out of the storm and tell me quick please uncle zeke what you have found out uncle zeke stepped through the low window into the library what do you mean cried the girl please tell me quick what you heard oh uncle zeke are you sure about your marse jasper but what did they say please please tell me catherine clasped her hands pleadingly uncle zeke fixed his eyes on a flicker of sheet lightning over at the edge of the world and prepared to make the effort of his life uncle zeke took a deliberate view of all that could be seen through the darkness and peered out to consider the prospect of clear weather catherine breathed a deep sigh for heavens sake no groaned kate i can go uncle zeke but you would get there after he was in a northern prison none of us doubts that my dear old black daddy but now we want something that will tell in another way lightning is the only horse on the plantation that can make the distance to brightview tonight and you know i am the only one who can ride him no there is but one way uncle zeke so please sir go and saddle my dear little horse while i run and get ready uncle zeke went away grumbling the pet horse whinnied when he heard kates voice and rubbed his silvery head against her shoulder i know its hard to be called away from your dreams my pretty but we are going to save life his life lightning kate mounted and holding out her hand to the old man said goodbye thank you uncle zeke please please dont let anybody know where i have gone you know how anxious papa is always and he would be so worried lightning took the low fence at a bound uncle zeke mounting old grey and following with great effort though with less rapidity there was a fork in the road and when kate came to it she paused a moment both led to brightview the left circuitous and requiring more time the right shorter and beset by obstacles she turned to the right and had ridden a short distance when she heard voices and the tramp of horses behind her the tramping ceased and she heard the riders discussing the question of which path to take after a short parley they rode to the left you can tell us the way to brightview if you will well cut it then and come to the point and tell us about the road confound you what do you mean by telling us all this rigmarole i wonder if you are telling us the truth old man uncle zeke ambled on his way satisfied that one young confederate officer owed his life to him ate was riding along the forest path when a dark form emerged from a clump of trees and two long arms were brandished aloft lightning swerved aside and his quick movement nearly unseated his rider dont be afraid child it is only your friend the old hermit who comes to serve you your mission is needless pearl of the mist you are riding through the forest at this strange hour to save jasper carrington from the yankees his danger lies not there but here nearer home he has an enemy because of you tell him to ride with all speed and to watch the shadows that follow him through the woods tonight thank you and god bless you i will give him your message she smiled at the faith which lingered with her from the days of her childhood when the old hermit had been half terror and half guide for her and the smile had not vanished when glancing back she saw the faintly defined form of a horseman following her leaning forward she whispered to lightning and dashing across the glade entered the driveway of bright view ts that you uncle jerry she asked as an old man sleepily answered her summons its your miss kate uncle jerry dont you know me i am very well thank you uncle jerry and i hope that you are well no uncle jerry i have a permit from colonel dodge to keep him the lowbranching trees bordering the path touched kate and dripped moonkissed drops of rain upon her as she passed jasper carrington opened the door to her light knock exclaiming in surprise why miss kate how on earth did you get here at this hour too then a pretty girl ran out and kissed her and a sweetfaced matron came forward and took her into her arms saying we were just speaking of you dear kate her hands are cold mother please give her some of this old madeira that you have hidden away through all these years and just brought up tonight in honor of your scapegrace son kate drank the wine declaring that she was neither cold nor tired and did not need anything though her pale cheeks belied her words you know i was going to see you tomorrow yes i knew you were and i came hereto tell you not to come for there is a detachment of yankees after you uncle zeke heard them planning it and you must not stay here either a minute longer than you can help they said you waylaid their messenger and took the dispatches and that they regarded you as a dangerous character you see dear your suddenness surprises them and they would be more comfortable if you went north for a time there is something else too said kate as jasper having yielded to the wishes of all was going be cautious as you ride through the woods tonight and be careful wherever you are for there is a shadow on your pathway that threatens a greater evil to you than the yankees how do you know this my little prophet the hermit told me and then then i saw the shadow myself following along my pathway so please please be careful i am not afraid but for your sake dearest i will try he looked back at her as he rode away into the starry silence of the night and said laughingly i declare i am falling into a belief in hermits and shadows and had she warned me that a sheeted specter was on my track i should have looked for it with perfect confidence the witchery of the nightshrouded forest enwrapped him and he fell adreaming the woodsy odors clung around him with myriad hands of enchantment a bird awakened and trilled out a greeting to the night he passed a narrow path that made a detour into the woods and came back to the main road a short distance ahead a man who was following him came to this point and plunged into the side path at the crossroad he awaited the approach of carrington who was awakened from his reverie by the whiz of a ball over his head when you have succeeded in emptying your pistol at me you will please be so good as to explain who you are and why you are making so unskilful an effort to murder a man in the dark take all the time you want and dont be frightened i have no pistol and would not stain my sword with the blood of a coward the dark horseman had come near and the misty light drifting across the pathway fell on his face do you suppose that if i had taken serious aim i could not have put a bullet through your head as easily as over your hat i merely wished to arrest your attention oh i see you now no need to tell me who you are every man in the south knows campo who saved his life by betraying his countrymen i dare say you can shoot it is a ruffanly sport enough the worst i have ever heard about your shooting is that it is in the wrong direction campo threw his pistol to the ground i have a sword you have called me coward and traitor that means that one of us must die you cannot refuse me the satisfaction of learning which one it is to be the truth does not demand satisfaction it is its own justification at least you must defend yourself cried campo drawing his sword and riding fiercely upon jasper campo was reckless and made wild lunges that fell wide of their mark jasper struck the sword from his grasp and the horse frightened promptly threw campo and dashed off across the moonlit sward the dawn was staining the east with a pink light shot with golden arrows when carring ton rode by the pickets guarding the camp he dismounted in front of his tent as the drums sounded the reveille i cant get em up i cant get em up i cant get em up in the morning i cant get em up i cant get em up i cant get em up at all from his own tent came a repetition of the call clear full repeated in bugle tones and ending in a prolonged note which appealed to him with a force he had never understood then the curtain of the tent was lifted and old pete greeted him with a cry of joy i think i should know your bugle call pete too dead or alive but here is something from my mother here is a package also from some one else give it to uncle pete she said and tell him not to forget my message throwing his bridle to pete he entered the central tent darkness yet lingered inside and on a small table was a tallow candle which had burned nearly down to the wooden block that served as a candlestick its wavering light glimmered over a map spread upon the table above which two men were bending in puzzled study a majorgeneral seated on a campchair and a brigadier looking over his shoulder the brigadier was tall and rugged with dark face deeply marked as if each experience of life had engraved its line in the history written on his countenance there was nothing of the reckless dash of the enthusiastic warrior in his aspect yet one looking at him felt that when the time should come he would lead a forlorn hope to the mouth of the guns and fall before them it must have been in a spasmodic ebullition of youthful spirits that he had made an onslaught upon his comrade jubal a early at west point and had been expelled from that venerable institution for such premature display of valor the man sitting at the table leaned back and looked up at his companion do you know armistead he said i am learning the true value of a war map delighted to know that it has a value pickett i have always thought that the one exception to the theory set forth by the poet nothing walks with aimless feet was the man who attempted to follow a war map just so the real value of a war map is in pointing out with definiteness one of the many imaginable conformations of the country and setting it beyond the limits of the possible leaving us free range to choose among the rest i used to fancy that if an earth man should be turned loose on jupiter instinct would lead him somewhere since this war began i have learned more about the limitations of the race once on the chickahominy i sent for immediate reenforcements a detachment of picked men started out under the leadership of one of the most accomplished officers in the service they marched all night and in the morning found themselves insight of the camp from which they had started what had become of you pickett in the meantime i had caught another detachment which had been ordered northward and had traveled due south till it accidentally fell in with me yet our men have hunted over this region since the days of their infancy ah here is colonel carrington jasper saluted and handed a paper to the general thank you colonel you carried my message promptly and have returned earlier than i expected my return was hastened general by the necessity of declining a pressing invitation from our northern friends to remain with them for a time northern hospitality is occasionally embarrassing to the busy southerner in haste to get on with his work i commend your strength of mind in resisting their fascinations colonel jasper saluted and withdrew returning to his tent where pete had prepared a breakfast that did honor to his title of commissary general hen kate returned home the next morning she found her father in his office leaning back in his big armchair smoking a figstemmed corncob pipe a young man whose face she could not see was talking to him black pomp was sitting on the floor making other pipes of corncobs and fitting them to long fragrant figstems hallo hallo here comes my katydid where have you been you little runaway nobody on the plantation could tell me where you were come ladybird account for your early morning ride but first here is a surprise for you how do you do cousin kate said the surprise i am so glad to see you but you did not expect me did you garnett how lovely lovely to see you again how and when did you come we are not so very far away and i asked permission to run over i was so hungry fora sight of home folks how does it go garnett dear is it very terrible yes god only knows how terrible but i could not bear not to be among the others there has never been a war in our country without a phillips in it fighting for his flag the fight was never for a flag but for an idea said colonel marshall the old idea still lives sheltered under our new flag a sectional party elected a sectional president who declared war without the authority of congress and invaded the sovereign states whose only offense was that they asserted their right and power to fight for their own union under the constitution which their forefathers had made if you and my cousin will excuse me ill go and change my habit while you discuss flags but remember there is but one flag for me the stars and bars and but one idea freedom catherine waved her hand to them and passed out into the hall and up the stairway the gaze of the young man following her till she disappeared god bless the women chuckled the old colonel they will save the south in spite of the devil if you only had a sweetheart now garnetta true and patriotic southern girl like your cousin garnett looked over the head of pomp and across a sunbathed slope hedged by a dark belt of woods he did not see the trees nor the slope nor the sun he saw only a radiant face with a dazzle of deep eyes the same eyes that had smiled back at him as catherine went up the stairway here is a rosebud for each of you said kate returning with a jacqueminot pinned at the throat of her white dress and two buds in her hand guess what is in store for you cousin i am going to take you to nannie wickhams ball tonight could you get an invitation for me at this late hour invitation they would tear my hair out if i did not bring you how delightful to dance with the dear soldiers who come in their uniforms and look oh so handsome just as you do curtseying elaborately the uniforms may be somewhat dingy from hard wear to be sure but nothing can keep a confederate soldier from being beautiful and well there never were such dancers anywhere else in the whole world i didnt know any but our crowd were within a days march yes one of the regiments is camped down in the glen for the night on the way to join picketts division the ball is given for them all we are afraid of is that the yankees will find it out but i dont think they will theyve sent too many men north to take any risks usually we have dry bread balls but ung lige found a beetree today and brought home a great pan of honey and we are to have a honeypulling tonight how delightful and you are to wear a white dress and a red rose of course they are my colors they are my colors too that evening he was at the foot of the stairs when kate came down looking like a white cloud floating against a dungray curtain of space at the belt of her soft white dress was massed a cluster of giant of battle roses what wondrous draperies you wartime maidens wear this robe belonged to one of my grandmothers away back in the centuries she wore it at a ball in the court of louis the superb and danced with prince cond but the roses bloomed today and belong to the sunshine the roses blossomed in the sunshine of your presence and belong to you as for the robe i venture the court lady did not look half so pretty in it as her descendant does cond could tell you better than that flatterer but just you wait till you see nannie wickham she has a really and truly new dress smuggled through the lines it is a dream and so is she and you shall fall in love with her that is impossible i have fallen in love oh but old love affairs do not count the carriage rolled through the southern dusk along a dreamful lane and kate chatted gaily with the recklessness of youth that dances lightly on whether cannons boom or doves of peace coo softly soon they were at nannies gate and in a moment were whirled away in the light and glow and laughter and music it seems to me that we are dancing on the rim of a volcano said garnett as he walked with nannie wickham between dances yes some people have been calling us frivolous and saying growly things about our dancing lately because of the increasing anxiety since general pemberton has been repulsed at jackson and vicksburg is in danger but general joe johnston is there and everything must come out right where he is my old mammy shakes her head when she dresses me and says shes had signs an weall better be havin prarmeetins steader dancin nannie stopped suddenly what was that listen didnt you hear something yes it sounded like the tramp of horses and the clank of steel hurrying back to the ballroom they ran upon pomp whose eyes revolved in an ecstasy of terror as he warningly cried out lieutenant hetherington signal to camp for the boys at once ladies to the upper rooms lights out awed by the colonels commanding tone the girls fled upstairs pomp crawled under the table over the dancing hall darkness fell and fiddling czsar stood with uplifted bow as if petrified in swing your pardners hands all round look there is a flag of truce said nannie they are coming to summon us to surrender we will die first asserted catherine valiantly thats easy enough to talk about replied nannie dolorously colonel dasham calls upon the confederate officers within to surrender and thereby save the house from destruction called out the bearer of the flag of truce my compliments to colonel dasham and tell him that we are much obliged but that we can protect the house without his assistance the truce withdrew and soon a hailstorm of shot was heard answering shots were fired from the windows and one of the assailants fell and was carried away poor fellow said kate always ready to sympathize with misfortune i hope he is not hurt much we have the advantage you see we are in the dark and they in full moonlight oh me they are separating and some are going to the back door whispered nannie and listen the rest of the boys are coming the men from camp came swinging around the curve and the girls waved their handkerchiefs from the window a shower of rifleballs greeted the attacking party and the detachment at the rear door joined their comrades in front after a skirmish they retreated to the woods pursued by the lieutenant and his men from the camp and followed by the cheers of the colonels forces in which the girls joined heartily hurrah girls cried kate we have won a battle were you frightened asked colonel wilmer coming up the stairway followed by garnett frightened replied kate it was glorious but that poor fellow who was shot where is he i dont think there was much blood shed at any rate no wounded left on the field upon their return to magnolia lawn kate and garnett stopped for a moment upon the veranda and looked out into the moonlight where the pines were black against the silvery wall why do beautiful things seem sad asked kate as a south wind swept up from the river and lifting a branch of the rosevine brushed it across her cheek i suppose it is because we cannot take all their beauty into eyes and heart at once there is a reason though why all this stretching his arms out toward river and wide white space is especially sad to me tonight because i must say goodbye perhaps for an even longer separation than before oh i hope not surely not i go tonight to join armisteads brigade oh i am so sorry no i dont mean that i am sorry either im glad it is just what i would have you do and then you will see jasper jasper jasper she looked up shyly yes didnt you know he was silent for an instant gazing out into the blackness of the pines then he said gently ii congratulate you cousin mine i knew you would now i want you to do something for me anything to the extent of my power kate jasper is so brave so daring so almost reckless i want you to make friends with him and guard him from the dangers that he will not see take care of him for me her uplifted face glowed with love and entreaty but in his eyes was the light of self abnegation he took her hand and lifted it to his lips if my life can purchase his it will be freely given for your sake thank you both lives will come back to make me happy if god wills he said solemnly she watched him ride down the lane looking after him until he was hidden in the forest the winding empty road lying black across the moonlight as kate finished the letter she looked up wistfully at her father and said oh father if i had only been a boy thank the lord that you are not a boy my daughter do you love me better as i am papa dear if you were my son instead of my daughter even loved as you are now i should give you up though it were to death the army of northern virginia was on the road to chambersburg the march was necessarily slow for not even the commander inchief had any information regarding the federal movements colonel carrington had sent for garnett and they were side by side there is something i intended to tell you garnett said about that campo fellow who manages to keep himself tangled up with us in the most incomprehensible way i did not tell you of the first time it was when i had been mistaken for you and put into a prison house to wait for him to pass upon my identity the next time was that day in the skirmish as we crossed the line he tried to stick a sword into you i thank god i was a shade too quick for him and he disappeared just as you downed that yankee captain he is the meanest kind of a scoundrel and coward said jasper thanks to your friendly offices he gives you more trouble than he does me for which i am sorry but i am very grateful to you for staying his murderous hand they passed by fields in which the ripening grain promised a veritable harvest of gold garnett thought of the desolate waste through which he had marched in virginia the fields were there ready to yield their treasures to the skilful touch but the tillers were gone and there was no hand stretched out to help those barren acres to blossom forth and fulfil their hospitable mission the orchards in which the burdened branches almost touched the ground with the weight of their fruitage reminded garnett of an orchard where in boyhood he gathered apples red and golden on the road to maryland he had seen it again it was an old battlefield now and the firescarred trees stretched their ghostly gray arms to the sky as if asking the vengeance of heaven on the wickedness of man in this fair and prosperous land homelike dwellings nestled away in the greenery of beautiful trees and looked bewitchingly out from their leafy bowers in virginia the army had passed by piles of ashes where in the olden days stately homes had given garnett loving welcome by lonely deserted houses that had once been sunny and bright as they were passing one of these mansions an old negro hobbled out to greet garnett the tears sprang to garnetts eyes only an old servant with his lovegift left to greet him now along the road bordered with plenty they came to chambersburg where there was none to give them welcome or even a passing word they marched quietly through the town their band silent for the order was that no music should be played lest it might offend the citizens through an almost deserted street between rows of closed houses they went till they were near the limits of the town here several girls who had been drawn by curiosity to the veranda of a cottage asked for some music and were greeted with the girl i left behind me home sweet home and auld lang syne but these noncommittal strains were not their idea of southern music and they called for dixie they were answered by the gentle notes of her bright smile haunts me still and the division marched on to camp the men carried away pleasant memories of the little town among the hills for the dwellers therein did not long resist the courtesy and kindness of the confederate leader and when marching orders came many a word of goodwill followed the southern soldiers to gettysburg hands of the dead faraway hands of the living dream hands that dwelt but in imagination all seemed stretched forth to garnett and jasper as the old division marched through the woods in which they had halted to await the morning summons to the field faces looked out at them from behind the trees faces shrined in their hearts by memory faces hovering mistily on the far horizon of their fancy was there ever so ghostly a wood as this that lay between their nights bivouac and the fighting line at gettysburg only the rustling of feet upon the grass broke the stillness yet was the silence full of sound whispers of voices and the echoes of yesterdays guns thrilling on the air when they passed through the line of woods fringing seminary ridge morning yet waited behind the hills the men lay in the long grass and the trees kept guard around them the weary soldiers held the attitudes into which they had thrown themselves as if they might have been stone figures cast aside by an impatient sculptor some fell asleep others waited grimly for the dawn the strangest dawn that ever gloomed into their lives garnett resting on his elbow looked toward the east where a ridge slightly overtopped the ground on which he lay what was between his fancy could not show how the day had gone he did not know no tidings had come from the battle except the dull echoes of the guns that had shivered the air on the road from chambersburg the crash of garys pistol broke the stillness and sent echoes reverberating among the hills day was ushered in with the ominous greeting which befitted its awful destiny some of the men aroused from their half slumbers looked in the direction from which the sound came a quiver as of a suddenly awakened force ready for combat thrilled through garnetts veins the man who had been at antietam lay quiet he was still asleep a deeper silence fell over the ridge a stillness that stretched out in awesome gloom to the sky and reached down to earth after what seemed to garnett a soundless eternity the silence was broken by the tread of horses coming down the line in the shimmer of dawn he could see the faces of the riders and the color of their horses as they rode along every man in the army knew the powerful gray that carried the commander he and his rider were one so closely were they identified with all the exploits of the army of the south garnett never saw that stately figure mounted on traveler without a glow of pride beside him was a taller heavier man he who bore worthily the title of old war horse affectionately bestowed upon him by the commanding general j garnetts glance swept over these two figures and centered on the third of the group wondering as he had many times wherein lay the power of that man smaller than the two with whom he rode slight delicately formed he was in strong contrast to his companions he sat his horse with the grace of one who rides to win a guerdon from the hand of beauty rather than to meet the foe in deadly conflict his face was almost womanly fair and his soft dark hair swept backward in the morning wind like the hair garnett remembered in a picture at magnolia lawn of a minstrel who sang of the past in the ancient halls of his ancestors were ever grace and delicacy so opposed to the rude idea of war as in his person and life history yet men went down into the infernal pit of battle and were drowned in seas of fire for love of him and the glory of following where he led having been strictly enjoined to silence the men dared not cheer they arose and stood reverently with bared heads as the horsemen rode down the line in silent review the last death review and every eye of the long line was on the slender man who rode the black charger and held his cap lifted above his head thus they watched their leader till the shadows hid him from view in the grass in front of the forest line they lay through hours of beating sun there were no sleepers now each man was awake to the heat that poured upon him as from a burning cauldron occasionally one moved restlessly now and then there was a whisper to a comrade the baby the youngest soldier in the regiment crept close to garnett and held his hand his yellow curls were matted damply over his head in his eyes were depths of unspoken sadness i want you to do something for me for somehow i feel that i shall not live out this day nonsense boy nonsense you will live to be graybearded and some day you will hold your grandchildren on your knee and tell them of how we won a glorious victory and saved our southland the boy shook his head sadly men in our way of life sometimes know there is something in their hearts that tells them brace up my boy brace up we all have a feeling of that kind in the presence of a great danger we come up out of the conflict with hearts stronger because of the trial and lives better for the victory i dont know what it is but i feel that my heart will be stilled in this battle and when you march back to the capital of our new nation wont you find my mother and tell her about me and give her this letter oh tell her how dearly i love her and that the proudest thing in her boys life is in trying to be worthy of her and in giving the life she gave him to his country ill take the letter of course boy but suppose i should still keep you company at the end of the day there was a long silence and then the man who had been at antietam turned over and growled by george fellows i say this makes me think of what tom august said to squire minturn whats that asked the man next him you know the squire puts on as many airs as if hed swallowed a hurricane and it was breaking out on him he met tom and said in his swell way well sir i suppose your voice is still for war and tom said yes squire devilish still the fittest place where man can die is where he dies for man a cannonshot shivered the awful silence while it echoed from the hills another shot thundered out and a cloud of smoke hung over the plain then came a crash of artillery and between the two ridges was a blazing sea over which a heavy curtain of smoke waved and tossed tumultuously like a wrack of stormclouds in a raging wind the hills trembled with the roar of battle it was as if warring worlds had rushed together in one stupendous conflict through a rolling ocean of smoke and dust flaming arrows darted across the field them pesky things allus pears to be aimin straight at a fellers eyes grumbled one of armisteads men blinking as a burning shell swept past him a man who was lying near leaped suddenly forward and fell his blood spattering on garnetts sleeve the shriek of a shell hurtled by and a little distance from him he saw the earth torn up and heard the dying groans of comrades even in the mighty uproar looking upon the fire and smoke of the most terrific cannonading the world ever knew garnett pitied those who had fallen at the threshold of the battle who could never go down into that sea of surging flame and windtossed smoke and charge the firecrested heights on a hill overlooking the valley was the stately form of the commander on his powerful gray horse he turned to pickett mounted by his side and pointed to a clump of trees flanked by a glittering array of artillery and infantry on the ridge opposite general can you take that height i can sir if it can be taken while the roar of the cannon filled the valley and fiery fuses were still darting through the blackness general pickett came down the line the men sprang to their feet and saluted as he pointing to the flamecrowned hill explained what they were to do cheer after cheer followed him jaspers head was uncovered and a light wind blew his hair back as garnett looked at him leading his regiment and across the distance heard a sweet voice say take care of him for me take care of him in camp and on field i promise he had said with all the solemnity with which he would have made a vow to his creator his pledge to the woman he loved came back to him with the touch of the south wind and he renewed the promise in his heart to guard with his own life the man who was dear to her what after all was his life in comparison with the happiness of her loving heart a stray shell from the opposite ridge struck down a soldier at garnetts side the baby moved quietly in and the line was unbroken the boy looked up and smiled as a child might have looked at his protector garnett took his hand and pressed it affectionately it seemed a mournful prophecy that death should have placed them side by side as they were about to march down the fatal slope the soldier in front of him turned to a comrade and said we are to charge that height les fixing his gaze southward he said then this will be a sad day for virginia and stretching out his arms he called out solemnly goodbye virginia he thought of the little cottage nestling away in the blue ridge in that beloved old state which bounded the dreams of his youth and the memories of his manhood goodbye surged through the heart of garnett and a radiance of dark eyes and a swaying of a slim young form draped in white with a crimson jacqueminot at the throat was the vision that passed before his eyes as he shut them to the smokewreathed valley and the fiery height the gaze of jasper was directed straightforward to the forest of guns on the hill in front garnett could see only the set pose of the head with its stern unwavering lines maybe that was why all things came to jasper was the same farewell echoing sorrowfully in his heart or was he intent only upon scaling that deadly wall beyond garnett watched the graceful form on the black charger as their leader took his place at their head his long dark hair floating back in the wind forward picketts men started on their deathmarch they moved out from the forest calmly and steadily as if drawn up for a grand review two great armies watched them in admiring awe over on seminary hill the man on the gray horse looked on at the costly sacrifice the south was making for its cause on cemetery height the men in blue were silent watching the majestic scene the rhythmic motion of the thousands of tramping feet had so taken possession of garnetts imagination that he seemed to have been for ages walking in that solemn procession the resounding tramp tramp tramp filled all the world garnetts gaze was fixed on the commander far away in front leading his men into the flames of battle with an air of chivalrous lightness and grace such as he might have worn had he led them in picturesque procession to enliven a festalday he marveled over the daring that could enable a man to maintain a poise like that at the open door of death he thought of what he had heard a commanding officer say give george pickett an order and he will storm the gates of hell by the silent batteries the old war horse stood with general alexander of the artillery looking with grave face at the long lines moving toward the smokeshrouded valley as they filed by he acknowledged with a gesture the salutation of the officers at the crest a deadly roar and blinding flash from the guns across the valley met them all around men were falling but garnett kept his eyes fixed upon the gallant figure in front and followed the vacant places were filled and the line passed on down the slope into open ground through the storm of balls and shells raining from cemetery height as the smoke lifted the sad and silent man standing by the batteries saw the solid ranks moving steadily on in symphonic rhythm their guns flashing in the sun wright says it is not so hard to go there said the artillery commander he was nearly there with his brigade yesterday the difficulty is to stay there general longstreet looked across at the dark lines of men and guns on the opposite ridge yes yes that is the difficulty he said but the guns garnett had looked at them with pride and confidence as he passed when their bulldog voices sounded across the valley they might serve as the overture to a symphony of triumph the guns that was the anxious thought of the corps commander as his gaze followed the men on their descent into the valley of death he knew why the guns by which he stood were silent as they sullenly looked down upon a movement which they could not support stop pickett and replenish the ammunition he said to the artillery commander we cant do that sir was the mournful reply it would take an hour to distribute it and meanwhile the enemy would improve the time longstreet turned from the silent guns to acknowledge the salute of a tall officer who was leading his brigade down the fatal slope with a start of surprise he recognized general garnett who for days had been following the army in an ambulance he had made his attendants lift him to the saddle and fasten him there that he might lead his men to the glorious death that blazed before his vision general alexanders heart leaped at the sight of the friend whom he had not seen for months and following its promptings he went down the line and joined general garnett and rode side by side with him to the rim of the slope there he paused and held out his hand goodbye and good luck to you old man he said a soldiers luck returned general garnett with serene uplifted gaze as if even then he felt the outrushing tide of lifeblood which would on that day wash away the fiery letters in which kernstown had been graven upon his valiant heart the line reached open ground under a storm of balls from cemetery ridge the gaps the guns had made in the ranks filled up and the solid living wall went forward as if the dead that covered the ground like the fallen leaves of autumn had added the impulse of their own lives to the strength of their comrades a long blue line sprang suddenly up from the grass which had hidden it from view fired and ran on loading and turning to shoot again the battleflag in front of garnett fell before it reached the ground he took it from the hand of the baby who looked a last farewell and faintly whispered remember again the ranks closed up and went on unfalteringly as garnett caught the flag one of his comrades sprang forward with the same design he looked around and saw the smokeblackened face of the man who had bade farewell to virginia garnett passed the flag to him and they went on together left oblique swiftly and steadily they obeyed while a deafening roar filled the valley and a rain of balls swept down from the cannon in front of them again were the wide gaps filled as were never such gaps of horror filled in the long story of warfare front forward straight down upon the center now on onthe glory of the battle sweeping around them enfolding them in a mantle of flame urging them forward with exultant feet and hearts on fire forward quick march where the balls fell thickest and the fire seemed to center in a condensed heart of flame garnett saw the horseman on whom his eyes were fixed pause and look over the field like a statue he sat while a leaden hail showered around him with his comrades garnett rushed by over the fence that crossed the field they leaped the line breaking at the moment of clearing but instantly at command reforming under a fiery storm from the batteries on the heights amid the explosion of shells that filled the air while the cries of the wounded and dying pierced their hearts faster men faster they heard above the roar of the guns and the tramp of the feet then the voice fell on silence general garnett was dead come on boys shouted another voice and a sword flashed high in the sun a hat borne upon its point the tall rugged man who carried it aloft pointed to the blazing hill and urged the men forward his own daring furnishing a magnet that was irresistible the leader on the black warhorse stopped on the highroad that crossed the field and sat like a figure of stone the battle hot around him a staff officer came back from carrying an order you are losing your spurs captain bright instead of winning them said the general captain bright followed the glance of his leader and saw that his spur had been shot through and was hanging from his boot the general calmly viewed the scene his keen eye taking in every movement the men rushed by and garnett thrilled with ardor as he saw the motionless erect figure under the falling shot and bursting shells on the other side of the line a man in blue lifted his rifle and took careful aim at the form standing out so boldly against the light then he lowered his gun and turned back three of his comrades were putting down their guns we cant kill a man as brave as that they said over on the right a gleam of bayonets and afire of musketry blazed into the faces of the little band it reeled and fell back then rallied and pressed on and the two opposing forces were intermingled their muskets crossing in fierce combat jasper dismounted was in front of garnett resisting the onslaught of a tall dark man the raven thought garnett he thrust his sword into the heart of jaspers assailant who fell and was trampled under many feet struggling toward the height the man who bore the flag fell and garnett would have stopped to aid him dont mind me said the wounded man carry the flag to the front a horse came dashing by and the fallen man caught his bridle like kendall i can be a hitching post he said garnett bore the flag onward over the stone wall and up the hill they followed the sword that flashed a silver path for them till they stood upon the flaming crest the first line of defenders fell back and garnett waved his battleflag over the gun beside which stood the man whose swordflash had lit the way in a seething heart of fire he saw the leader fall forced back by the rally of the men on the height the little remnant of survivors reeled down the hill jasper and garnett together a storm of bullets following them as they went halfway down the slope jasper fell back and garnett caught him in his arms jasper are you hurt old fellow jasper made no answer and garnett carried him on a mortal faintness seizing him suddenly but he heeded it not for above the roar of the guns the cries of the wounded the tramp of men and horses he heard a soft voice saying take care of him for me take care of him for me he laid his comrade upon the ground and poured down his throat a drink from his canteen he is not dead he will not die cannot for he has love to live for and it will take him safely back to her as he sank upon the ground he heard the sound of hobbling feet and the face of eagle heart was thrust into his own fagleheart old fellow did you come to tell me goodbye i know you carried your rider valiantly into the battle till he fell from your back he could not have gone on without you for he was too ill to ride any other oh i am proud of you eagleheart and i am glad i lent you to the brave general garnett i wonder if he knows that his namesake soldier follows him so soon the pathetic brown eyes of eagleheart looked wistfully into his with insistent appeal then garnett saw that one of his feet was shot off and led by instinct he had hobbled to his master fagleheart i love you and will do what you ask of me goodbye old fellow he drew the pistol from his belt and took sure aim a long slow quiver a deepdrawn sigh and eagleheart was at rest garnett moved nearer to jasper and put his arm over him he was too weak to lift himself to see how it was with his friend but he felt that all was right a buglenote floated over the field faint as if the gentle muse feared to enter upon the terrible scene plaintive as if the woes of a universe weighed it down thank god that is old pete he will find him for her said garnett as he sank into unconsciousness that is old pete bugling the dirge in the greatest deathmarch the world has ever known thought the leader of the little remnant falling back from the firecrested height and as pete saw the general he involuntarily struck the triumphant note with which he had always greeted him see the conquering hero comes but memory brought a sorrowful strain into which was woven the tragedy of a glorious and futile effort listening he who had led his men through the storm saw visions as in a cloud the aspiration of battle the thrill of the charge his heart leaped with the impulse of victory sank with the knowledge of defeat then the bugle tones passed on and soared above the clank of men surging back from a glorious defeat that held no less of nobility than would have shone in the crown of victory it caught the heartbreak of wounds and death the love and longing of passing souls the agony of sadder souls that must remain on earth and remember the woe and horror of that field of destruction and carried it aloft mingled with the flowerfragrance of loves farewell and the dawnglory of the morning heights of eternal life to beat against the gates of that city where peace reigns forever it came softly to garnett as he lay touching the borderland with one hand while the other reached longingly gropingly back toward loved ones whom he was leaving there was a familiar tone in the strain as if it were wafted to him on the winds of longgone summers it did not come to him with the terrors of battle the darkness of death he was faraway from the worlds wars to him it bore the fragrance of woodflowers that grew along the paths he had trod in boyhood it was aglow with the sunlight that bathed a hillside where he used to play he saw again the long grass waving in the wind a song came lilting down the years from the parted red lips of a hazeleyed girl with a forest of songbirds in her throat over toward the sunset the little band had swept down the hill beyond his ment and hearing i have kept my faith catherine i send him back to you and to love sighed garnett as old petes notes bugling for his master brought him back to consciousness he lay still for a time his lashes sweeping down upon his cheek and then as his soul took its flight her voice came to him on the golden thread of an old song a smile lit up his face he opened his eyes and whispered i knew you would come sweetheart i feel the touch of your hand and your sweet eyes are lighting the way for me goodbye goodbye kate like a bit of wreckage tossed up from a stormy sea jasper lay by the roadside through the darkness that environed him he heard a last fond goodbye spoken by a loved voice but he could make no answer the sound of a bugle called him and he tried to struggle back to light but sank again into shadows old pete anxious ever for the fate of the young master whom destiny had confided to him found him after much bugling and praying and a perilous search he turned to garnett whose arm was over jaspers shoulder so saying pete after listening again at garnetts heart lifted him tenderly and carried him away laying him down gently and taking a mournful leave of him with tears rolling down his cheeks the faithful servant returned to jasper no answering look of consciousness came to the still face in response to the stirring notes that had so often aroused the young soldier to the duties of the day whether the magic of his sweethearts bugle song had the power ascribed to it or not the young colonel opened his eyes before it was finished is it time to get up pete where is lieutenant phillips i thought i heard him call your miss catherines name was i dreaming or was it his spirit he is not dead pete is he pete laughed to carry out the deceit but turned his head away pete was soon back with his assistant carefully as they lifted jasper he sank again into merciful unconsciousness and knew not when he was taken across the deathred valley when they reached the hill on the other side of the field consciousness came back to jasper and with it a twinge of pain which brought a groan from the lips that were set with grim fierceness in the effort to suppress all sign of suffering easy boys easy said a low deep voice in a tone so gentle that the sound of it soothed away a part of the misery of the undressed wound stiffening in the burning heat of the path that skirted the battlefield carry him gently for his pain and for the memory of the brave fellows we leave behind us jasper lifted his heavy eyelids slowly and looked up to see what wondrous face might belong with this voice that was like a strain of halfforgotten music drifting around him in a dream which was otherwise only darkness and fear there was a familiar note in the voice as if it might have fallen upon his ear often in the past when life was full in his veins and meant so much more than it could ever mean again the painworn face was so filled with tenderness that it brought tears to his eyes only to look at it tears that took away half his suffering in their flow but filled his heart with a deeper wider paina sense of loss that seemed worldwide the face into which jasper looked was the same he had seen when the morning light made a dim radiance under the canopy of the trees brilliant with the greenery of summer the face at sight of which the men who dared not lift their voices in the ringing cheers that welled up in their hearts had raised their caps and bowed their heads in reverence and lovethe same face yet not the same for the battle ardor had died out and left it pale with the sorrow of a great loss perhaps the greatest loss that had ever come to a man since the first battle for supremacy was fought in a wildly ambitious world for over each dead form that lay on that bloodcrimsoned field his heart mourned as a fatherheart mourns over the grave of a son the tigereyes that had flamed with the fire of the coming conflict were softened in a gray tender light sadder than tears courage my lad we shall soon be among friends whose hearts and hands will bring you comfort the leader of the few who had in so short a time traveled the road to immortality and returned to earthly living looked back along the way far better for us he said stretching out his arms toward the long windrows left by the reaper death had we stayed with them but if j can cross that valley and live cannot you thus the brave tenderhearted general pickett after the battle stood beside one of his boys as the sun sank behind the hills to rise again in golden glory when the night should pass the sun that had gilded the flag of the southern cross had set to rise no more forever catherine stood in the oakpaneled dininghall and looked from the open window across to the servants quarters in the center of the wide space in front a dusky group had gathered the night was murky and the scene was lit by pineknot torches held in the hands of some halfgrown youths whose faces upturned to the flaring light seemed to catch a demoniac glow that wavered and changed with the flickering glare as the company moved about in the red light one might have fancied that a group from subterranean regions had met for spectral revelry kate was thinking only how good and faithful they had been these black people of magnolia lawn politically they had been free for half a year practically they had been free much longer than that for had they wished to leave the old plantation there had been nothing to prevent it was their home and they loved it what more could the wilderness of freedom offer them many of the neighboring servants had chosen the uncertainties of that great unknown country rather than the safety of the tried and known she did not think it strange that they had done so though the offered gift bear nothing of freedom but its name it yet holds out to the imagination such brilliant possibilities that only a great love can outshine it in glory such a love these faithful hearts held for the old home and its inmates there was a barbaric splendor in the scene that carried kates fancy into the fantastic shadows of oriental traditions the negroes had formed a semicircle around the illumined space and the light flickering over their faces gave them an unearthly expression of awesome enchantment an old man who formed the keystone of the arch began to sing slowly in a deep melancholy tone a song commemorative of the manifold virtues and sorrowful fate of one poor uncle ned who had lived a long time ago and had gone to a rest well earned by a protracted life of good deeds and selfsacrifice he had apparently been forced to relinquish most of the attractions which earthly existence offers to the average human being all joined in the chorus which welled up in a heavy surge of woe as the first note of the chorus swelled out in a volume of sad melody a girl glided into the center of the circle and began a slow weird mystic dance swaying backward and forward and from side to side keeping time with her sinuous movements to the rise and fall of the dirge to them the life and death of the good old black man of whom they sang who had died long ago long ago and who had no wool on de top er his haid in de place whar de wool ought ter grow were as real and as new as were the scenes of their everyday life when the funeral ode was ended the same deep rich voices rang out in a merry song with a chorus of laughter after each stanza a halfgrown boy ran into the circle and began a clogdance to the gay notes of the banjo and the clank of the bones followed by another and yet another all joining in heartily with the laughing chorus to which their twinkling feet kept time what children they are thought kate as she joined in the laugh they weep over imaginary sorrows and laugh over fancied joys without a thought of the realities of life ah here comes uncle zeke why are you not having fun down at the cabins with the others dear me what has happened to please you so what is it uncle zeke do tell me are you sure uncle zeke she cried her cheeks aglow and her eyes dancing victory for one instant kates heart stood still as if it would never beat again the world was dark before her and she heard strange sounds far off on an unknown shore something seemed to grasp at her throat and she could not breathe intense joy had brought a helpless pain like that which comes with intense grief then light came back tears filled her eyes the tears that lie alike at the heart of a great happiness and a great sorrow her cheeks which had gone suddenly pale with the shock of joy blossomed out redder than the roses that bloomed in omars garden the triumph in her heart flamed into her eyes and dried away the tears her first thought was of jasper the war was ended and he would soon come home come home to her the long terror of battle was over and sweet peace had come at last for what could there be more to do than to go to washington and offer to withdraw the army from northern soil on condition that the south should own herself and live her own life what a magnificent glorious life it would be with their wide fertile lands their beautiful homes the power to make their own laws adapted to their own needs but what were laws and national interests to kate jasper was coming home what wider meaning than that had peace for her and garnett yes he would come too in the first rush of joy she had not thought of him she would be glad to see him though he was a dear fellow and had been good to jasper that either would not come had never dawned upon her thought lovers and cousins and fathers and brothers had been left on the field and sweethearts and cousins and sisters and daughters had walked blackrobed in the sun and the darkness of their sorrow had dimmed the light of day for her that she should suffer like loss had never come within the range of her imaginings the fieldglass of youth sees no cloud on the horizon of the future even when the eyes of youth are forced to recognize a present darkness in the exuberance of his feeling uncle zeke executed a pigeonwing with a lightsomeness not to be surpassed by the gayest youth in the quarters bravo uncle zeke bravo but why are you celebrating a victory for the south the north is fighting your battle the northern president has set you free no but if general lees army goes to washington it might happen that you would lose your opportunity to go i suppose the yoke is heavy in proportion to the remoteness of the possibility of shaking it off kate looked over to where the clog dancer was keeping vigorous time to the orchestra of banjo bones clapping hands and musical voices have you told them about the great news the old man lifted his clasped hands and looked upward with an expression of beatific happiness illuminating his face at that moment kate saw a sable youth leap the fence and run toward the quarters shouting some message the words of which she could not distinguish each reveler paused instantly in the attitude in which he chanced to be the clog dancer stood on one foot the other held in air as if executing the next step kate observed how graceful his lithe figure was in that pose old czsars bow was lifted in preparation for beginning a spirited and dashing strain the bones held by thomas jefferson monroe remained crossed at the exact musical angle george washington bonapartes hand was arrested on its downward flight toward the last note of juba dis en juba dat en juba roun de kittle er fat kate thought of the city that fell mute when the sleeping beauty sank into her long slumber the reaction came every figure bounded into activity the music rang out with a wild note of triumph that filled the night the bones rattled out their victorious message as if the joyful news had brought life again to them and clothed them with sentient flesh and given them a heart to thrill with triumph the clapping of hands resounded uproariously a chorus of voices rolled out in a jubilee and the wave of melody widened out over a sea that had no shore through the wild uproar of the plantation surged the solemn proud triumphant yet almost melancholy refrain of the bells the south is free the south is free thus the news came home faroff nations learned the fateful decision of that great conflict before accurate tidings of it could percolate through the stone wall which war had built around the south rumor was optimistic and the hope of a great victory swelled under her cheerful ministrations for a little moment the south felt the bliss of triumph then darkness fell jasper carrington lay half asleep on an army cot in the old covered wagon in which his faithful servant was taking his wounded master home the negro waving a fan gently to and fro over the white face glanced at jaspers cap under the drivers seat it had served as a fan until a thoughtful woman at the last stopping place had given them the palmleaf the gray cloth was faded and dusty the gold cord tarnished and frayed he took it up and turned it over in the crown was a strip of white silk discolored now on which was embroidered the owners name the old man could not read but he knew the meaning of the mysterious characters and that they were the work of kates dainty fingers colonel carrington moved restlessly have we passed the road to magnolia lawn yet pete the old man looked wistfully at his master yes but i cant stop like this pete no not like this you do as i tell you and goon to brightview the voice though weary had an unmistakable element of firmness and remember pete if we meet any one on the road not one word and dont you even dare show your black face we are just a team passing through the country thats all you understand and you promise me pete the old man groaned inwardly ha mussy every foot of the way was familiar to uncle pete he peered eagerly ahead past the drivers portly figure and saw two or three children in the bushes by the roadside only members of the household of magnolia lawn would be gathering berries on that stretch of road miles away from any other habitation his old heart gave a jump and with difficulty he suppressed a cry it was a chance a slim chance but the only one and he would take it he ceased fanning and closely watched the sleeper who did not stir as the wagon neared the children pete crept cautiously forward and picked up the gray cap then he took the large white handkerchief with which he had been wiping away the drops that occasionally broke out on the young mans face threw it over his head and leaned across the seat the children stood up dumb stolid to watch the wagon go by they did not move even when a mans cap hurled by a long arm from the front of the cart fell at the feet of the largest boy a few moments later pete whose face was still masked watching them from the rear of the cart saw them pick up the cap examine it with great excitement and shrill little cries and then set off with it at full speed up the lane to magnolia lawn there remained still a weary three hours drive colonel carrington slept fitfully and as they neared brightview restlessly insisted on sitting up we are almost there pete another turn there driver go in at this first gate petes bent frame straightened up and over his face spread a peculiar pallor his master too went even whiter than before neither spoke as the wagon bumped heavily over the illkept road beyond the burned trees stood the blackened frame the charred timbers of the old house one wing only standing the remaining twothirds of the structure leveled almost to the ground colonel carrington laid a hand affectionately on the wrinkled black one clinched on the side of the cot it is still home pete as long as there is a stone left still home pete turned pathetic eyes on his masters face i hope they have not heard was the reply when i left they went to my cousinsin nansemond the wing that remained contained but three rooms the long low sittingroom of hallowed memories and two small chambers above this part had been saved by the brave efforts of the loyal servants who had risked their lives to putout the flames when the destroyers had gone some of the old brightview servants came out with faces keen with curiosity which suddenly changed to alarm when they saw their master lying helpless on the cot then to delight when he called their names in a cheerful voice and assured them that he was not much hurt colonel carrington was carried slowly into the sittingroom and the cot put down gently near the west window where there was a faint breeze stirring here the desolation the tragedy seemed more awful still apparently the vandal sword had been ruthlessly swept to right and left in an attempt to destroy what could not be carried away the old cook had hurried off to get fresh milk and eggs for her marser joyous in the thought of having one of her wite folks again to serve jasper lay and looked about him an occasional groan escaping his lips troops of olden memories had followed him through the doorway and were gathering around his cot memories of olden homecomings when the old house stood stately and fair and gave him sweet welcome that gladdened his heart he remembered the last time he had come home when mother and sister had met him with loving caresses and the one girl in all the world had taken a wild night ride to warn him of danger old pete bustled about making a great deal of fuss over getting things comfortable for it would never do to let the young master see that he too could have laid himself down and groaned in anguish of spirit presently after he had been given some hot milk he called out wistfully i thought i heard horses pete i wish i could see the road from here oh it would be so good to catch a glimpse of some of the home people wouldnt it suddenly for a second there appeared in the doorway a girlish figure in a riding habit finger on lip the other hand beckoning the girl receded into the shadows pete nodded and then went to jaspers side the young man lay looking out of the window he went out and drew the door to behind him kate and her father stood on the veranda the girl nervously plaiting into folds the soft felt hat she had worn uncle zeke was in the shadows beyond at his feet a big basket and a bundle of bedding so you have brought your young master home uncle pete i hope he is not badly wounded said the colonel ts he much hurt he isnt going to die is he uncle pete really uncle pete you wouldnt deceive me would you i must see him this minute i cant wait i wont startle him well you go in and keep him from getting up and father and i will just come in slowly and let him see us the old man turned as he was about to open the door and said you better let yo pa stay outside honey en come in by yosef firs uncle pete entered the sittingroom did you find anything pete oh i wish i could get up the old man chuckled as he spread over jasper with an almost womanly touch a lavenderscented sheet from a chest saved by the servants from the flames then he went around to the other side of the cot and stood before him shutting out the view of the door no whats that i thought i heard a footstep the sick man started uncle pete moved away kate kate my darling my darling am i dreaming out of the shadow she came into the golden radiance that shone from the west her face was white with tense emotion and her dark eyes were aglow the wondrous picture held him motionless and silent as the realization of her presence dawned upon him she came into the sunset glory and knelt beside the cot his arms were around her and his lips in the windblown tangle of her hair pete tiptoed out a suspicious moisture in his eyes kate my sweetheart my love how did you know how did you come here little girl little girl dont cry so im all right all right the wonder of it all filled his heart again and he said how did you know one of the boys brought me a cap with the very strip of silk on which i had embroidered your name saying that it had been thrown from a wagon that went down the lane by a negro with something white over his face he said that there was a dead soldier lying in the wagon i knew that uncle pete had brought you home and we came at once that old rascal pete said jasper with a smile of content half an hour later pete tiptoed back kate sat in the window her eyes shining jasper held her hands and his gaze did not leave her face you must tell me what you need uncle pete said kate everything you havent got and you shall have it the first thing in the morning or tonight if need be uncle zeke and i must be going in a few minutes father will remain with jasper dear heart i shall be back in the morning and bring doctor gorham just to make sure you are so thoughtful uncle pete and just to think of your bringing him home by yourself where is my cousin garnett but i suppose he couldnt get leave your master tells me you saw him last going down the road a glow of love and reverence lit jaspers eyes as he said that is our generals loving spirit always around us to aid and bless you can never know what general pickett has been to me a strong arm to support a steady hand to guide a wise head to counsel a gentle heart to sympathize in joy and sorrow an inspiration on march and field he is a living force to give his men the power to endure and achieve the hottest place in the battle is where he is seen leading his division and there is not a man of us who would not proudly follow him to death kate pressed his hand silent with the deep feeling that surged through her heart then she turned to the window i must go now the sun has set she said softly but not for us nor for the south for all of us a grand a glorious sunrise and a perfect day jasper dear yes sweetheart mine a new home anew south but the old old love the gray dusk closed about them pete had crept away into the shadows and through the twilight came the clear sweet sound of kates buglecall
