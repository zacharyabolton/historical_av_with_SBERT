to the brave soldier an officer in picketts division whose sword never swerved from duty the dear kinsman whose life has made light in my own the loyal friend of many years of sunshine and of cloud the true heart that spends itself for the uplifting of humanity the noble mind that keeps the purity of the springtime with the wisdom of autumn col j j phillips this volume is dedicated my way led through an opening in the woods that looked as if the trees had drawn graciously aside to leave a glade for the fairies to dance in on midsummer night as they stood in dignified poise looking down into the little glen the sun crept between their branches and lay in golden glints upon the green sward i felt as if no foot but mine and the fairies had ever touched the soft grass at a little distance the river rippled melodiously to the sea its plaintive cadence floated to me faintly mingled with the music of the windblown leaves through a parting in the woods i saw the gliding waves suncrowned by the glow of the perfect june day i seemed to look into a sunlit silver world stretching endlessly beyond the rim of earth own nature and i were alone and at one the heart of summer beat against my the invisible intangible life of the forest made a dreamful chiming of fairy bells around me a woodflower nestled against a cushion of moss at the foot of a great oak its pale pink petals half hidden in the velvety green i passed on through the dell with soft and reverent tread as one through a parting in the woods i saw the gliding waves suncrowned by the glow of the perfect june day who crosses the inner court of a sacred temple beyond the glade a serpentine walk threaded an amphitheatre of cedars and wound up a green slope on which stood a little church in front of the church an old negro was industriously pulling a rope made of grapevines keeping time with his swaying body and bald uncovered head to the strange sweet melody which his bony brawny tugging hands were making to chime from the big church bell this bell however was not suspended from the church but from an old oak tree a few yards away for the steeples of virginia churches were designed not for utility but for ornament tradition says the steeple of this particular church which bore the kings coatofarms was on the day of the declaration of independence rent lengthwise by lightning and the insignia of royalty hurled to the earth the church was a quaint old structure a preserved relic of ages gone by with its youths companion the ever faithful ivy climbing and twining in more and more luxurious love around its ruins gray as it and the years had grown a beautiful spring gushed from the rocks a few feet from the stone steps which led up to the vestibule and flowed in a large clear crystal stream underneath the church odoriferous plants and blooms regaled the open air with their fragrance the clacking of a distant mill was heard and from a large weeping willow tree whose trunk was encircled by flowers of a purple hue a mockingbird warbled sweetly the sounds of the echoing wedding bells among the buttercups and glistening leaves of the virginia creeper a snake had thrown her enameled skin a copse of treesoak cedar magnolia aspen and one juniperbee gum blessed and protected the church and grounds from the summers sun the drone of bees came from a crotch in the juniper which crotch for time past had been the fatherland of the bees of all the surrounding country for from it every season the old father and kingbee drove swarm after swarm of his progeny out into the world to make new honey and new homes for themselves and from this ancestral home by the way must have come that brown glistening knotty crawling cluster which i had just seen settling guiltless of any intended disrespect upon the surmounting of the kings coatofarms among the growing leaves on the ledge of an ancient monument as i had passed along on my way to the church the monument in question was of black marble and was six feet long and three feet wide i stopped to read the epitaph i saw engraved thereon but finding the tombstone was thus occupied i hesitated the bees however seemed intuitively to understand that i not only meant them no harm but was taking every care not to disturb maybe his objection to churches was that he did not want to live the kind of life of which churches approve there is a commandment against murder and your captain killed people what do you suppose made the captain first think about freeing the slaves it was no more his business than it was any other mans affair and he lived up there wasnt that a dangerous place for him do you think the captain was right if a free person advise or conspire with a slave to rebel or make insurrection or with any person to induce a slave to rebel or make insurrection he shall be punished with death whether such rebellion or insurrection be made or not the laws of the state authorized immediate execution of the death sentence in cases of insurrection or rebellion by the law john brown could have been tried convicted and executed all on the same day he was charged with conspiracy with slaves for the purpose of insurrection treason against the commonwealth of virginia murder in the first degree his counsel mr george henry hoyt of massachusetts plead for him and john brown declared he was too ill to go to court the governor of virginia after his visit to him in prison said they themselves are mistaken who take him to be a madman he is a bundle of the best nerves i ever saw cut and thrust and bleeding and in bonds he is a man of clear head of courage fortitude simple ingenuousness the gamest man i ever sawing cherry tree rocking herself to and fro in a greenpainted flag chair was an old whitehaired negress granny elizabeth she was holding on her lap a little colored baby in her left hand she had a freshly broken branch of aspen leaves which she waved back and forth over the little black body dressed all in immaculate white keeping time with the fluttering leaves to the old ship of zion as she brushed away the swarming flies a yellow fice dog taking advantage of the churners absence and of our company was sneakingly licking from the sides of the churn the cream which had been splashed out by the too energetic churning another broken branch of the quivering aspen tree was lying on the ground with its green and silver leaves fringed with cream bearing selfevident proof of having been used to shoo away the epicurean flies while the dasher was cheerily moved up and down making music to the churners threatening and anon pleading song of come butter come good morning granny how are you all i hope your little baby is not sick said my husband with his irresistible cordiality handing me the reins and bounding gracefully out of the wagon and over the stile and holding out his princely hand i am very sorry granny elizabeth for your grief tempered though it is with freedom said my husband in kindly sympathy again extending his hand i in my anxiety for my own little ones gave expression only to fear and caution drawing back into the wagon instead of getting out asking with almost indecent haste what the matter was with the baby ahm groaned granny elizabeth in reply mournfully waving her bluechecked turbaned head to and fro the tragical impress of the calamitous enormity of the disease attuning her voice she continued deed en deed marse jawge she said interrupting herself and changing her tone and manner as she suddenly recollected the duties and hospitalities of her home calling vigorously but in vain for mandys assistance the old woman seemingly forgot all her sorrows in the dispensing of hospitalities meantime my husband had let down to the bottom of the well by the well pole hand over hand the old oaken bucket which was securely tied to the end of the pole with a grapevine and drawing it up dripping full had set it on the wellcurb while he washed out the longnecked countrygrown gourd to give us a cool drink where is little sammys mother i asked when the thirsty children had drunk and been induced though reluctantly to go ahead with their mammy lured after no little effort on the part of both of us to go and hunt the temptinglydescribed bluebells and crimson and white velvet oak balls for the dead baby the fice dog and the hidden mandy all had a mysterious fascination for these little ones impressionable as they were where is uncle ege granny i hope he is still living said my husband as granny elizabeth paused knitting her wrinkled brow till it looked like an empty waterbag and snapping her lips together so suddenly that her nose and chin came into collision and slipped past each other in the intensity of her emotions she answered here is some money to help pay for the little ones coffin when it comes we must move on now granny so goodbye tanky tanky marse jawge tanky honey she said getting up and making a courtesy with the little dead baby in her arms we said goodbye and drove off calling and taking in the little children who had gone on ahead their chattering voices describing the cones and flowers they had not had time to gather drowned the last notes of the quavering old voice as it twanged through the trees youth has always its famed historian teller of unswerving truth to whose judicial mind all disputed points of history are submitted for decision uncle washington skutchins was the encyclopdia of our childhood his many occupations of barber assistant undertaker measurer of ditches wells and cordwood had brought him into close contact with people of information and his absorbent mind gleaned from each new field wax to receive yet marble to retain it never lost a fact or a principle that had once been impressed upon it so accurate were eye memory and speech that his measurements were admitted as undisputed evidence in court and his statements in regard to past events were of academic authority to us who had just entered on the pathway of knowledge he was the court of last resort on historic subjects not even peter parley commanded our confidence when he failed to coincide with uncle washington skutch ins as for ordinary historians popularly accepted by schools and libraries they could not stand a moment against uncle washingtons disapproval uncle washington hear what my book says he would listen attentively and after a pause of solemn significance would say now listen to this after close attention to the story he would shake his head with decision then the whole passage would be crossed out and the story according to uncle washington inserted in a footnote and we would feel sure that the eternal verities of history were ours we had no faith in any historical records that did not bear upon their title page that seal of authenticityrevised by uncle washington skutch ins we used to ask him about the great men whom he had known and to us they became veritable living figures in the panorama of our existence in which patrick henry made his celebrated speech in the parsons case uncle washington carefully distinguished between linguistic suppleness and mere learning holding that while they might be associated in the same mind they were by no means necessarily to be found in conjunction as an illustration of the utter helplessness of scholastic ability and legal acumen if they have that and i had not given them one shilling they would be rich and if they have not that and i had given them the whole world they would be poor when competing with simple tongue suppleness he was wont to relate the manner in which dick a groom of his acquaintance got the better of his master no less a personage than chief justice marshall the home of the chief justice in richmond was opposite that of colonel pickett the grandfather of general george e pickett the colonel was a man of great wealth and distinguished as a wit he and his judicial neighbor were opposite in many ways especially in the matter of physique the gaunt form and meagre face of the chief justice seemed to indicate that in addition to having descended through a line of thin ancestry he had lived a life of toil and of abstemious habits the colonel on the other hand showed in his portly form and genial face the effects of generous living and years spent in scholarly leisure the same difference was apparent in every part of their establishments even including the carriage horses the lean animals which drew the coach of the chief justice showing a painful contrast to the sleek well rounded handsome steeds of the colonel so noticeable was this dissimilarity that it led to unpleasant suspicions that dick was neglecting the judges horses perhaps even converting the supplies provided for them into liquid refreshments for himself the attention of the judge having been called to the subject he sent for dick to report to him at once with the intention of solving the new problem which defied constitutional principles and court precedents good morning dick returned the judge sharply with an air of suspicion and disapproval most unusual to him perceiving to his astonishment that the moral atmosphere was thus perturbed dick chose to refer the unpleasant condition to some other cause than dissatisfaction with himself dick interrupted the judge rather impatiently what is the reason that colonel picketts horses are so fat and sleek while mine look almost like skeletons dick my horses are neglected they are evidently not being properly cared for i dont believe they are half fed or half curried this attack from the judge was so unexpected that dick was fairly posed he hemmed and hawed for awhile till he had gathered up his negro wits or as uncle washington skutchins would have said had found his supple tongue thats so dick thats so i never thought of that said the judge reflectively thats so no said the judge decidedly not no mrs marshall is most certainly not fat no dick you are about as lean as a beanpole yes dick yes your evidence is conclusive it is quite apparent that my judgment in the premises was erroneous from which the word skedaddle is supposed to have been derived
