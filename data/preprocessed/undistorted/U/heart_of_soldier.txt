several weeks ago i wrote quite a long letter from faraway san francisco to a very dear little girl and told her that a certain soldier who wears one of her long silken ringlets next his heart was homeward bound and that he hoped a line of welcome would meet him on his arrival in his native state he told her of the difficulties he had experienced in being relieved from his post of how sorry he was to sheathe the sword which had helped to bring victory to the country for which he had fought and how sorry he was to say goodby to his little command and to part from his faithful and closest companion his dog and his many dear friends but sorrier still for the existing circumstances which made this severance necessary he told her many things for which with him she will be sorry and some of which he hopes will make her glad he is troubled by finding no answer to this long letter which having at that time no notion of the real conditions here he is afraid was written too freely by far no my child i had no conception of the intensity of feeling the bitterness and hatred toward those who were so lately our friends and are now our enemies i of course have always strenuously opposed disunion not as doubting the right of secession which was taught in our textbook at west point but as gravely questioning its expediency i believed that the revolutionary spirit which infected both north and south was but a passing phase of fanaticism which would perish under the rebuke of all good citizens who would surely unite in upholding the constitution but when that great assembly composed of ministers lawyers judges chancellors statesmen mostly white haired men of thought met in south carolina and when their districts were called crept noiselessly to the table in the center of the room and affixed their signatures to the parchment on which the ordinance of secession was inscribed and when in deathly silence spite of the gathered multitude general jamison arose and without preamble read the ordinance of secession has been signed and ratified i proclaim the state oi south carolina an independent sovereignty and lastly when my old boyhoods friend called for an invasion it was evident that both the advocates and opponents of secession had read the portents aright you know my little lady some of those crossstitched mottoes on the cardboard samplers which used to hang on my nursery wall such as he who provides not for his own household is worse than an infidel and charity begins at home made a lasting impression upon me and while i love my neighbor i e my country i love my household i e my state more and i could not be an infidel and lift my sword against my own kith and kin even though i do believe my most wise little counselor and confidante that the measure of american greatness can be achieved only under one flag and i fear alas there can never again reign for either of us the true spirit of national unity whether divided under two flags or united under one we did not tarry even for a day in frisco but under assumed names my friend sam barron and i sailed for new york where we arrived on the very day that sams father commodore barron was brought there a prisoner which fact was proclaimed aloud by the pilot amid cheers of the passengers and upon our landing heralded by the newsboys with more cheers poor sam had a hard fight to hide his feelings and to avoid arrest we separated as mere ship acquaintances and went by different routes to meet again as arranged at the house of doctor paxton a southern sympathizer and our friend on the next day we left for canada by the earliest train thence we made our perilous way back south again barely escaping arrest several times and finally arrived in dear old richmond september 13th just four days ago i at once enlisted in the army and the following day was commissioned captain but so bitter is the feeling here that my being unavoidably delayed so long in avowing my allegiance to my state has been most cruelly and severely criticized by friends yes and even relatives too now little one if you had the very faintest idea how happy a certain captain in the c sa my but that c looks queer would be to look into your beautiful soulspeaking eyes and hear your wonderfully musical voice i think you would let him know by wire where he could find you i shall almost listen for the electricity which says i am at come i know that you will have mercy on your devoted soldier your welcome note gladdened my drooping spirits last evening how can i thank you for the token i shall always cherish it my darling i sent a short note to you via petersburg to wakefield i sincerely trust you received it as in it i advised you not to come down into this part of the country the yankees are burning everything they can reach and god only knows what excesses they may commit on the defenseless should they have the power so much troubled am i about you that i send this by a courier of my own that he may deliver it to you in person how i wish i were the courier im afraid you will only expose yourself needlessly to 1 a wreath and stars which she had embroidered for his collar harm i dont know when i shall see you but i should be nearly as far from you as at present at any rate i should be worse than miserable did i know you were so near these now apparently infuriated beings alas my darling as the indian says when despondent my heart is on the ground the enemy has been strongly reenforced and the town is one network of batteries and entrenchments i have had two little brushes with them running them into their works both times the first one yesterday week i was ordered to make a reconnaissance in force which was done by a part of armisteads brigade and in so doing we got under a concentrated fire of about sixteen guns and had as jolly a little time of it for about fifteen minutes as i ever saw parrot and round shot were about as thick as the ticks are and their name is legion however the object was effected and we have lost altogether only about seventyfive men from my division havent you some relatives living this side of the blackwater a captain phillips of the 3rd write me my dearest two long weary weeks since i drank comfort from those bright eyes to me a year of anxiety your devoted and miserable soldier my heart beat with joy this morning when captain peacock returned to camp bringing me your beautiful letter beautiful because it was the echo of a pure spirit and a radiant soul i am humbly grateful my little girl for this loyal devotion which you give me your soldier let us pray to our dear heavenly father to spare us to each other and give us strength to bear cheerfully this enforced separation i know that it cannot be long and that sooner or later our flag will float over the seas of the world for our cause is right and just why my sally all that we ask is a separation from people of contending interests who love us as a nation as little as we love them the dissolution of a union which has lost its holiness to be let alone and permitted to sit under our own vine and fig tree and eat our figs peeled and dried or fresh or pickled just as we choose the enemy is our enemy because he neither knows nor understands us and yet will not let us part in peace and be neighbors but insists on fighting us to make us one with him forgetting that both slavery and secession were his own institutions the north is fighting for the union and we for home and fireside all the men i know and love in the world comrades and friends both north and south are exposed to hardships and dangers and are fighting on one side or the other and each for that which he knows to be right speaking of fighting captain peacock this morning brings us the news that the daring fearless has again won shall i say a victory no not victory victory is such a glorious triumphant word i cannot use it in speaking of warfare that is illegal to many of us marse roberts approval and commendation of this illegitimate mode is a source of surprise for like many of us the dear old 1 general lee tyee was reared and schooled in honorable warfare well as trenholm said only those who have enlisted for this whole war with muskets on their shoulders and knapsacks on their backs have a right to criticize but i reserve even from these the right and acknowledge myself wrong in criticizing an old army story though hardly illustrative enough to be justifiable in telling occurs to me an old major of artillery who was always deploring the fact that he couldnt use his own favorite arm against the indians determined one day to try the moral effect of it upon a tribe of friendly ones nearby so he took one of the small howitzers which defended the fort and securely strapped it to the back of an army mule with the muzzle projecting over the mules tail and then proceeded with the captain sergeant and orderly to the bluff on the bank of the missouri where the indians were encamped the gun was loaded and primed the fuse inserted and the mule backed to the very edge of the bluff the mule with his wonted curiosity hearing the fizzing turned his head to see what unusual thing was happening to him the next second his feet were bunched up together making forty revolutions a minute the gun threatening with instant destruction everything within a radius of five miles the captain climbed a tree the sergeant and orderly following suit the fat major too heavy to climb rolled over on the ground alternately praying to god and cursing the mule when the explosion came the recoil of the gun and the wild leap of the terrified mule carried both over the bluff and to the bottom of the river the captain the sergeant and the poor crestfallen discomfited major with the mule and the gun to account for returned to the fort soon to be waited on by the indian chiefs who had held a hurried council the high chief bowing his head up and down said injun go home injun ver brave injun love white man injun help white man in jun heap use gun use knife heap use bow arrow but when white man shoot off whole jackass injun no think right no can understand injun no help white man fight that way injun go home so my sally if you will forgive your soldier for telling this oldtime story and let him say that he does not approve of fighting in the way in which fights he will bid you goodby and eat his breakfast which the cook says is getting cold will you come my darling and have some coffee with your soldier it is some we captured and is real coffee come the tin cup is clean and shining but the cornbread is greasy and smoked and the bacon that is greasy too but it is good and tastes all right if it will only holdout till our stars and bars wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave and we have our own home nevermore well hear of wars but only love and life with its eternal joys your own soldier a violent storm was raging flooding the level ground as i wrote you last followed the next day by one of fire and blood the battle of seven pines i pray that you accepted the invitation of your mountain chum and that your beautiful eyes and tender heart have been spared the horrors of war which this battle must have poured into sad richmond three hundred and fifty of your soldiers brigade 1700 strong were killed or wounded and all fought as virginians should fighting as they did for the right for love honor home and state principles which they had been taught from the mothers knees the schoolroom and the pulpit under orders from old peter we marched at daylight and reported to d h hill near seven pines hill directed me to ride over and communicate with hood i started at once with charlie and archer of my staff to obey this order but had gone only a short distance when we met a part of the louisiana zouaves in panic i managed to seize and detain one fellow mounted on a mule that seemed to have imbibed his riders fear and haste the man dropped his plunder and seizing his carbine threatened to kill me unless i released him at once saying that the yankees were upon his heels we galloped back to hills headquarters archer bringing up the rear with the zouave who explained that the enemy were advancing in force and were within a few hundred yards of us hill ordered me to attack at once which i did driving them through an abatis over a crossroad leading to the railroad as we were nearing the second abatis i on foot at the time noticed that armisteads brigade had broken and sent a courier back posthaste to hill for troops a second and third message were sent and then a fourth telling him that if he would send me more troops and ammunition we could drive the enemy across the chickahominy but alas hill as brave as great as heroic a soldier as he is has since the fall of johnston been so bothered and annoyed with countermanding orders that he was if i may say so confused and failed to respond after this delay nothing was left for us but to withdraw hill sent two regiments of colstons brigade and ordered mahones brigade on my right and at one oclock at night under his orders we withdrew in perfect order and the enemy retreated to their bosky cover thus my darling was ended the battle of seven pines no shot was fired afterward how i wish i could say it ended all battles and that the last shot that will ever be heard was fired on june first 1862 what a change love does make how tender all things become to a heart touched by love how beautiful the beautiful is and how abhorrent is evil see my darling see what power you have guard it well i have heard that my dear old friend mcclellan is lying ill about ten miles from here may some loving soothing hand minister to him he was he is and he will always be even were his pistol pointed at my heart my dear loved friend may god bless him and spare his life you my darling may not be in sympathy with this feeling for i know you see no good in nazareth forgive me for feeling differently from you little one and please dont love me any the less you cannot understand the entente cordiale between us old fellows faithfully your soldier all last night my darling sally the spirit of my dear mother seemed to hover over me when she was living and i used to feel in that way i always as sure as fate received from her a letter written at the very time that i had the sensation of her presence i wonder if up there she is watching over me trying to send me some message some warning i wish i knew this morning my brigade moved from its cantonments on the williamsburg road and by daybreak was marching along the mechan icsville turnpike leading north of richmond the destination and character of the expedition my darling is unknown but the position of other troops indicates a general movement this evening we crossed the chickahominy and are bivouacked on our guns in the road in front of mechanicsville from which point i am blessing my spirit and refreshing my soul by sending a message to my promised wife i am tired and sleepy several times today going to sleep on my horse this war was really never contemplated in earnest i believe if either the north or the south had expected that their differences would result in this obstinate struggle the coldblooded puritan and the cock hatted huguenot and cavalier would have made a compromise poor old virginia came oftener than noahs dove with her olive branch though she desired to be loyal to the union of states she did not believe in the right of coercion and when called upon to furnish troops to restrain her sister states she refused and would not even permit the passage of an armed force through her domain for that purpose with no thought of cost she rolled up her sleeves ready to risk all in defense of a principle consecrated by the blood of her fathers and now alas it is too late we must carry through this bitter task unto the end may the end be soon your soldier it is only when you are here with me my darling that i ani not chafing fretting under my enforced absence from my command as poor a marksman as the yankee was who shot me i wish he had been poorer still aiming as he must have been either at my head or my heart and breaking my wing he was frightened too i suspect and had besides too much powder in his load what did you want with that shotsmoked burnt coat sleeve the arm it held is yours to work for and shield you my love for always impatient and restive as i am to get back to the field letters and reports just received show me that i am not missed and that my gallant old brigade is proving its valor as loyally under its new leader as when it so fearlessly followed your soldier it held waterloo bridge against pope while jackson crossed the rappahannock and on the afternoon of the 30th received and repelled the onset of fitz john porter magnificently clearing the field and winning a victory for our arms the news came too this morning of the death of kearny one of the most brilliant generals of the federal army a man whose fame as a soldier is worldwide i knew him first in mexico where as you know he lost an arm at the siege of mexico city in algeria he won the cross of the legion of honor he fought with the french in the battles of magenta and solferino and received also from napoleon third the decoration of the legion of honor i wish we had taken him prisoner instead of shooting him i hate to have such a man as kearny killed marse robert who was his old friend sent his body to pope under a flag of truce i am glad he did that poor old kearny the same courier brought the sad news that our ewell had lost a leg and our talliaferro had been wounded and these are the horrors to which when away from you my beautiful darling your soldier is impatient to return never never did men since the world began fight like ours the duke of somerset who sneeringly laughed when he saw our ragged dirty barefooted soldiers mostly beardless boys as he said took off his hat in reverence when he saw them fight lovingly your soldier how i shall miss your visit today my darling i wish you had not gone dont stay doctor minnegerode asked me this morning when he called who sent the beautiful flowers the dear old doctor understood he winked at me and changed the subject he is as loyal to the south dear old fellow as if his ancestors had landed at jamestown when he asked after my wound he said he would like to pray with me though the dear old man pronounced it with his german accent bray and that reminded me of a story and instead of having my thoughts and my heart set upon his beautiful prayer as i should have miserable sinner that i was i began thinking of tom august vho said that one sunday someone meeting him coming out of old st pauls asked him vhat was the matter he replied oh nothing im not a jackass and im not going to bray and old doctor minnegerode not only insists that i but that his whole congregation shall bray i for one will not do it and i dont want to make a row about it so i came out i wonder what the effect would be if we took him literally and didairbray now my darling forgive this foolish story i learned to like storytelling listening as a boy to the best storyteller in the world mr lincoln even the bird knows you are not coming today for he doesnt sing i shall hold you to the last line of your sweet note which says ill come to you my soldier before the flowers die when bob asked me is miss sallie comin dis ebenin er in de mornin i answered she does not mention any set time bob she only says shell come before the flowers die de flowers aint waxinated flowers is dey marse george he asked den if dey aint waxinated twont be long fo she is here when i asked him to hold the paper while i wrote he humbly beseechingly asked please suh marse george ef hit aint axin too much when you comes ter writin er dem dar words lak love en honey en darlin er any er dem poetry rhymes bout roses red en violets blue wont you please suh show em ter me i didnt promise him my sweetheart i only said hold that paper steady sir and dont let it slip but when i did call you darling or tell you i loved you i felt so guilty that the rascal knew it and grinned your own darling my heart turns to you with a love so great that pain follows in its wake you cannot understand this my beautiful brighteyed sunnyhearted princess your face is the sweetest face in all the world mirroring as it does all that is pure and unselfish and i must not cast a shadow over it by the fears that come to me in spite of myself no a soldier should not know fear of any kind i must fight and plan and hope and you must pray pray for a realization of all our beautiful dreams sitting beside our own hearthstone in our own home you and i you my goddess of devotion and i your devoted slave may god in his mercy spare my life and make it worthy of you my shoulder and arm are still quite stiff and i cannot yet put my sleeve on the wounded arm i have on one sleeve and my coat is thrown over my other shoulder and other arm i can reach my mouth with my hand by bending my neck way over so i am not helpless bob still buttons my collar and does some other little services until i have more control of my arm however i shall confine myself to riding old black and not venture on lucy enough of so small a matter my boys are delighted to welcome me back showing their affection for me in many many ways garnett is still in command of my dear old brigade which was temporarily turned over to him when i was wounded and which under his gallant leadership has sustained its old reputation for fearlessness and endurance i miss dear familiar faces for many of the brave fellows have been killed and wounded you have heard me speak of colonel strange a gallant soldier he was wounded and left behind after he was shot the plucky old chap called out in a loud clear voice stand firm boys stand firm well the yankees won the battle but mcclellans delay in winning enabled old jack to seize harpers ferry so it was not so great a victory for them after all old jacks note to marse robert telling him of his success was characteristic in both brevity and diction he said through gods mercy harpers ferry and its garrison are to be surrendered the seventeenth following is recorded in letters of blood for both armies and in its wake came lincolns great political victory proving the might of the pen in his emancipation proclamation winning with it the greatest victory yet for the north it will behoove us now to heed well the old story of the lark and the husbandman for it will be farewell to all foreign intervention unless greek meets greek and we fight fire with fire and we too issue an emancipation proclamation i pray god that the powers that reign will have the wisdom and foresight to see this in its true and allpervading light it would end the war and i should assume as soon as practicable the role of schoolmaster and husband to the brightest little pupil and the sweetest little wife in all the world your soldier p s have been placed temporarily in command of a division today i was officially promoted to the rank of majorgeneral and permanently placed in command of a division my dear old brigade which i love and which was with me in the battles of williamsburg seven pines and gainess mill was assigned to general garnett and there comes somehow in spite of everything a little kind of curious feeling within when i hear it called garnetts brigade even though he has been in command of it almost ever since i was wounded and has won for it distinction and from it love and respect old dick is a fine fellow a brave splendid soldier he was in the mexican war and was wounded in the battle of mexico he commanded a brigade under old jack and was for a time in command of the famous old stonewall brigade you have not met him my sweetheart but i want you to know him he is as sensitive and proud as he is fearless and sweetspirited and has felt more keenly than most men would old jacks censure of him at the battle of kernstown when all his ammunition gave out and he withdrew his brigade from the field for which old jack had him arrested and relieved from duty old jack told lawton that in arresting garnett he had no reference to his want of daring which was surprising for old jack to say who never explains anything lawton who is one of his generals says old jack holds himself as the god of war giving short sharp commands distinctly rapidly and decisively without consultation or explanation and disregarding suggestions and remonstrances being himself absolutely fearless and having unusual mental and moral as well as physical courage he goes ahead on his own hook asking no advice and resenting interference he places no value on human life caring for nothing so much as fighting unless it be praying illness wounds and all disabilities he defines as inefficiency and indications of a lack of patriotism suffering from insomnia he often uses his men as a sedative and when he cant sleep calls them out marches them out a few miles then marches them back he never praises his men for gallantry because it is their duty to be gallant and they do not deserve credit for doing their duty well my own darling i only pray that god may spare him to us to see us through if general lee had grants resources he would soon end the war but old jack can do it without resources bless your heart here i am talking of these old warhorses to my flower queen well she knows how entirely i love her and how i have left in her keeping my souls all lovingly and faithfully your soldier here we are my darling at fredericksburg on the south side of the rappahan nock halfway between richmond and washington fortified for us by the hand of the great father i penciled you a note by old jackerie on the 12th from the foot of the hills between hazel run and the telegraph road in it i sent a hyacinth given me by a pretty lady who came out with beaten biscuit and some unwritten and written messages from old peter and old jack hood ewell stuart and your brothers to the someone to whom i was writing my division nine thousand strong is in fine shape it was on the field of battle as a division for the first time yesterday though only one brigade kempers was actively engaged what a day it was my darling this ever to be remembered by many of us thirteenth of december dawning auspiciously upon us clad in deepest darkest mourning a fog such as would shame london lay over the valley and through the dense mist distinctly came the uncanny commands of the unseen opposing officers my men were eager to be in the midst of the fight and if hood had not been so cautious they would probably have immortalized themselves old peters orders were that hood and myself were to hold our ground of defense unless we should see an opportunity to attack the enemy while engaged with a p hill on the right a little after ten when the fog had lifted and stuarts cannon from the plain of massaponax were turned upon meade and when franklins advance left the enemys flank open i went up to hood and urged him to seize the opportunity but he was afraid to assume so great a responsibility and sent for permission to old peter who was with marse robert in a different part of the field before his assent and approval were received the opportunity alas was lost if war my darling is a necessity and i suppose it is it is a very cruel one your soldiers heart almost stood still as he watched those sons of erin fearlessly rush to their death the brilliant assault on maryes heights of their irish brigade was beyond description why my darling we forgot they were fighting us and cheer after cheer at their fearlessness went up all along our lines about fifty of my division sleep their last sleep at the foot of maryes heights i cant help feeling sorry for old burnside proud plucky hardheaded old dog i always liked him but i loved little mac and it was a godsend to the confederacy that he was relieved oh my darling war and its results did not seem so awful till the love for you came now now i want to love and bless and help everything and there are no foes no enemies just love for you and longing for you your soldier today i rode on ahead of my division stopped for a moment at our old home ran into the garden and gathered for my darling some lilies of the valley planted by my sweet mother which i knew were now in the full glory of their blossoming as i plucked them one by one i thought of the dear mother who had planted them and the sweet bride tobe who would receive them and my heart went up in gratitude for the great love given me by both while i am writing to you braxton and the cook and the whole household in fact are busy getting a lunch for me and preparing to load up my courier and my boy bob with as many more lunches as they can carry to be distributed as far as they will go my little sister is making a paper box to hold my lilies for you and i am writing a loveletter to stand sentinel over them and guard the sweet sacred messages entrusted to them old jackerie will take them to you and will also bring you with my sisters love a box of her own homemade dulces perhaps sweetheart perhaps i say you will see your soldier sooner than you think you know that since the capture of roanoke island and our abandonment of norfolk and suffolk all that section of the country has been in the hands of the enemy now in the extreme northeast corner of north carolina are stored away large quantities of corn and bacon old peter our farseeing slow but sure indefatigable plodding old warhorse has planned to secure some of these sorely needed supplies for our poor half fed army and there never was such an army such an uncomplaining plucky body of men never why my darling during these continuous ten days march the ground snowy and sleety the feet of many of these soldiers covered only with improvised moccasins of raw beef hide and hundreds of them without shoes or blankets or overcoats they have not uttered one word of complaint nor one murmuring tone but cheerily singing or telling stories they have tramped tramped tramped to crown it all after having marched sixty miles over half frozen slushy roads they passed today through richmond the home of many of them without a halt with not a straggler greeted and cheered by sweethearts wives mothers and friends god bless you my darling god bless you my son hello old man howdy charley rang all along the line lunches slices of bread and meat bottles of milk or hot coffee were thrust into grateful hands by the dear people of richmond who thus brought comfort and cheer to many a hungry one besides their very own as the men hurriedly returned the greetings and marched on you would hardly recognize these ragged barefoot soldiers as the trim tidy boys of two years ago in their handsome gray uniforms with shining equipment and full haversacks and knapsacks be brave and help me to be brave my darling and to trust in god i wont say keep your powder dry for one who doesnt know enough to do that is not much of a soldier faithfully and forever your soldier this morning i awakened from a beautiful dream and while its glory still overshadows the waking and fills my soul with radiance i write to make an earnest request entreating praying that you will grant it you know my darling we have no prophets in these days to tell us how near or how far is the end of this awful struggle if the battle is not to the strong then we may win but when all our ports are closed and the world is against us when for us a man killed is a man lost while grant may have twentyfive of every nation to replace one of his it seems that the battle is to the strong so often already has hope been dashed to the winds why dear only a little while since the army of the potomac recrossed the rappahannock defeated broken in spirit the men deserting the subordinate officers so severe in their criticism of their superiors that the great commanderinchief of the army mr lincoln felt it incumbent upon him to write a severe letter of censure and rebuke note the change and hear their buglecall of hope hooker who is alleged to have the finest army on the planet is reported to be on the eve of moving against richmond my division and that of hood together with the artillery of bearing and henry have been ordered to a point near petersburg to meet this possible movement now my darling may angels guide my pen and help me to write help me to voice this longing desire of my heart and intercede for me with you for a speedy fulfillment of your promise to be my wife as you know it is imperative that i should remain at my post and absolutely impossible for me to come for you so you will have to come to me will you dear will you come cant your beautiful eyes see beyond the mist of my eagerness and anxiety that in the bewilderment of my worship worshiping as i do one so divinely right and feeling that my love is returned how hard it is for me to ask you to overlook oldtime customs remembering only that you are to be a soldiers wife a week a day an hour as your husband would engulf in its great joy all my past woes and ameliorate all future fears so my sally dont lets wait send me a line back by jackerie saying you will come come at once my darling into this valley of the shadow of uncertainty and make certain the comfort that if i should fall i shall fall as your husband you know that i love you with a devotion that absorbs all else a devotion so divine that when in dreams i see you it is as something too pure and sacred for mortal touch and if you only knew the heavenly life which thrills me through when i make it real to myself that you love me you would understand think my dear little one of the uncertainty and dangers of even a day of separation and dont let the time come when either of us will look back and say it might have been if i am spared my dear all my life shall be devoted to making you happy to keeping all that would hurt you far from you to making all that is good come near to you heaven will help me to be ever helpful to you and will bless me to bless you if you knew how every hour i kneel at your altar if you could hear the prayers i offer to you and to our heavenly father for you if you knew the incessant thought and longing and desire to make you blessed you would know how much your answer will mean to me and how while i plead i am held back by a reverence and a sensitive adoration for you for my sally you are my goddess and i am only your devoted soldier hoping my darling that you heeded your soldiers admonition and are now safe across the black water i am taking the risk of sending to you at ivor by my boy servant bob a little box of dulces and a note filled with adoration my orders to follow hoods division have been countermanded hood was hurried on from the black water by rail to rejoin marse robert who has just gained a great victory at chancellorsville i am ordered instead to proceed at once with three of my brigades to petersburg via the jerusalem plankroad to intercept a cavalry raid perhaps my darling i shall have met these raiders ere this reaches you who knows how many of us may then hear the rollcall from the other side and be sorry but sorry for whom for the comrades who answer to their names and are reported present or for those whose spirit voices just born have not yet gained the power to reach the ear of the orderly and who are reported dead even though they too answer here for my darling there is no death and you must feel must know now and always that whether here or there at the rollcall your soldier answers here now adieu my beloved close your brown eyes and feel my arms around you for i am holding you close oh so close forever your soldier each day my darling takes me farther and farther away from you from all i love and hold dear we have been guarding the passes of the blue ridge today under orders from marse robert we cross the potomac mclaws and hoods divisions and the three brigades of my division follow on after hill may our heavenly father bless us with an early and a victorious return but even then the price of it the price of it my little one the blood of our countrymen god in his mercy temper the wind to us i as i returned the salute of my men many of them beardless boys the terrible responsibility as their commander almost overwhelmed me and my heart was rent in prayer for guidance and help oh the desolate homes the widows and orphans and heartbroken mothers that this campaign will make i how many of them so full of hope and cheer now will cross that other river which lands them at the eternal home have faith my little one keep up a skookum tumtum your soldier feels that he will return to claim his bride his beautiful glorious bride and then we shall be so happy my darling that all our days to come we will show our loving gratitude to our father for his mercy in sparing us to each other now my sally how i hate to say it adieu do you remember how many times we said goodby that last evening and then as i heard the latch of the gate click and shut me out i was obliged to go back i could not stand the cruelty of the sound of that latch it seemed to knife my soul i turned back and said good night the door was open i came in you thought i had gone i cant just remember how many times i said goodnight i know i did not close the gate as i went out again keep another gate open for the good morning my precious bridetobe oh the bliss to be the bliss to be then for your soldier i never could quite enjoy being a conquering hero no my dear there is something radically wrong about my hurrah ism i can fight for a cause i know to be just can risk my own life and the lives of those in my keeping without a thought of the consequences but when weve conquered when weve downed the enemy and won the victory i dont want to hurrah i want to go off all by myself and be sorry for them want to lie down in the grass away off in the woods somewhere or in some lone valley on the hillside far from all human sound and rest my soul and put my heart to sleep and get back something i dont know what but something i had that is gone from me something subtle and unexplainable something i never knew i had till i had lost it till it was gone gone gone i yesterday my men were marching victoriously through the little town of greencastle the bands all playing our glorious soul inspiring southern airs the bonny blue flag my maryland her bright smile haunts me still and the soldiers all happy hopeful joyously keeping time to the music many following it with their voices and making up for the want of the welcome they were not receiving in the enemys country by cheering themselves and giving themselves a welcome as flowerees band playing dixie was passing a vinebowered home a young girl rushed out on the porch and waved a united states flag then either fearing that it might be taken from her or finding it too large and unwieldy she fastened it around her as an apron and taking hold of it on each side and waving it in defiance called out with all the strength of her girlish voice and all the courage of her brave young heart traitors traitors traitors come and take this flag the man of you who dares knowing that many of my men were from a section of the country which had been within the enemys lines and fearing lest some might forget their manhood i took off my hat and bowed to her saluted her flag and then turned facing the men who felt and saw my unspoken order and dont you know that they were all virginians and didnt forget if and that almost every man lifted his cap and cheered the little maiden who though she kept on waving her flag ceased calling us traitors till letting it drop in front of her she cried out oh i wish i wish i had a rebel flag id wave that too the picture of that little girl in the vine covered porch beneath the purple morning glories with their closed lips and bowed heads waiting and saving their prettiness and bloom for the coming morn of course i thought of you my darling for the time that little greencastle yankee girl with her beloved flag was my own little promisedtobewife receiving from her soldier and her soldiers soldiers the reverence and homage due her we left the little girl standing there with the flag gathered up in her arms as if too sacred to be waved now that even the enemy had done it reverence as ever your soldier we crossed the potomac on the 24th at williamsport and went into bivouac on the maryland side from which place i sent my ladylove a long letter and some flowers gathered on the way we then went on to hagerstown where we met a p hills corps which had crossed the river farther down from hagerstown i sent to the same and only ladylove another letter which was not only freighted with all the adoration and devotion of her soldiers heart but contained messages from the staff and promises to take care of him and bring him safely back to her we made no delay at hagerstown but passing through in the rear of hills corps moved on up cumberland valley and bivouacked at greencastle where the most homesick letter of all yet written was sent to well guess whom this time why to the same ladylove the sweetest loveliest flower that ever blossomed to bless and make fairer a beautiful world for it is beautiful betokening in its loveliness nothing of this deadly strife between men who should be brethren of a great and common cause as they are the heritage of a great and common country the officers and men are all in excellent condition bright and cheerful singing songs and telling stories full of hope and courage inspired with absolute faith and confidence in our success there is no straggling no disorder no dissatisfaction no plundering and there are no desertions think of it my darling an army of sixty thousand men marching through the enemys country without the least opposition the object of this great movement is of course unknown to us its purpose and our destination are known at present only to the commanding general and his chief lieutenants the men generally believe that the intention is to entirely surround the army of the potomac and place washington and baltimore within our grasp they think that marse robert is merely threatening the northern cities with the view of suddenly turning down the susquehanna cutting off all railroad connections destroying all bridges throwing his army north of baltimore and cutting off washington and that beauregard is to follow on directly from richmond via manassas to washington in rear of hooker who of course will be in pursuit of marse robert nous verrons we reached here this morning june 27th the anniversary of the battle of gainess mill where your soldier was wounded we marched straight through the town of chambersburg which was more deserted than goldsmiths village the stores and houses were all closed with here and there groups of uncheerful boers of deutschland descent earnestly talking more sylvan shadows than smiles wreathing their faces i had given orders that the bands were not to play but as we were marching through the northeastern part of the city some young ladies came out onto the veranda of one of the prettiest homes in the town and asked would you mind shooting off the bands a bit so the command was given and the band played home sweet home annie laurie her bright smile haunts me still nellie gray and hazel dell the young ladies asked the next band that passed if they wouldnt play dixie but the band instead struck up the old oaken bucket the swanee river the old arm chair the lone rock by the sea and auld lang syne thought you was rebels whered you come from anyhow cant play dixie none of you they called out we marched straight on through the city and are camped four miles beyond the town on the york river road tomorrow if youll promise not to divulge it to a human soul ill tell you a great secret no my darling i cant wait till tomorrow ill tell you right now so listen and cross your heart that you wont tell i love you love you love you and oh little one i want to see you so that is the secret lovingly and forever your soldier i wish my darling you could see this wonderfully rich and prosperous country abounding in plenty with its great strong vigorous horses and oxen its cows and crops and verdantly thriving vegetation none of the ravages of war no signs of devastation all in woeful contrast to the land where we lay dreaming all the time i break the law thou shalt not covet for every fine horse or cow i see i want for my darling and all the pretty things i see besides never mind she shall have everything some day and i shall have the universe and heavens choicest gift when she is my wife all my very own at chambersburg marse robert preached us a sermon first instructing us in the meaning of meum and teum and then taking as his text vengeance is mine saith the lord i observed that the mourners bench was not overcrowded with seekers for conversion the poor fellows were thinking of their own despoiled homes looted of everything and were not wildly enthusiastic as they acquiesced obediently to our beloved commanders order the yanks have taken into the mountains and across the susquehanna all the supplies they could and we pay liberally for those which we are compelled to take paying for them in money which is paid to us our own confederate script some of us have a few pieces of gold with which to purchase some keepsake or token for the dear ones at home alas my little one how many of us will be blessed with the giving of them god in his mercy be our commanderin chief we have not a wide field for selection here as we once had at prices dry goods store or john tylers jewelry establishment in richmond but it seems quite magnificent to us now since the richmond counters are so bare as to offer not even a wedding ring or a yard of calico we are guying general who after long and grave deliberation bought three hoop skirts as a present for his betrothed all that makes life dear is the thought of seeing you and being with you and oh what an eternity it seems since i said good night oh my darling love me pray for me hold me in your thoughts keep me in your heart our whole army is now in pennsylvania north of the river there were rumors that richmond was threatened from all sides dix from old point getty from hanover keyes from bottoms bridge and so on and that we might be recalled it turned out to be munchausen and we are still to march forward every tramp tramp tramp is a thought thought thought of my darling every halt a blessing invoked every command a loving caress and the thought of you and prayer for you make me strong make me better give me courage give me faith now my dearest let my soul speak to yours listen listen listen you hear i am answered forever and ever your soldier can my prettice do patchwork if she can she must piece together these penciled scraps of soiled paper and make out of them not a logcabin quilt but a wrens nest cement it with love and fill it with blue and golden and speckled eggs of faith and hope to hatch out greater love yet for us well the long wearying march from chambersburg through dust and heat beyond compare brought us here yesterday a few miles from gettysburg though my poor men were almost exhausted by the march in the intense heat i felt that the exigencies demanded my assuring marse robert that we had arrived and that with a few hours rest my men would be equal to anything he might require of them i sent walter with my message and rode on myself to little round top pito see old peter who i tell you dearest was mighty glad to see me and now just think of it though the old warhorse was watching a p hills attack upon the center and hood and mclaws of his own corps who had struck sickles he turned and before referring to the fighting or asking about the march inquired after you my darling while we were watching the fight walter came back with marse roberts reply to my message which was in part tell pickett im glad that he has come that i can always depend upon him and his men but that i shall not want him this evening we have been on the qui vive sweetheart since midnight and as early as three oclock were on the march about half past three garys pistol signaled the yankees attack upon gulps hill and with its echo a wail of regret went up from my very soul that the other two brigades of my old division had been left behind oh god if only i had them a surety for the honor of virginia for i can depend upon them little one they know your soldier and would follow him into the very jaws of death and he will need them right here too before hes through at early dawn darkened by the threatening rain armistead garnett kemper and your soldier held a hearttoheart powwow all three sent regards to you and old lewis pulled a ring from his little finger and making me take it said give this little token george please to her of the sunset eyes with my love and tell her the old man says since he could not be the lucky dog hes mighty glad that you are dear old lewis dear old lo as magruder always called him being short for lothario well my sally ill keep the ring for you and some day ill take it to john tyler and have it made into a breastpin and set around with rubies and diamonds and emeralds you will be the pearl the other jewel dear old lewis i just as we three separated to go our different ways after silently clasping hands our fears and prayers voiced in the good luck old man a summons came from old peter and i immediately rode to the top of the ridge where he and marse robert were making a reconnaissance of meades position great god said old peter as i came up look general lee at the insurmountable difficulties between our line and that of the yankees the steep hills the tiers of artillery the fences the heavy skirmish line and then well have to fight our infantry against their batteries look at the ground well have to charge over nearly a mile of that open ground there under the rain of their canister and shrapnel the enemy is there general longstreet and i am going to strike him said marse robert in his firm quiet determined voice about 8 oclock i rode with them along our line of prostrate infantry they had been told to lie down to prevent attracting attention and though they had been forbidden to cheer they voluntarily arose and lifted in reverential adoration their caps to our beloved commander as we rode slowly along oh the responsibility for the lives of such men as these well my darling their fate and that of our beloved southland will be settled ere your glorious brown eyes rest on these scraps of penciled paper your soldiers last letter perhaps our line of battle faces cemetery ridge our detachments have been thrown forward to support our artillery which stretches over a mile along the crests of oak ridge and seminary ridge the men are lying in the rear my darling and the hot july sun pours its scorching rays almost vertically down upon them the suffering and waiting are almost unbearable well my sweetheart at one oclock the awful silence was broken by a cannonshot and then another and then more than a hundred guns shook the hills from crest to base answered by more than another hundred the whole world a blazing volcano the whole of heaven a thunderbolt then darkness and absolute silence then the grim and gruesome lowspoken commands then the forming of the attacking columns my brave virginians are to attack in front oh may god in mercy help me as he never helped before i have ridden up to report to old peter i shall give him this letter to mail to you and a package to give you if oh my darling do you feel the love of my heart the prayer as i write that fatal word now i go but remember always that i love you with all my heart and soul with every fiber of my being that now and forever i am yours yours my beloved it is almost three oclock my soul reaches out to yours my prayers ill keep up a skookum tumtum for virginia and for you my darling your soldier my letter of yesterday my darling written before the battle was full of hope and cheer even though it told you of the long hours of waiting from four in the morning when garys pistol rang out from the federal lines signaling the attack upon gulps hill to the solemn eightoclock review of my men who rose and stood silently lifting their hats in loving reverence as marse robert old peter and your own soldier reviewed them on then to the deadly stillness of the five hours following when the men lay in the tall grass in the rear of the artillery line the july sun pouring its scorching rays almost vertically down upon them till one oclock when the awful silence of the vast battlefield was broken by a cannonshot which opened the greatest artillery duel of the world the firing lasted two hours when it ceased we took advantage of the blackened field and in the glowering darkness formed our attacking column just before the brow of seminary ridge i closed my letter to you a little before three oclock and rode up to old peter for orders i found him like a great lion at bay i have never seen him so grave and troubled for several minutes after i had saluted him he looked at me without speaking then in an agonized voice the reserve all gone he said pickett i am being crucified at the thought of the sacrifice of life which this attack will make i have instructed alexander to watch the effect of our fire upon the enemy and when it begins to tell he must take the responsibility and give you your orders for i cant while he was yet speaking a note was brought to me from alexander after reading it i handed it to him asking if i should obey and go forward he looked at me for a moment then held out his hand presently clasping his other hand over mine without speaking he bowed his head upon his breast i shall never forget the look in his face nor the clasp of his hand when i said then general i shall lead my division on i had ridden only a few paces when i remembered your letter and forgive me thoughtlessly scribbled in a corner of the envelope if old peters nod means death then goodby and god bless you little one turned back and asked the dear old chief if he would be good enough to mail it for me as he took your letter from me my darling i saw tears glistening on his cheeks and beard the stern old warhorse god bless him was weeping for his men and i know praying too that this cup might pass from them i obeyed the silent assent of his bowed head an assent given against his own convictions given in anguish and with reluctance my brave boys were full of hope and confident of victory as i led them forth forming them in column of attack and though officers and men alike knew what was before them knew the odds against them they eagerly offered up their lives on the altar of duty having absolute faith in their ultimate success over on cemetery ridge the federals beheld a scene never before witnessed on this continent a scene which has never previously been enacted and can never take place again an army forming in line of battle in full view under their very eyes charging across a space nearly a mile in length over fields of weaving grain and anon of stubble and then a smooth expanse moving with the steadiness of a dress parade the pride and glory soon to be crushed by an overwhelming heartbreak well it is all over now the battle is lost and many of us are prisoners many are dead many wounded bleeding and dying your soldier lives and mourns and but for you my darling he would rather a million times rather be back there with his dead to sleep for all time in an unknown grave your sorrowing soldier on the fourth far from a glorious fourth to us or to any with love for his fellowmen i wrote you just a line of heartbreak the sacrifice of life on that blood soaked field on the fatal third was too awful for the heralding of victory even for our victorious foe who i think believe as we do that it decided the fate of our cause no words can picture the anguish of that rollcall the breathless waits between the responses the here of those who by gods mercy had miraculously escaped the awful rain of shot and shell was a sob a gasp a knell for the unanswered name of his comrade there was no tone of thankfulness for having been spared to answer to their names but rather atoll and an unvoiced wish that they too had been among the missing even now i can hear them cheering as i gave the order forward i can feel the thrill of their joyous voices as they called out all along the line well follow you marse george well follow you well follow you oh how faithfully they kept their word following me on on to their death and i believing in the promised support led them on on on oh god i cant write you a loveletter today my sally for with my great love for you and my gratitude to god for sparing my life to devote to you comes the overpowering thought of those whose lives were sacrificed of the brokenhearted widows and mothers and orphans the moans of my wounded boys the sight of the dead upturned faces flood my soul with grief and here am i whom they trusted whom they followed leaving them on that field of carnage and guarding four thousand prisoners across the river back to winchester such a duty for men who a few hours ago covered themselves with glory eternal well my darling i put the prisoners all on their honor and gave them equal liberties with my own soldier boys my first command to them was to go and enjoy themselves the best they could and they have obeyed my order today a dutchman and two of his comrades came up and told me that they were lost and besought me to help them find their comrades they had been with my men and were separated from their own comrades so i sent old floyd off on st paul to find out where they belonged and deliver them this is too gloomy and too poor a letter for so beautiful a sweetheart but it seems sacrilegious almost to say i love you with the hearts that are stilled to love on the field of battle your soldier i am enclosing you a copy of general lees official letter of july 9th in answer to mine of the 8th the same day on which i wrote you who deserved something brighter that ghostly woeful letter general lees letter has been published to the division in general orders and received with appreciative satisfaction the soldiers one and all love and honor lee and his sympathy and praise are always very dear to them just after the order was published i heard one of the men rather rough and uncouth and not as are most of the men to the manner born say as he wiped away the tears with the back of his hand daggone him daggone him daggone his old soul im blamed ef i wouldnt be daggone willin to go right through it all and be killed again with them others to hear marse robert daggone him say over again as how he grieved boutn we alls losses and honored us for wealls bravery darned ef i wouldnt isnt that reverential adoration my darling to be willing to be killed again for a word of praise it seems selfish and inhuman to speak of love haunted as i am with the unnecessary sacrifice of the lives of so many of my brave boys i cant think of anything but the desolate homes in virginia and the unknown dead in pennsylvania at the beginning of the fight i was so sanguine so sure of success early in the morning i had been assured by alexander that general lee had ordered that every brigade in his command was to charge cemetery hill so i had no fear of not being supported alexander also assured me of the support of his artillery which would move ahead of my division in the advance he told me that he had borrowed seven twelvepound howitzers from pendleton lees chief of artillery which he had put in reserve to accompany me in the morning i rode with him while he by longstreets orders selected the salient angle of the wood in which my line was formed which line was just on the left of his seventyfive guns at about a quarter to three oclock when his written order to make the charge was handed to me and dear old peter after reading it in sorrow and fear reluctantly bowed his head in assent i obeyed leading my three brigades straight on the enemys front you never saw anything like it they moved across that field of death as a battalion marches forward in line of battle upon drill each commander in front of his command leading and cheering on his men two lines of the enemys infantry were driven back two lines of guns were taken and no support came pendleton without alexanders knowledge had sent four of the guns which he had loaned him to some other part of the field and the other three guns could not be found the two brigades which were to have followed me had poor fellows been seriously engaged in the fights of the two previous days both of their commanding officers had been killed and while they had been replaced by gallant competent officers these new leaders were unknown to the men two lines of their infantry were driven back two lines of guns were taken and no support came ah if i had only had my other two brigades a different story would have been flashed to the world it was too late to retreat and to go on was death or capture poor old dick garnett did not dismount as did the others of us and he was killed instantly falling from his horse kemper desperately wounded was brought from the field and subsequently taken prisoner dear old lewis armistead god bless him was mortally wounded at the head of his command after planting the flag of virginia within the enemys lines seven of my colonels were killed and one was mortally wounded nine of my lieutenant colonels were wounded and three lieutenant colonels were killed only one field officer of my whole command colonel cabell was unhurt and the loss of my company officers was in proportion i wonder my dear if in the light of the great eternity we shall any of us feel this was for the best and shall have learned to say thy will be done no castles today sweetheart no the bricks of happiness and the mortar of love must lie untouched in this lowering gloom pray dear for the sorrowing ones your soldier it would be impossible my darling to describe to you even the half of the horrors and hardships of these last days from the first nights long march to the present hour not only for ourselves but for the prisoners vhom with shattered hopes and heartbreak ve the little remnant of my division have been assigned to guard one prisoner is too many for us who havent a crust to go around among ourselves as old jack said oh the pity of it guarding these prisoners through their own country depleted and suffering mentally and physically as we are and being forced to march forward with a speed beyond their own and our endurance it maybe some consolation to both that we suffer alike from fatigue hunger exhaustion and wet for the excessive rains which set in on the fourth have continued unabated the long wagontrains the artillery the assortment of vehicles of all kinds impressed from the farmers and loaded to their utmost capacity with our wounded and anon room made for the crowding in of yet another falling from illness or exhaustion all along our way have added their quota to the discomforts of the march our commissariat too has been as wretched here in this land of plenty as it was in the barren war ridden land we left behind our banquets we the guard of honor and our guests the prisoners have shared likeandlike and none was ever more enjoyed by either than the flour made into paste and baked on the stones in front of the fire and the good pennsylvania beef roasted on the end of a stick by the way my sally when you are my little housekeeper you must remember that this stickend roasting is a mighty toothsome recipe for cooking beef the prisoners have been far more cheerful than we have been for they have not only had strong hope of being retaken by their own arms within a few days but their army has gained a great victory and though dearly bought it has i fear decided the fate of our newborn nation the cannonading on the second morning the shells from which we could clearly see bursting somewhere in the vicinity of the monterey house and which we learned were from kilpatricks artillery endeavoring to cut off our trains and prevent our retreat gave the prisoners double assurance of release their hope of rescue being deferred at monterey springs i instructed my inspectorgeneral to parole the officers and give them safeguard to return binding them to render themselves prisoners of war at richmond if they were not duly recognized by their government unfortunately i was not permitted to release them at this point and they were required to march with the rest of the prisoners a colonel of a maine regiment colonel tilden a splendid gallant fellow so appreciative too of the very few small courtesies which it has been possible to show him asked that i cancel their paroles the main object of which had been to avoid the terrors of the march which i in honor did of course late in the evening after another trying days march we passed waynesboro and with a rest of only an hour or so marched all night at nine oclock the following morning we reached hagerstown but hurried on through to williamsport all along the road from hagerstown to williamsport were gruesome evidences of kilpatricks dash into hagerstown here a dead cavalryman there a broken caisson a dead horse i ought not to let your beautiful eyes see through mine all these horrors but some day my darling someday well strew roses and violets and lilies over them all even over the memories of them well listen to the resurrection that hope and faith and love voice in all the songs of nature it will not be long darling for today the official news of the surrender of vicksburg reached us the tidings brought cheers from the prisoners and increased the sullen gloom of their guard i am directed to turn the prisoners over to general imbodens command who is to escort them to staunton their final destination will i suppose be the old nineroom brick warehouse on carey street in richmond libby sons ship chandlers and grocers a sign which i remember as a boy and associate with cat and truant and other boyish games always i shall like to remember it as a place to play and not think of it as a living tomb there will not i fear be many of my fellowsufferers of the last few days who enter these awesome walls who will ever come forth alive the potomac was so swollen by the rains which began on the fourth and still continue that it was impossible to cross it at any of the neighboring fords a rope ferry the only means of crossing made it slow and tedious and every minutes delay my darling seems centuries when i am on my way to you to you jackerie has waited so long for my postscript that he has gone to sleep and i have now not time to write it but you will know that the most important thing is in the p sand this is love the love of your adoring soldier old peter is to go to tennessee to reen force bragg he has placed his plans before the secretary of war now my darling i have just had a long powwow with him old peter who old warhorse as he is has been in love himself is still in love will always be in love and knows of our love of our plighted troth and knowing it tells me it is his purpose to take me with him on this proposed expedition now my sally your soldier is a soldier and never even to himself questions an order his not to reason why darling do you know what this means why my little one it means that you havent one moments respite it means that you are to be mrs general george pickett my precious wife right away it means that you are to fulfill your promise to come to me at a moments notice yours too now not to reason why but to obey and come at once we cannot brook any delay my darling so pack up your knapsack never mind the rations and the ammunition but come my aunt olivia with uncle andrew one of my staff and one of my couriers will meet you and your dear parents on this side of the black water and will escort you to petersburg where i shall be waiting at the train to meet you i shall see you all to the hotel where you will wait while your father bright and i get the license and make other necessary arrangements for our immediate marriage which i have planned to take place sine die at st pauls church our old friend doctor piatt will pronounce the words that make us one in the sight of the world from the church we will go to the depot where a special train having been arranged for us by our friend mr reuben raglan god bless him will take us over to richmond where my little sister is waiting longingly to love and welcome my wife her new sister my darling will realize how impossible it is for her soldier to consult with her and will forgive his bungling and awkwardness never mind after this she shall do all the planning oh what a heaven on earth is before us if only this cruel war were over a dios forgive this business letter courier awaits you will come i have no fear forever your soldier it seems an age my darling since we rode away leaving you and mrs ransom standing in that wonderful grove of maiden trees i veil the annoying disappointing scenes since then and see again the beautiful picture of my own bride clothed in white in the greenery with the grandfather squirrels playing all around her climbing over her and eating from her dainty graceful hands mine mine all my own i said invoking our fathers care of you oh my love all my happiness is in your hands and as you love me guard your precious self from all harm i have you on my heart all the day ransom sent on our letters from kingston via the ugr i hope they reached you safely old floyd sent a most mysterious looking package to you and mrs ransom which he said you must both thank st paul for in floyds opinion st paul has as much to answer for as the great apostle for whom he is named certainly in appearance he is as insignificant looking as a horse as st paul has been described as a man and while he has not had one much less five shipwrecks he has had all manner of hairbreadth escapes hardships indignities and a million times more stripes all of which he has borne with christian resignation and endurance well dearest my name is george and my patience and temper accord with the name our wellformed plans for the capture of newbern miscarried hokes clingmans and corses brigades and reids artillery under my command were to make a feint to threaten on the south side of the neuse river dearings cavalry and three regiments of infantry under dearing were to make a demonstration on the north side of the neuse ransom barton and terry under barton were to make the real attack while we created a diversion and drew off the enemy simultaneously with our movements colonel r taylor wood was to take a naval force in small boats make a night excursion down the neuse and attack the gunboats the soldiers were all jubilant buoyant and hopeful everything was propitious victory seemed sure general bearings feint was successful hoke and corse and clingman crossed over taking all the defenses and outworks in front woods attack was a complete surprise capturing a gunboat right under the guns of the fort but alas the real attack by barton was not made we waited in deathlike suspense hour after hour of restless anxiety and impatience went by and yet no sound of a gun and no message came to tell me why the torture and suspense were unbearable newbern was ours ours if well hope died out and the dejection and despair of the men with their hopes dashed cannot be told as ever your soldier your soldier breathes easier this morning my darling a great load is lifted haygoods brave south carolina brigade came in yesterday thank god and i stationed them at port walthall junction this will keep the connection between petersburg and richmond open wises brigade got in today and was sent out toward city point for nights i have not closed my eyes how could i with a whole city full of helpless defenseless women and children at the mercy of an oncoming army butlers whole force in transports protected by his gunboats landed at city point and bermuda hundred and no army here to meet them not enough soldiers boys and old men all put together even for picket duty come to think of it my prettice you must have been up all night to have made up and sent out such a basket of goodies and baked and buttered such a lot of biscuits and made so many jugs of coffee as came this morning my i tell you it all tasted good and the coffee well no mocha or java ever tasted half so good as this ryesweetpotato blend and think of your thoughtfulness in wrapping blankets around the jugs to keep the coffee hot bless your thoughtful heart you are without doubt the dearest most indefatigable little piece of perfection that ever rode a horse or buttered a biscuit or plucked a flower or ever did anything else as to that then those hyacinths and geranium leaves who else in all this nerveracking starving perilous time would have thought of gathering flowers my nigger bob the loyal but unappreciative scamp apologetically took out the baskets which were apparently filled with the yet dew kissed fragrant flowers and said mrs stratton and mrs johnson sent out large hampers too to us they came just after we had finished with your baskets and we passed them on to others and now my darling what on earth did you mean by saying never mind as you said goodby and rode away yesterday it troubled me all night i wanted to follow after you and ask you what you meant but couldnt i would have jumped on lucy and ridden in to petersburg and found out if it had been possible for me to leave i was so troubled about it that i was almost tempted to come in anyhow for the life of me little one i couldnt think of any reason why you should say never mind to me were you aggrieved because your blundering old soldier told you there was no necessity for your coming out to bring the dispatches any longer that thank heaven the recruits and reenforcements were coming in now and that we could manage all right i did not mean to hurl you dear i hoped youd send a line by bob telling me what you meant and why you had said it but when i asked him if you had written he said now please my darling send bob back right away with a nice letter and tell your soldier that you did not mean anything by saying never mind to him for he loves you with all his heart and would not wound or disappoint or offend you for anything in the world your soldier baird has just come in from the lines my darling wife and reports that all is well i came in about eleven and was lying in my tent all alone thinking of you and while i builded wonderful castles i was serenading you with the songs i love i think i had finished all the songs i had ever sung to you and when baird came in my thoughts had wandered to the salmoniuahie and i was singing anne boleyns song oh death rock me asleep which was taught me by my friend captain g p hornby of her majestys ship tribune away out in san juan island on the pacific coast in 1859 i do not know why i was singing this song except that it is beautiful and one of the finest and sweetest of melodies both the air and words were written by poor unfortunate anne boleyn i know but one verse if hornby ever knew other verses he had forgotten them but the one i know is appealing i will write it for you if i may oh death rock me asleep bring me to quiet and rest let pass my weary guiltless life out of my careful breast toll on the passing bell ring out my doleful knell let thy sound my death tell death doth draw me death doth draw me there is no remedy baird stopped outside and listened and then came in asking permission to order bob to light the dips and saying please sir marse george when you sing that song i havent got a friend in the world im lonesome and feel creeps and see spooks and whats worse i dont know whether i am anne boleyn herself or am myself responsible for all poor annes sorrows and death so i stopped singing and am writing to tell you a great secret which is i love you some day when we are happy so happy that nothing could make us any happier ill sing this song to you last night there was a night attack several of the men were wounded slightly but the face of one perhaps seriously wounded haunts me he is a boy with golden brown curls somebodys darling tonight we made a capture of the federal pickets sweeping their riflepits for more than a hundred yards and taking a hundred and thirtysix prisoners you know our lines are so close together in many places that we the yankees and my men can with voices raised carry on a conversation war and its horrors and yet i sing and whistle oh my sweetheart if only this wicked war were over so that we could in peace and quiet tranquilly finish the book of love which we have but just begun adios now i see old jackerie in the flap with his pack and bag his wonted grace and patience his dolcefarniente eyes and soft southern italian voice saying no huuanon enty but i must hurry for he starts at daybreak and it is now past midnight lovingly now and forever your soldier here we are still my darling my division is stationed with the rest of the first corps between new and old cold harbor old peter having been wounded in the wilderness anderson has been put in command of the first corps grant has been appointed lieutenant general and has arrived at nearly the same point in his march down the river that mcclellan reached in his upward progress in 62 over a crimson road both armies have returned to cold harbor the wilderness alas is one vast graveyard where sleep thousands of grants soldiers but grant like our stonewall is fighting not to save lives but country 1 for the second time now cold harbor has become a battleground two years ago it furnished the field for the battle of gainess mill which the yankees called cold harbor where your soldier was wounded does it seem to you as long ago as two years my darling to me it seems but yesterday that i lay in richmond at my little sisters and you came to see me blessing and cheering me i can feel now the soft touch of your little white hands as you gently stroked and soothed my wounded shoulder and swollen arm and hand do you remember one afternoon while you were reading from moores melodies not that i heard or took in the meaning of a single word of them for i only heard the music of your wonderful voice and saw the long dark lashes caressing the words which those cupidshaped cherry lips were uttering that our dear old stonewall was announced of course i knew his calling was out of the usual and i was honored and gratified by his coming but any guest was unwelcome if i had to share with him my darling i remember that you marked the place you were reading with your dainty scented handkerchief which i stole and still have you and my sister were about to withdraw but both the general and i urged you to remain i shall always hold sacred old jacks visit and remember its every detail do you recall how indignant our maidservant was at what she supposed a reflection upon the mintjuleps she was serving you remember the uncompromising stern old puritan declined saying take that liquor away i never touch strong drink i like it too well to fool with it and no mans strength is strong enough to touch that stuff with impunity you remember how though she politely curtsied poor julie humbly but vigorously defending her juleps replied scuse me marse genul jackson but dese yer drams aint got no impunities in em suh nor suh braxton done en mek em outn wealls vey bes old london dock brandy outn one of wealls cobweb bottles old jackerie brought me your letter on the first just after the yankees attack on hoke and kershaw breaking their outer lines that night grant transferred his right to a point beyond cold harbor on the afternoon of the second marse robert ordered an assault on grants right but old jubal found it invincible and went to work erecting defenses i believe it was old jube who gave marse robert the title of oldspadeslee or old ace of spades because of his incessant activity in throwing up defenses trenches breastworks etc this morning grant made an assault along the entire six miles of our line and our guns opened a counter attack followed by advance skirmishes of my division the whole confederate line poured a stream of fire and thousands of grants soldiers have gone to reenforce the army of the dead oh this is all a weary long mistake may the merciful and true god wield power to end it ere another day passes your soldier outside my darling the band has been playing the songs that we love and inside i have been softly singing them all to you to your spirit far away now they have wound up with alice where art thou which might have set me wondering if it had not been the hour we each seek to be alone that we may bring our souls in touch so i knew that thou wert with me this morning tom friend brought me a weesome package of tea which he wishes sent to you one of the men he said swapped his tobacco for it if the whole universe were mine id lay it at your feet for love has builded in my heart three altars for thy worship one to faith one to hope one to service and you my goddess whom i worship must feed my faith illumine my hope and command my service this morning for reasons which you will presently note i was thinking of our ever memorable ride from petersburg its anxieties and pleasures your indomitable pluck and merry laughter on that day pass before me making me shudder with fear or thrill with happiness it was on your birthday you remember and beauregard had been forced to leave his intrenchments at early daylight and butler had walked into them and had succeeded in reaching the richmond and peters burg railroad and was destroying the track when the advance guard of my division ran him off i had left you in the rear and had gone on about a quarter of a mile in advance of my division and was riding quietly along with the members of my staff and general rh anderson who was then commanding the corps we were some ten miles or so from petersburg when we were ambushed and fired into by a portion of butlers troops hun tons brigade was followed up by my other brigades and we drove the enemy back toward bermuda hundred where they were stopped by my men who retook the whole line this gallant and unexpected action so pleased marse robert that he yesterday had published the inclosed notice which i send you that you may be reminded of my glorious fearless men who yet survived that awful third of july where so many of their comrades were left to sleep the line of breastworks which they took and to which marse robert refers in the notice inclosed is most important as the main line of defense between richmond and petersburg and opposing any advance of the enemy upon the peninsula of bermuda hundred now my darling sees why i am thinking of that 1 6th of may it was because she though marse robert doesnt know it comes in fora share of his praise i am thinking of you every minute and wish that i could ride in if only for an hour between sundown and midnight to see you but to use mr lincolns expressive words grant is so infernally interruptious that i am afraid to take the risk now my strayed angel of the skies dont be disappointed i love you good night may all blessings bless you all sunshine shine for you all angels guard you all that is good take care of you and all heaven help me to be worthy of you forever and ever your soldier was my letter of yesterday strenuous well it was a strenuous day full of rumors and contradictions and yet in spite of it i managed to sandwich in between the shelling and the movement of the fleet and the distinguished visitors the ever new and true story of my love but i had only time to make the bare announcement at the close of that letter that butler had burned our home the day before if it had been burned in line of battle it would have been all right but it was not it was burned by butler at a great expense to the government and in revenge for having been outgeneraled by a little handful of my men at petersburg and for grants telegram to mr lincoln saying pickett has bottled up butler at petersburg mr sims who has been our overseer ever since i can remember came up from turkey island this morning to tell me all about it the poor old fellow loved the old place and is heartbroken over its destruction he says they first looted the house and then shelled and burned it together with the barn and stables he is very bitter and vindictive and vows all manner of eternal vengeance the poor old chap is sensitive because i did not rave and rage with him and resents what he considers my indifference he gave me the benefit of all the swear words in his vocabulary when i tried to make him understand that there are weightier things and subjects of greater moment than the mere loss of personal property personal property he quoted indignantly why turkey island was your masand pas and their mas and pas before em think of them big oaks them maiden trees the river and everything think of all the big men thats set round that old mahogany table and jingled their glasses at that big old sideboard personal property why when you was just a turning six your pa and me showed you the very halting place whar in january 1781 that traitor benedict arnold stopped on his march to richmond after he had come up with the fleet at jamestown and then went on to westover personal property why i remember the very day we sot you up in the crotch of that great old oak tree under which governor jefferson and mr edmund randolph lighted from their fillies and tied them to one of the limbs till they could walk a piece and see for themselves that old monument put up in 171 1 eleven years before that time to show how much devilment a river could do if it had the elements to help it personal property i why sir there want a picture or a piece of furniture or a statuary in that old home that want only seasoned with age but had a store of valuableness to it besides and you passive and peaceable taking the news all quiet as if it had been nothing but a fence rail burnt up and telling me to my face and me abustin out with damnation from every pore that you had heard of the fire that mr enroughty had reported the burning of turkey island yesterday reported personal property i wonder if a mans soul is personal property well if it is and mr satan should ever report to me that he wanted any help to keep up his fire to burn mr butlers or any of his kind of personal property he would know where to get it poor mr sims i ive sent him with one of my couriers to find some of his friends in the trenches where i hope he will work off some of his wrath over butler and his kind and my unfortunate phrase personal property of course you know my darling that i am not unmindful of the sacredness of the old home and that i grieve that it has been destroyed but we will build us another home wont we the river is there and some of the old trees are left and if god should bless us with a son i shall when he is as old as i was then take him under this same old historic tree that mr sims speaks of and tell him in the very language of my father some of the old stories he used to tell me and introduce him to the great men of those days as my father made me acquainted with them i can hear him now say my son there was madison a very very small man with introverted eyes and ample forehead he dressed always in a surtout of brown which was generally dusty and oftener than otherwise faded and shabby judge marshall was very tall and commanding and revolutionary and patriarchal in appearance he had fine expressive eyes and dressed always in a wellfitting surtout of blue mr john randolph was puny and frail and most uncommon looking he was swarthy and wrinkled with eyes as brilliant as stars of the first magnitude watkins leigh was unusually distinguished in appearance taze well was tall and fine looking but mr monroe was very wrinkled and weatherbeaten and so exceedingly awkward that he stumbled over his own feet and walked on everyone elses governor giles used a crutch always and talked like molasses in july my father never used madeup words or a childrens vocabulary in describing to me men and events he would say words are things my son i want you to know them and not be like the british officer who when he and some of his command were taken prisoners and were told by their captors that they were to be paroled demanded in great terror and consternation pray what kind of death is that oh my sally i dream of the happy days when you will be the fair mistress of turkey island under those old trees with the james river always before us and love always with us as the sun in the firmament so is love in the world love the life of the spirit the root of every virtuous action it enhanceth prosperity easeth adversity and maketh of the slightest twist a gordian knot it gives vigor to the atmosphere fragrance to the flower color to the rainbow zest to life music to laughter and oh such laughter as yours my own my beautiful i love you with all my heart and soul and mind and being a dios keep this love close your soldier god bless you little mother of our boy bless and keep you heaven in all its glory shine upon you edens flowers bloom eternal for you almost with every breath since the message came relieving my anxiety and telling me that my darling lived and that a little baby had been born to us i have been a baby myself though i have known all these months that from across loves enchanted land this little child was on its way to our twin souls now that gods promise is fulfilled and it has come i cant believe it as i think of it i feel the stir of paradise in my senses and my spirit goes up in thankfulness to god for this his highest and best the one perfect flower in the garden of life love blinding tears rolled down my cheeks my sweetheart as i read the glad tidings and a feeling so new so strange came over me that i asked of the angels what it could be and whence came the strains of celestial music which filled my soul and what were the great grand stirring hosannas and the soft tender sweet adagios that circled round and round warmed my every vein beat in my every pulse and oh little mother of my boy the echoing answer came a little baby has been born to you and he and the newborn mother live i wanted to fly to you both kneel by your bedside take your hand and his little hand in mine and lift our hearts in thankfulness to the heavenly throne but when i applied to the great tyee for a pass to richmond saying my son was born this morning he replied your country was born almost a hundred years ago it was the first word of reproach marse robert ever spoke to me but he was right and i was reckless to ask things may be quieter tomorrow sweetheart perhaps even tonight and i may be able to come in for an hour i must not write another word though i want to write on and on and send messages and kisses to the little baby and to caution its mother to be careful and to tell her she is ten thousand times more precious than ever but i must not lovingly and forever and ever your soldier our boys birthday blessed day god has heard our prayers my beloved wife oh the ecstatic pleasure i felt when charles brought the doctors letter precious one you must obey every injunction of our dear aunt do not think of writing or exerting yourself in any way she knows all about what should be done i am coming to you this evening should general lee say so and he will for i have sent bright post haste to him telling him of the glory of the star in the east oh my pretty wife i long to see you and your little son our son little newborn mother i have humbly thanked god for his great and bounteous goodness every breath i breathe is one of gratitude to him for sparing you to me and giving us a son thou life of my soul ever and forever your devoted soldier blessed day my men had all heard of the arrival of the little general as they call him and when i was riding out of camp last night to surrender to him i noticed the bonfires which were being kindled all along my lines and knew that my loyal loving men were lighting them in honor of my baby but i did not know till this morning that dear old ingalls at grants suggestion had kindled a light on the other side of the lines too and i was overcome with emotion when i learned of it today their note of congratulation marked unofficial which i inclose came to me through the lines you must keep it for the baby with the pass and note of marse robert which i put into its little clenched hand babyl can it be true my darling heaven knows no deeper devotion no deeper gratitude than that which filled my heart when i realized that the golden dream of life had come to pass was true when i looked upon the sweet shy face of my girl bride and saw it transformed into the sacred tenderness of motherhood saw the grace and charm the soulborn protecting look in the mother eyes the lilied sweetness of her face the smile of unlanguaged mystery with a gentleness and patience as sweet and meek as mother mary wore i knew it was the alpha and omega of heaven i see still the moss rose bud left by the blumenengel as a bescheidenen schmuck of his love nestling in your snowwhite arms and the long dark lashes kissing your cheeks as you look down upon it i still feel the mystic power of the grasp of its tiny rose leaf fingers clutched around my own but i must not write another word not one lovingly your soldier i have but a few moments since my pretty one returned from a ride with the tyee up one hill and down the other the enemy occupied dutch gap last evening this is higher up the river than i am and i had expected the navy to take care of our rear but they have allowed them to come in and now i have to stretch out my india rubber division well my pet i have to do it the general did not seem in a remarkably good humor with the news from mobile and bradley johnson in the valley and this impudence of the yankees in crawling up behind us i am so glad my own that you are better thank the good god for it blair says you must not keep the baby in your arms so much that you are acting mother and nurse both please listen to the doctor this time and to your husbands pleading blair says that his indisposition is nothing but the colic and that you must not make yourself uneasy about the little fellow you must make lucinda nurse him more i send you a chicken a cup of salt likewise an apple one single one your friend miss gamble radiant with a white frock and smiles sent it to me didnt give it with her compliments last night byebye sweet one ever your own soldier i left you yesterday my darling with many a pause and longing glance behind but out in the midst of this terrible conflict to which i have come your love is with me shielding and blessing me i reached camp just before daybreak george hustled around and made me a pot of shonough coffee wid no debultrement in it and while i drank my coffee he kept off the flies which early as it was had begun to be very sociable entertaining me the while with news of the camp and his own views on current events having finished my breakfast george went out to get breakfast for the mess and before they had assembled i had cleared off my desk and written several letters all made affectionate inquiries for you and our little son though some of them did not know that i had ridden in last night until i told them i must go now my darling and ride around the lines and make my report but will add a few more words later on so adios till then well my darling we have had a most exciting day marse robert came out he was restive and very very silent we had just paid our respects to butlers diggers when he arrived the device we used in so doing was a new one or rather a very old one newly revived it was a mortar battery hidden in the bushes it is invisible to the enemy and easily shifted from one hiding place to the other it used to be the only way in which shells could be thrown it throws these shells high in the air and they fall by their own weight without the least warning of their coming there is no screaming or squealing sound like that made by our modern shells they fall almost as silently as a snowflake falls and it seems to me almost barbarous to drop these silent ghostly missiles down upon those lighthearted happygolucky negroes for i learn that it is they that are doing the digging butler with promise of extra pay for extra work and extra danger has induced four hundred of the colored soldiers to volunteer to sheathe their swords and take up the shovel and go to digging the bank to be cut through is only about five feet at the highest point the canal is to be where the james makes a great bend just above dutch gap inclosing a point of land perhaps half a mile wide and about three miles in length and which at the neck is only five hundred yards across from river to river their canal would thus save them six miles and would allow their gunboats to go up the james without running the gauntlet of our howlett guns our sunken torpedoes et cetera and as our left is all at the turn of the bend they would not have to traverse the open river in search of an exposed water channel it is strange that some of our brilliant engineers havent made this near cut years ago as for me i should encourage butler and his river improvement company and cease throwing these stealthy shells whose silent fall heralds a sudden roar of explosion that strikes terror to my soul the canal will be an advantage to us and butler in digging it for us may in part atone for the many homes he has destroyed mine among them well my darling if you were not the best of all good women as well as the most beautiful of all beautiful women and the most patient of all patient ones you would weary of so tiresome a soldier who takes away the fragrance of flowers and the glory of love and sends back the echo of war and its sorrows and the babble of a loyal old cook who wouldnt be sold and wouldnt run away and whom i was obliged to permit to be credited to me in order to save him the only negro i own but come to think of it he owns me forever and ever your soldier you will be glad my darling wife that the powwow with the powers that be was most satisfactory after the evening consultation i called on the ladies at the white house and at the most earnest entreaty and solicitation of mrs davis and her sister miss howell dined with them poor mr davis looks tired and anxious but he spoke so hopefully of our success that knowing as he must know our status the condition of our army etc i should have thought that he was aware of something hopeful of which we are ignorant if he had not said later when foreign intervention was being discussed that he believed that england and in fact all the foreign powers were like the woman who saw her husband fighting a bear she didnt care a continental which was whipped but shed be the best pleased if both were and my only hope of recognition he said is that being separated we shall not be so formidable a power the dinner my dearest was beautiful and so abundant were its luxuries that i marveled greatly knowing as i do how difficult it is with most of us to get even a little tea or coffee or salt as usual mrs davis was vivacious and entertaining she amusingly described her rescue of a little orphan negro from a great black brute who had constituted himself the boys guardian she told how she had him washed and combed and dressed in a suit of little joes clothes and how while he was proud of the clothes he was a thousand times prouder of and more grateful for the cuts and bruises which his selfappointed guardian had given him and which upon all occasions he triumphantly exhibited as medals of honor she said that the little rascal was greatly troubled when the cuts were finally healed and tried to reopen them with a dog knife which was taken away he was then reproved and forbidden to make over his wounds with her keen sense of humor mrs davis told us how when learning that one after another of her maids was being bribed by the yankees with money and promises to betray the family and come over to the other side she would pretend ignorance of the intention give them food for imagination reciting for their repetition the most impossible outlandish stories some of which she told us and which i will tell my darling when i come bless her mrs davis said that betty the last one of her maids to go was such an excellent maid and so hard to replace that as soon as she began to show her prosperity appearing with silks and jewels and then with gold and notes she had tried without letting betty suspect her intention to offer her inducements to remain but had failed mrs davis said she was so depressed after bettys departure and in such dire need of mental soothing syrup that she went into retirement with adam bede a country gentleman in town and elective affinities did you ever my darling mr judah p benjamin and dr minnegerode were the only other guests mr benjamins usually wonderful judicial mind and depressing dignity were not in evidence he did rather reproachfully express his astonishment that mr davis should be bowed down with grief at the adverse criticisms of those he was trying to serve and that he should care a bauble for their accusations of nepotism and the more absurd charge of leaving his cotton to be bought by the yankees he ended by saying that he continually had to remind mr davis of that exceedingly good man mr christ you know benjamin was born at st croix in the west indies of jewish parents what a gossip your husband is my sally but i promised to write my beautiful tyrant every day everything i said or did or that anyone else said or did and i have havent i forever and ever and ever your soldier this morning at breakfast my darling sally when you suggested having an oyster roast for my officers after our conference tonight i said that i feared we should not have enough oysters our old hunter gossett has just brought in a fine large wild turkey and with that and the three bushels of oysters which your uncle sent i think we can get up a fine supper dont you my marvel of a housekeeper i hope you can and hope too that the good cheer it will provide will help us to new and encouraging suggestions for as hopeful as i always am even my heart is in my boots on every side gloom dissatisfaction and disappointment seem to have settled over all men and officers alike because of the unsuccessful termination of the peace conference on board the river queen on the fatal third the anxious despairing faces i see everywhere bespeak heavy hearts our commissioners knew that we were gasping our last gasp and that the peace conference was a forlorn hope because of the informality of the conference and my knowledge of mr lincoln his humanity his broad nature his warm heart i did believe he would take advantage of this very informality and spring some wise superhuman surprise which would somehow restore peace and in time insure unity now heaven help us it will be war to the knife with a knife no longer keen the thrust of an arm no longer strong the certainty that when peace comes it will follow the tread of the conqueror i fear that you may need more help so am sending over bob the messcook will come later meantime a dios and love your soldier it is long past the midnight hour and like a boy i have been reading over your dear cheery letter caressing the written page because it has been touched by your hand all is quiet now but soon all will be bustle for we march at daylight oh my darling were there ever such men as those of my division this morning after the review i thanked them for their valiant services yesterday on the first of april never to be forgotten by any of us when to my mind they fought one of the most desperate battles of the whole war their answer to me was cheer after cheer one after another calling out thats all right marse george we only followed you then in the midst of these calls and silencing them rose loud and clear dear old gentrys voice singing the old hymn which they all knew i loved guide me oh thou great jehovah pilgrim through this barren land voice after voice joined in till from all along the line the plea rang forth be my sword and shield and banner be the lord my righteousness i dont think my sally the tears sounded in my voice as it mingled with theirs but they were in my eyes and there was something new in my heart when the last line had been sung i gave the order to march proceeding to this point where i had expected to cross the appomattox and rejoin the main army while we were at a halt here orders came from general r h anderson to report to him at sutherlands tavern just after mailing my letter to you at five forks telling you of our long continuous march of eighteen hours and of the strenuous hours following those where i had because of exigent circumstances been induced to fallback at daylight i received a dispatch from the great tyee telling me to hold five forks at all hazards to prevent the enemy you must have been up all night my prettice to have made up and sent out such a basket of goodies and baked and buttered such a lot of biscuit and made so many cups of coffee my i tell you it all tasted good from striking the south side railroad this dispatch was in reply to one i had sent to him reporting the state of affairs and that the enemy were trying to get in between the army and my command and asking that diversion be made at once or i should be isolated i had had all trains parked in the rear of hatchers run and much preferred that position but from the generals dispatch supposed that he intended sending reenforcements i immediately formed line of battle upon the white oak road and set my men to throwing up temporary breastworks pine trees were felled a ditch dug and the earth thrown up behind the logs the men god bless them though weary and hungry sang as they felled and dug three times in the three hours their labors were suspended because of attack from the front but they as cheerily returned to their digging and to their annie laurie and dixie as if they were banking roses for a festival five forks is situated in a flat thickly wooded country and is simply a crossing at right angles of two country roads and a deflection of a third bisecting one of these angles our line of battle short as four small brigades front must be could readily be turned on either flank by a larger attacking force do you understand my dear if not you will some day and you can keep this letter and show it to someone who will understand well i made the best arrangements of which the nature of the ground admitted placing w h f lees cavalry on the right ransoms and wallaces brigades acting as one and numbering about nine hundred on the left then corse terry and stuart numbering about three thousand six rifled pieces of artillery were placed at wide intervals fitz lees cavalry was ordered to take position on the left flank about two oclock in the afternoon sheridan made a heavy demonstration with his cavalry threatening also the right flank meantime warrens corps swept around the left flank and rear of the infantry line attacking ransom and stuart behind their breastworks ransom sent word that the cavalry was not in position and fitz lee was again ordered to cover the ground at once i supposed it had been done when suddenly the enemy in heavy infantry column appeared on our left and the attack became general ransoms horse was killed falling with his rider under him his assistant adjutant general gee was killed my dear brave old friend willie pegram was mortally wounded falling within a few yards of me just after we had exchanged klahow ya tikegh how are you love to you and good luck the captain of his pegrams battery was killed i succeeded in getting a sergeant and enough men to man one piece but after firing eight rounds the axle broke flowerees regiment fought hand to hand after all their cartridges had been used the small cavalry force which had gotten into place gave way and the enemy poured in on wallaces left charge after charge was made and repulsed and division after division of the enemy advanced upon us our left was turned we were completely entrapped their cavalry charging at a signal of musketry from the infantry enveloped us front and right and sweeping down upon our rear held us as in a vise take this marse george said one of my boys earlier in the action hastily thrusting a battleflag into my hand i took the flag stained with his blood sacred to the cause for which he fell and cheering as i waved it called on my men to get into line to meet the next charge seeing this a part of the famous old glee club our dear old gentry leading began singing rally round the flag boys rally once again i rode straight up to where they were and joined in singing rally once again as i waved the bloodstained flag and my darling overpowered defeated cut to pieces starving captured as we were those that were left of us formed front and north and south and met with sullen desperation their double onset with the members of my own staff and the general officers and their staff officers we compelled a rally and stand of corses brigade and w h f lees cavalry who made one of the most brilliant cavalry fights of the war enabling many of us to escape capture our loss in killed and wounded was heavy and yet my darling with all the odds against us we might possibly have held out till night which was fast approaching but that our ammunition was exhausted we yielded to an overwhelming force sheridans cavalry alone numbering more than double my whole command with warrens infantry corps to back them ah my sally the triumphs of might are transient but the sufferings and crucifixions for the right can never be forgotten the sorrow and song of my glorycrowned division nears its doxology may god pity those who wait at home for the soldier who has reported to the great commander god pity them as the days go by and the sad nights follow the birds were hushed in the woods when i started to write and now one calls to its mate cheer up cheer up lets listen and obey the birds my darling lets try to cheer up cheer up i remember that milton said those who best bear his mild yoke they serve him best lets bear and serve him best my darling wife faithfully your soldier tomorrow my darling may see our flag furled forever jackerie our faithful old mailcarrier sobs behind me as i write he bears tonight this his last message from me as our cupid first he is commissioned with three orders which i know you will obey as fearlessly as the bravest of your brother soldiers keep up a stout heart believe that i shall come back to you and know that god reigns after tonight you will be my whole command staff field officers men all the second commission is only given as a precaution lest i should not return or lest for some time i should not be with you lees surrender is imminent it is finished through the suggestion of their commanding officers as many of the men as desire are permitted to cut through and join johnstons army the cloud of despair settled over all on the third when the tidings came to us of the evacuation of richmond and its partial loss by fire the homes and families of many of my men were there and all knew too well that with the fall of our capital the last hope of success was over and yet my beloved these men as resolutely obeyed the orders of their commanding officers as if we had captured and burned the federal capital the horrors of the march from five forks to amelia court house and thence to sailors creek beggars all description for forty eight hours the man or officer who had a handful of parched corn in his pocket was most fortunate we reached sailors creek on the morning of the sixth weary starving despairing sheridan was in our front delaying us with his cavalry as was his custom until the infantry should come up mahone was on our right ewell on our left mahone was ordered to move on and we were ordered to stand still the movement of mahone left a gap which increased as he went on hugers battalion of artillery in attempting to cross the gap was being swept away when i pushed on with two of my brigades across sailors creek we formed line of battle across an open field holding it against repeated charges of sheridans dismounted cavalry at about three oclock the infantry which sheridan had been looking for came up completely hemming us in anderson ordered me to draw off my brigades to the rear and to cut our way out in any possible manner that we could wises brigade was deployed in the rear to assist us but was charged upon on all sides by the enemy and though fighting manfully to the last was forced to yield two of my brigadiers corse and hunton were taken prisoners the other two barely escaped and my life by some miracle was spared and by another miracle greater still i escaped capture a squadron of the enemys cavalry was riding down upon us two of my staff and myself when a small squad of my men recognized me and risking their own lives rallied to our assistance and suddenly delivered a last volley into the faces of the pursuing horsemen checking them but for a moment but in that one moment we by the speed of our horses made our escape ah my darling the sacrifice of this little band of men is like unto that which was made at calvary it is finished ah my beloved division thousands of them have gone to their eternal home having given up their lives for the cause they knew to be just the others alas heartbroken crushed in spirit are left to mourn its loss well it is practically all over now we have poured out our blood and suffered untold hardships and privations all in vain and now well must not forget either that god reigns life is given us for the performance of duty and duty performed is happiness it is finished the suffering the horrors the anguish of these last hours of struggle the glorious gift of your love will help me to bear the memory of them in this midnight hour i feel the caressing blessing of your pure spirit as it mingles with mine peace is born from now forever only your soldier suckley and i arrived safely after an interesting but to me sad trip because of the many sorrowful memories that it brought back ingalls bless his old loyal heart met us at the train and took us up in the quartermasters carriage it is the first time that i have ridden in one of uncle sams vehicles since i changed colors and donned the gray and now i ride not as an owner but as a guest again my darling there came tome memories of the has been and might have been well george said rufus this looks kind of natural doesnt it old man but before i could reply intuitively sensing what i was feeling he continued hurriedly and this rig is at your service all the time you are here the three of us had dinner together pitcher whom youve heard me speak of as 01d jug came over from his table and joined us at dessert after dinner all four of us went to the theater to hear billy florence we sent a line in to him from our box and when he came out he strode across the stage and looking directly at us said in his most tragic tone and manner the lamb and the lion shall lie down together and then went on with his part he knew and we knew but the audience didnt he played to us too all evening and never played better after the play we went behind the scenes and had a charming visit with mrs florence who graciously gave her consent to billys going out to supper with us and by the way general pickett said mrs florence how is that beautiful mrs edwards with whom i saw you in montreal and with whom you were so much in love and who come to think of it won all our hearts poor ellen tree was talking about her the last time i saw her and how is that laughing brighteyed baby who made a drum of himself and a prancing steed of everybody elses cane i can see him now with his mass of ringlets and his sparkling laughing eyes he had just learned to walk and yet was charging the enemy on his fiery steed beating an imaginary drum and blowing an imaginary fife it was the funniest thing i ever saw i told mrs florence that we had returned to the states that little george could ride areal horse now and beat a real drum and that i was just as much as ever in love with mrs edwards who had become so attached to her assumed name that she hated to give it up and insisted that we should now and then call each other mr and mrs edwards to keep in memory the sweet allbelonging life we spent with each other in canada we had a fine steamedoyster supper at harveys and told stories and talked of old times till after two oclock i got up this morning just in time to go to twelve oclock breakfast at the club with rufus after breakfast we went as arranged to see grant i just cant tell you my darling about that visit youll have to wait till i see you to tell you how the warmhearted modest old warrior and loyal old friend met me how he took in his the hand of your heart sore soldier poor broken defeated profession gone and looking at him for a moment without speaking said slowly pickett if there is anything on the top of gods green earth that i can do for you say so just then his orderly apologetically brought in a card to him tell sheridan to go to yis surh ill till him surh and go there yourself yis surh ill go surh rufus who was whistling over at the window reiterated grants order receiving from the orderly the same assurance yis surh ill till him surh while sheridan was obeying grants order and going to his new station we three sat down and had a hearttoheart conference one listening would never have known that we had been on opposite sides of any question when i started to go grant pulled down a chequebook and said pickett it seems funny doesnt it that i should have any money to offer but how much do you need not any old fellow not a cent thank you i said i have plenty but rufus tells me that you have begun to build a house to take the place of the one old butler burned and how can you build it without money you do need some i have sold some timber to pay for it i told him and to show my appreciation and gratitude unobserved i affectionately squeezed his leg when he called out rufus its the same old george pickett instead of pulling my leg hes squeezing it grant is going to take rufus suckley and myself to ride this afternoon to show me the changes since i was last here years ago tomorrow if all goes well ill start back to what is worth more to me than all ive lost my precious wife who was as queenly and gracious and glorious as mrs edwards in one room in a boarding house in exile as she was in petersburg in a palatial home when her husband was the department commander and she had not only vassals and slaves at her side but the general commanding and all his soldiers and our world at her feet your devoted soldier so you would leave it all to my better judgment most wise little one and would not advise me but after i had decided fully i was to read the mysterious sealed note not to be opened till after you have decided at the banquet last night i opened and read the letter and then passed it over to general e p alexander general ingalls and doctor suckley they all shook their heads disapprovingly i pointed to the instructions not to be opened till after you have decided and said that i had already decided and the note only showed that we are two souls with but a single thought now dont you know my darling that i knew your opinion before just as well as after i had read your sealed letter of course i knew that you did not want me to go and that as you prettily put it weve had glory enough and war enough with its hardships and separations and dangers and now we just want each other forever and forevermore yes my darling we want each other and a home with a spiked fence around it and a key to the road gate for us alone just us forever and forevermore my friends all think that i am making a great mistake in refusing this magnanimous offer of the khedive they hold that i am sacrificing my future and signing the death warrant to ambition and success general alexander has accepted and will take command of the egyptian armies egypt could not have a finer officer last night at the farewell dinner the khedives last telegram was handed to the commissioner forward pickett at any cost it was a most flattering compliment and i have asked permission to keep it for our boy the boy might think you were a brand of powder or a keg of nails said ingalls who by the way is disgusted at my refusal but my beautiful wife he has not you and love such as yours is worth all the gold and glory of the universe tomorrow i shall take the steamer for home without one regret for having decided as i have just you and i just ourselves forever and forever your soldier it is thursday and the cottage is so empty so desolate without my darling even rufus feels the absence of its beautiful mistress and a few minutes ago to show his sympathy for his lonesome master brought and laid on my knee a little slipper which if i did not know it belonged to my own fairy princess would make me think that another cinderella with a tinier foot had also forgotten the midnight hour i gave no evidence of my appreciation of his effort to comfort me and rufus trotted off and brought me the other slipper good dog i said good dog patting him on the head then fondling the little slippers and putting them be 1 the old ancestral home called by the federal soldiers turkey bend is in henrico co which is one of the original shires into which virginia was divided in 1634 side me i took up my pencil and pad to tell you all about it presently looking around i saw rufus planning to bring me everything in the room belonging to you he has a lot of dog sense and i tried to make him understand that the slippers had been sufficiently effective in consoling me but he would not be convinced until i whistled our song believe me if all those endearing young charms then trying to howl an accompaniment and failing he wagged his tail lay down at my feet and went to sleep every day when i come in to dinner he trots up in front of your picture and barks till i take it down then looking down at it barks again while i encourage him saying tell her all about it old man tell her all about it when he has told you about it he lies down beside it his paw on the frame wagging his tail and looking up at me till he thinks i have shown sufficient appreciation of his admiration and devotion to you and then he jumps up and points and barks at the place on the rack from which it was taken until it is duly kissed and replaced oh hes a great dog little one and great company for me but both he and i and everything else are lonesome for you and we have promised our souls that when you come back we will vie with each other in our efforts to make you happy already the hens have commenced laying again the butter is piling up to be made into cakes and good things your new little calf is a beauty but i shall send him off and sell him before you get back for you would never allow him to be separated from his mother and would let him go on extracting her milk till he was a man you great tenderhearted darling the corn and wheat are beautiful the vegetables fine and the flowers we planted all breathe of your purity and sweetness the cutting from the poe rosebush which mrs allen gave us is full of buds so you see everything above the ground and in the ground at our turkey island home is waiting for your blessing this morning i took my gun and rufus and killed five partridges and two rabbits i gave one rabbit to mr sims and one to uncle tom the birds i sent to lizzie as i was coming on home i stopped and rested in the cool and calm of the forest beside the old gray broken monument where we have so often made love and told each other fairy tales and wandered about and made thought pictures of our william and mary randolph who erected it away back in 1771 i wonder little one if from their celestial home they can see the picturesque beauty which i see and which i wish i could put into words do you remember the inscription on one of the sides of the monument the foundation of this pillar was laid in 1771 when all the great rivers of this country were swept by inundations never before experienced which changed the face of nature and left traces of their violence that will remain for ages as i read over this inscription i feel sorry that the thought to erect a monument to commemorate any kind of disaster should ever have been born times soothing wings bless always and not only have the ravages of the flood which this monument was erected to commemorate been long ago forgotten but the memories of ravages and horrors of a yesterday far far more terrible are thank god being effaced the birds are nesting and songs are being born just where butlers vandals mutilated and broke off the top of this monument hunting for hidden treasure some of the seeds which the mother birds carried to their young have fallen by the wayside and taken root and now out of the jagged broken top grow a greenery of unknown vines and plants and flowers the old colonial home of my forefathers with its rare old mahoganies and paintings which butler sacked and desecrated and then burned has been replaced by a sweet little cottage home built by ourselves all our very own and consecrated to love and contentment with furnishings so simple and plain that we are not afraid of using them no my sweetheart we dont want any monuments to mark any of the woes and horrors of the past we must build one of hope and faith and peace and mercy and joy the foundation of which is already laid in our hearts listen i hear old sims step on the porch i hear him knocking his pipe against the pillars so a dios he will tell me the same old stories over again and i shall listen and laugh as though i heard them for the first time dear old sims good night sweet dreams angels guard you while i hear of lafayette and nelson and marshall through the clouds of old sims tobacco smoke for the hundredth yes thousandth time your lonesome soldier you are always right my darling sally and your husband is only right when he is guided by you pretty generally he listens to his oracle and when he doesnt he wishes to the lord he had the morning i left when you urged that i wear the suit i had been wearing and i claimed that i hadnt time to change then please take it with you and change on the boat you plead well dearest i was mean i wouldnt and i didnt and your obstinate soldier was not out of sight of the sweet lone figure standing on the wharf waving to him the love signals and the godspeed of our code before he was abusing himself as an ingrate in refusing anything that the sweetest most beautiful woman and the best wife in the world could ask of him well dem dat dances is bleeged ter pay de fiddler and your husband is paying he is being punished for he caught cold on the boat had a chill followed by sore throat and pain in limbs and back i stopped only a day in petersburg to see our agent there then came over here went to the exchange and went directly to bed and sent for dr beal he has been very attentive coming twice a day julia and wash took me in charge at once and as usual areas good as gold and so is everyone as to that but each and all in turn prescribe a sure remedy and urge my taking it that settled it and i compromised on the hot scotch but i was firm and would not yield to julias entreaties to be permitted to bring me mrs marshalls flannel petticoat to wrap around my throat what would the judge say i asked yesterday when i wrote i did not tell you how sick i had been or was nor how lonesome nor how i longed for your soothing gentle touch your ministering care i should only have made you anxious you could not have come to me oh my sweetheart i think of you all the time and i swear every time i leave you that ill never leave you again that if business calls i must take my darling with me if i could only lay the treasures of the universe at your tiny little feet but this business im afraid will not earn my cough drops or your violets and oh darling it is such a crucifixion you dont know how abhorrent it is to me i spur myself on all the time with this thought that it is for my darling the day i came up on the boat i took out two policies one for 7000 and one for 10000 the men were both old soldiers belonging to my dear old division and one of them said they had to run me down and almost tie me to make me insure their lives you know dear i cant do it id sooner face a cannon than ask a man to take out a policy with me your soldier is nothing but a soldier the war is over and he is no more account the company tells me that my agents must do the soliciting but ill feel like a thief to take a commission on what they have worked for and earned yesterday when i came through petersburg i went as i told you to our office j b b our companys agent was sitting with his chair tilted back foot on the table smoking a bad smelling pipe and reading macaria hello general hello he said not rising sent in six policies this week old man on your familiarity or courtly manners which neither old man on gall gall old man gall and grub come have a drink ever read macaria with the most studied politeness and coldness i declined his offer and in my most dignified manner asked permission to look over the companys books come whats eating you old man he asked bringing his chair down with a bang and slapping me on the back then he profanely informed me that id have to unbuckle a few holes and thaw out if i wanted to paint the monkeys tail skyblue alas little one i am afraid your soldier isnt much of an artist he longs to give his precious wife all the luxuries and comforts and everything that is beautiful but he cant thaw out my darling and he cant paint that monkeys tail skyblue and sweetheart it makes me crawl and creep to be associated with artists who can i was wondering as i came over whether it would be better to send our boy to west point or get him a paintbrush we have time to decide that however for he is just a little over eleven here comes the colonel and old mistiss and by the way everybody sends love and messages to you and our boy now my own beautiful wife dont be anxious about me and forgive this long rambling letter its snowing hard i mean easy the snow is beautiful but im so homesick for you your loving goodfornothing soldier all the way to the station my darling i was asking myself whether i was right in yielding to your solicitations and leaving our sick child with all the resulting care and responsibility resting on your everbrave shoulders and once sweetheart after thinking very seriously over it i was almost tempted to turn and go back when the appealing words of your voice echoed through my soul even if i knew our child would die while you were gone i would not have you neglect this call to honor your boys whom you led to their death and instead of turning back i said drive faster please john david i wouldnt miss my train for anything you blessed little sermon i made the train in plenty of time and your mother to whom i had telegraphed at ivor came to the station bringing the good tidings that your brother was out of danger i did not tell her that our little george was ill lest it might make her anxious and i knew that her duty was beside her sick boy your brother i would have been so thankful if you my sweet beautiful bride and our precious little warbaby could have come with me everybody asks about you and the boy and sends love and expresses sorrow that you could not come a delegation of my old soldiers met me at the station and though some of our relatives had prepared to have us with them i agreed to the arrangement of the committee and the demand of the governor and was taken to the executive mansion as the guest of the state all the evening and the next morning until it was time to form old comrades came in in groups and single file they told of their experiences officers and privates alike discussed the pennsylvania campaign and the three days fight their voices falling to a whisper as they spoke of those whose memory we had come to honor our gallant dead at gettysburg our brave boys who gave their last full measure of devotion to duty i had been made chief marshal a sad solemn sacred office for me of all the army such love such reverence was christborn you cannot conceive of it from the old market to the cemetery of hollywood the streets sidewalks windows and housetops were crowded there must have been twelve thousand people at hollywood such a demonstration of devotion and sympathy was i think never before witnessed on earth think of it my darling so penetrating so universal a oneness of love and respect and reverence existed that there was a stillness an awesomeness save for those necessary sounds the clanking of swords the tramp of horses and the martial tread of men keeping time with funeral marches the solemn requiem no cheers no applause only loving greetings from tearstained faces heads bent in reverence clasped hands held out to us as we passed along as i saw once more the couragelit faces of my brave virginians again i heard their cry well follow you marse george from their eternal silence those who marched heroically to death looked down upon us yesterday and were sad my darling you cannot know no you cannot know as i clasped the hand of one after another of those who crowded around me i was greeted with the words my husband was killed at gettysburg my son is lying there among the dead my brother was with you there and he has just come back tome so many crushed hearts filling my heart with grief oh my sally if the cry of my soul had been voiced it would have been the echo of that at gethsemane after the services general joseph r anderson had a number of us old fellows come to his house and as we stood around his sumptuous board the solemnity of the scene was almost like that of the lords supper though we were old soldiers neither the march nor the battle was mentioned the only wartime reference was that some of my men called me by the old wartime title marse george among the guests were some of our west point comrades whose only vocation like mine was war our tents are folded now and we parted going off each to his work one to the farm another to the trade one to seek some position one to one place one to another and i to return to my beautiful wife and my sick baby my only joy and my life knowing that what is best will come your loving soldier poor broken lily i hated so to leave you the haunted look on your sweet tired face haunts my heart and i was almost tempted to disobey the companys orders and not go the doctor said you were not strong enough to come with your soldier that you were all run down by your long watch sleepless nights and nursing and then the transplanting of the precious flower into the fathers garden at last having to give the boy back was more than you could bear ah sweetheart try to be generous too and give him to the heavenly father being thankful for his having lent him to you for so long dear beautiful mother of an angel come say thy will be done and try to recognize the wisdom of our lord see my lily how well your soldier has learned his lesson it was you who taught him to believe to look up and trust come now take your spelling book and let him teach you the word how tenderly loyally reverently i do love you my wife and how i want to spare you every hurt ill be starting back when you get this love to our boy and tell him to look after his dear mother for his dear father that he is our little man and has got double duty to do from now on ask him to think about what he wants for his birthday anything but a gun he can have think my darling nearly eleven years of perfect bliss such happiness as man never had god show me how to be worthy of such a wife the horses are at the door my little one i must say a dios lovingly and forever and ever your soldier
