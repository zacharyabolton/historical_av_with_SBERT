the detractors of general longstreets military integrity assert that being opposed to fighting an offensive battle at gettysburg he was balky and stubborn in executing lees orders that he disobeyed the commanding generals orders to attack at sunrise on the morning of july 2 that again ordered to attack with half the army on the morning of july 3 his culpably slow attack with only picketts division supported by some of hills troops caused the fatal confederate defeat in that encounter general gordon has seen fit in a recent publication to revive this cruel aspersion when general longstreet surrendered his sword at appomattox his war record was made up it stands unassailableneeding no defenders back of the day that opened so auspiciously for the confederate cause at the first manassas and of the four years that followed lies the record of a quarter of a century in the union army in those times general longstreet at cerro gordo molino del rey and chapultepec was aiding to win the great empire of the west in subsequent hard indian campaigns lighting the fagots of a splendid western civilization adding new glory to american arms and in the struggles of a nation that fell a new star of the first magnitude to the galaxy of american valor completing one of the most lustrous pages in the worlds war history that page cannot be dimmed or darkened it rests secure in its own white splendor above the touch of detractors general longstreet has of late years deemed it unnecessary to make defence of his military integrity save such as may be found in his memoirs manassas to appomattox published nearly ten years since he has held that his deeds stand on the impartial pages of the nations recordstheir own defender the cold historian of our civil war of a hundred years hence will not go for truth to the picturesque reminiscences of general john b gordon nor to the pyrotechnics of general fitzhugh lee nor yet to the somewhat hysterical ravings of rev mr pendleton and scores of other modern essayists who have sought to fix the failure of gettysburg upon general longstreet the coming chronicler will cast aside the rubbish of passion and hate that followed the war and have recourse to the nations official war records and in the cool calm lights of the letters and reports of the participants written at the time will place the blunder of gettysburg where it belongs longstreets fame has nothing to fear in that hour but for the benefit of the presentof the young the busy who have neither time nor inclination to study the records and for that sentiment that is increasingly shaped by the public pressfor these and other reasons it appears fitting that in this hour historical truth should have a spokesman on the gettysburg contentions in the absence of one more able to speak this little story of the truth is written the writer belongs to a generation that has come up since the gloom of appomattox closed the drama of the great lost cause of american historya generation that seeks the truth unwarped and undistorted by passion and can face the truth in the prosecution of my researches for the origin of the extraordinary calumnies aimed at general longstreets honor as a soldier two most significant facts have continually pressed upon my attention first not one word appears to have been published openly accusing him of disobedience at gettysburg until the man who could forever have silenced all criticism was in his graveuntil the knightly soul of robert edward lee had passed into eternity second general longstreets operations on the field of gettysburg were above the suspicion of reproach until he came under the political ban in the south for meeting in the proper spirit as he saw it the requirements of good citizenship in the observance of his appomattox parole and after the removal of his political disabilities for having accepted office at the hands of a republican president who happened to be his old west point comradegrant then the storm broke he was heralded as traitor deserter of his people deserter of democracy etc in the fury of this onslaught originated the cruel slander that he had disobeyed lees most vital orders causing the loss of the gettysburg battle and the ultimate fall of the confederate cause most singularly this strange discovery was not made until some years after the battle and general lees death thereafter for two decades the south was sedulously taught to believe that the federal victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the culpable disobedience of general longstreet the sectional complaint that he deserted democracy is about as relevant and truthful as the assertion that he lost gettysburg he was a west pointer a professional soldier he had never cast a ballot before the civil war he had no politics its passions and prejudices had no dwellingplace in his mind the war was over and he quietly accepted the result fraternizing with all americans it was no great crime but the peculiar circumstances favored an opportunity to make longstreet the longdesired scapegoat for gettysburg there was an ulterior and deeper purpose however than merely besmirching his military record shortsighted partisans seemingly argued that the disparagement of longstreet was necessary to save the military reputation of lee but lees great fame needed no such sacrifice the outrageous charges against longstreet have been wholly disproved much of the partisan rancor that once pursued him has died out many of the more intelligent southerners have been long convinced that he was the victim of a great wrong it was unworthy of majorgeneral john b gordon once of the army of northern virginia to revive this dead controversy he simply reiterates the old charges in full produces no evidence in their support and gratuitously endorses a false and cruel verdict his contribution is of no historical value it carries inherent evidence that general gordon made no critical examination of the documentary history of gettysburg he assumes to render a verdict on the sayso of others gordons unsupported assertions would require no attention but for one fact both south and north there is a widespread impression that gordon was a conspicuous figure at gettysburg this is erroneous he was merely a brigade commander there stationed five miles from longstreet it is not certain that he personally saw either lee or longstreet while the army was in pennsylvania in his official report gordon uses this language regarding the operations of his own small command at gettysburg when the heaviest fighting was going on finely showing the scope of his opportunities for observation it is but just to gordon however to say that in his subordinate capacity at the head of one of the thirtyseven brigades of infantry comprising lees army he performed excellent service on the first days battle but in estimating his value as a personal witness the foregoing undisputed facts must be taken into consideration his testimony is obviously of the hearsay kind in fact as will be observed from his own admission it is no more than his own personal conclusions wholly deduced from the assertions of others based on an assumed state of facts which did not exist it is competent to point out that longstreets orders from general lee were to move around to gain the emmitsburg road on the enemys left in short he was to attack up the emmitsburg road as all the authorities agree he therefore could not well occupy little round top up the emmitsburg road because it was but a fraction less than a mile to the east of that road it is as clear as noonday that lee had no thought at first if ever that little round top was the key to the position lee merely contemplated driving the enemy from some high ground on the emmitsburg road from which the more elevated ground of cemetery hill in its rear more than a mile to the northward of little round top could be subsequently assailed lees luminous report of the battle dated july 31 1863 only four weeks after has escaped gordons notice or has been conveniently ignored by him it is found at page 305 et seq of part ii vol xxvii of the printed war records easily accessible to everybody at page 308 lees report the desired ground captured was that held by sickless federal third corpsthe celebrated peachorchard wheatfield and adjacent high ground from which cemetery hill was next day assailed by the confederate artillery as a prelude to picketts infantry assault it was the crest of the ridge not the round top that lee wished to assail his eye from the first appears to have been steadily fixed upon the federal centre that is why he ordered the attack up the emmitsburg road lieutenantgeneral r h anderson then of hills corps also makes this definite statement but general lee persisted in the direct attack up the emmitsburg road hood deployed on longstreets extreme right at once perceived that the true direction was by flank against the southern slopes of big round top he delayed the advance to advise of the discovery he had made soon the positive order came back general lees orders are to attack up the emmitsburg road he still hesitated and repeated the suggestion again it was reiterated general lees orders are to attack up the emmitsburg road then the troops moved to the attack there was no alternative lees orders were imperative and made after he had personally examined the enemys position longstreet was ordered to attack a specific position up the emmitsburg road which was not little round top as assumed by gordon this point is particularly elaborated because in it lies the milk in the cocoanut of the charges against longstreet without consulting the records gordon has merely followed the lead of some of general lees biographers notably fitzhugh lee who asserts that his illustrious uncle expected longstreet to seize little round top on the 2d of july the records clearly show that nothing was farther from general lees thoughts after the war it was discovered that a very early attack on little round top would perhaps have found it undefended hence the afterthought that general longstreet was ordered to attack at sunrise but whatever the hour longstreet was ordered to attack it was most certainly not little round top that was made his objective general longstreets personal account of this magnificent battle up the emmitsburg road will not be out of place here in the newspaper article previously quoted from he very graphically describes the advance of the two divisions of mclaws and hood for when he went into battle it must be understood that even yet one of his divisions that of pickett was still absent he states his total force at thirteen thousand men an account of this clash of arms must send a thrill of pride through every southern heart surely these are not the utterances of one who had been slow balky and obstructive on that field the ring of these sentences tells no tale of apathy or backwardness because his advice to pursue a different line of operations had been ignored by lee general gordon continuing very complacently assumes that two of the largest corps of meades army would not have been in the fight of the 2d had longstreet attacked early in the morning he refers to the union fifth and sixth corps that statement is correct only as regards the sixth corps which it is true did not arrive on the field until late in the afternoon but it took only a slight part at dark on the 2d when the battle was over indeed as it was so slightly engaged the hour of its arrival at gettysburg is unimportant the losses of the different corps conclusively show what part the sixth which was the largest in the army took in the battle of the 2d of july as given in the rebellion records killed and wounded first corps 3980 second corps 3991 third corps 3662 fifth corps 1976 sixth corps 212 eleventh corps 2353 twelfth corps 1016 its nonparticipation strongly militates against the spirit of gordons argument in that meade entirely frustrated lees plans and defeated the confederate army scarcely using the sixth corps some fifteen thousand men at all this is a significant commentary on the antilongstreet assumption of how easy it was to win at gettysburg if only longstreet had obeyed orders at sunrise on the 2d the hour at which longstreets critics would have had this attack delivered the federal fifth corps was as near the battleground of that day as longstreets troops longstreets troops were bivouacked the night previous at marsh creek four miles west of gettysburg they began to arrive near lees headquarters on seminary ridge not earlier than 7 am of the 2d and the last of the column did not get in until near noon then they were still five miles by the route pursued from the chosen point of attack the union fifth corps was bivouacked five miles east of gettysburg about the same hour on the 1st that longstreets tired infantry reached marsh creek at four oclock am of the 2d they marched on gettysburg arriving about the same hour that longstreets troops were being massed near lees headquarters and were thereupon posted upon the extreme federal right upon the first manifestation of confederate movements on the right and left we know that the fifth corps was immediately drawn in closer and about nine oclock massed at the bridge over rock creek on the baltimore pike ready for developments meade thought lee intended to attack his right that lee contemplated it is quite certain colonel venable of his staff was sent about sunrise to consult with lieutenantgeneral ewell upon the feasibility of a general attack from his front lee wanted ewells views as to the advisability of moving all the available troops around to that front for such a purpose venable and ewell rode from point to point to determine if this should be done finally venable says lee himself came to ewells lines and eventually the design for an attack on the union right was abandoned where the fifth corps was finally massed it was only one and a half miles in the rear of general sickless position moreover it had an almost direct road to that point this facility for reinforcing incidentally illustrates the advantages of the union position at the same hour general longstreets troops were still massed near the chambersburg pike three miles on a straight line from the point of attack that is to say longstreet had twice as far to march on an airline to strike sickles up the emmitsburg road as sykes had to reinforce the threatened point but in fact sykess advantage was far greater in point of time because by order of lee longstreet was compelled to move by back roads and lanes out of sight of the enemys signal officers on round top his troops actually marched six or seven miles to reach the point of deployment longstreet eventually attacked about 4 pm and the fifth corps was used very effectively against him but no historian who esteems the truth with the undisputed records before him will deny that it could and would have been used just as effectively at seven or eight oclock in the morning the moment longstreets movement was detected it was immediately hurried over to the left and occupied round top if longstreet had moved earlier the fifth corps also would have moved earlier it could have been on sickless left and rear as early as seven oclock am had it been necessary if ewell and not longstreet had delivered the general attack it would have been found in his front it is mathematically correct to say that the troops which met longstreet on the afternoon of the 2d could have been brought against him in the morning the reports of general meade general sykes the commander of the fifth corps of sykess brigade and regimental commanders and various other documentary history bearing on the subject are convincing upon this point general sickless advance was made in consequence of the confederate threatening and would have been sooner or later according as that threatening was made the critics ignore this fact general longstreet says on this point so much for one part of gordons assumption based upon other assumptions founded upon an erroneous presumption that if longstreet had taken wings and flown on an airline from his bivouac at marsh creek to the federal left and attacked at sunrise he would have found no enemy near the round tops in another equally unwarranted assumption of what the impartial military critic will consider an established fact gordon declares lee himself mentions no such order in his final report penned six months afterwards he merely mentions that the general plan was unchanged and longstreet reinforced ordered to attack next morning no definite hour being fixed it is significant however that in his letter to jefferson davis from the field dated july 4 lee uses this language the third division was picketts which did not arrive from chambersburg until 9 am of the 3d in the same report lee himself states that pickett with three of his brigades joined longstreet the following morning there is no dispute however about the hour of picketts arrival so that as pickett was selected by lee to lead the charge and as lee knew exactly where pickett was it is morally impossible that it was fixed for daylight five hours before picketts troops were up in one place lee remarks in his report the morning was occupied in necessary preparations and the battle recommenced in the afternoon of the 3d time was not an essential element in the problem of the 3d the federal army was then all up whereas picketts confederate division was still absent the delay of a few hours was therefore a distinct gain for the confederates and not prejudicial as gordon would have the world believe clearly this shows that longstreet had no orders for the morning of july 3 as longstreets report passed through lees hands the superior would most certainly have returned it to the subordinate for correction if there were errors in it this he did not do neither did lee indorse upon the document itself any dissent from its tenor as pickett did not come up until 9 am and as general lee says the morning was occupied in necessary preparations it was logistically and morally impossible to make an attack at daylight and general longstreet states that it could not have been delivered sooner than it was finally longstreet emphatically denies that lee ordered him to attack at daylight on the 3d he says that he had no orders of any kind on that morning until lee personally came over to his front and ordered the pickett charge no early attack was possible under the conditions imposed by lee to use picketts pettigrews and penders troops widely separated but without any orders from lee as is quite apparent longstreet had already given orders for a flank attack by the southern face of big round top as an alternative to directly attacking again the impregnable heights from which he had been repulsed the night before that would have been simple madness to quote the language of the confederate general law but such an act of simple madness was the only daylight attack possible from longstreets front on the morning of the 3d lee substituted for the feasible early attack projected by longstreet the pickett movement straight on cemetery heights which it required hours of preparation to fulminate and which proved the most disastrous and destructive in confederate annals it was in fact the deathknell of the southern republic but in his paper of 1877 on gettysburg hereinbefore freely quoted from general longstreet goes more into detail with relation to lees plans and orders for the morning of the 3d and more fully discloses the genesis of the pickett charge in this account his own opposition to a renewal of the attack on cemetery hill is developed and the obvious reasons therefor as he is confirmed in nearly every particular by participants and by the records his account is here reprinted general longstreets description of the pickett charge itself also throws much light on these old controversies it is confirmed in all essential particulars by general alexander and others who have written on the subject since the war and also by the reports continuing on the subject of longstreets alleged disobedience gordon considers the following as another of the facts established this is the old story that longstreet was culpable in not sending mclaws and hood to the attack with pickett but in fact lees own utterances show that mclaws and hood were not to join in the pickett attack but on the contrary were excluded for other vital service by lees specific directions it is true this was done upon longstreets strenuous representations that twenty thousand federals were massed behind the round top to swoop down on the confederate flank if hood and mclaws were withdrawn after viewing the ground himself lee acquiesced the eyewitnesses quoted by gordon heard only the original order they evidently did not know of its necessary modification after lee was made aware by his own personal observations and by longstreets explanations that it was impossible to withdraw hood and mclaws the official reports of both lee and longstreet are conclusive on this point and they substantially agree in the paragraph quoted in the preceding chapter longstreet states explicitly that the commanding general joined me on the far right on the morning of the 3d and ordered a column of attack to be formed of picketts heths and part of penders divisions etc if this was a misstatement why did not lee correct it before sending the report to the war department he did not on the contrary lee corroborates longstreet in these paragraphs of his own official report in which he also explains in detail why mclaws and hood were not ordered forward with pickett now one of lees favorite officers general pickett had personal supervision of the formation of the attacking column general lee was for a time personally present while this work was going on conversing with pickett concerning the proper dispositions and making various suggestions he therefore knew by personal observation before the charge was made exactly what troops were included and what were not he knew that the extreme right of hoods division was at that moment fully three miles away holding a difficult position in face of an overwhelming force of federals and mclaws almost equally distant with these documents before him how can gordon believe it an established fact that lee expected mclaws and hood to take part in the pickett charge it is admitted by almost if not quite all authority on the subject that picketts charge was hopeless the addition of mclaws and hood would not have increased the chances of success the confederates under longstreet and r h anderson had tested the enemys position on that front thoroughly in the battle of the 2d and with a much larger force including these same divisions of mclaws and hood who had been repulsed there was every reason to believe that the position was much stronger on the final day than when longstreet attacked it on the 2d the troops of hood and mclaws in view of their enormous losses were in no condition to support pickett effectively even had they been free for that purpose but it has been shown above by the testimony of both lee and longstreet that they were required to maintain the position they had won in the desperate struggle of the evening previous to prevent the twentytwo thousand men of the union fifth and sixth corps from falling en masse upon picketts right flank or their own flank and rear had they moved in unison with pickett the first positive utterance holding general longstreet responsible for the defeat at gettysburg through failure to obey lees orders came from rev dr william n pendleton an episcopal clergyman of virginia on the 17th of january 1873 general lee had then been dead more than two years in view of what follows it is well to bear in mind these two distinct dates there had been some vague hints particularly among some of the higher exconfederates from virginia prior to pendletons categorical story but pendleton was the first person to distinctly formulate the indictment against longstreet for disobedience of orders in an address delivered in the town of lexington virginia on the date mentioned in behalf of a memorial church to general lee pendleton uses this language referring to the battle of gettysburg rev dr pendleton was a brigadiergeneral and chief of artillery on lees staff he was a graduate of west point and was the cadet friend of lee for more than three years in the military academy after the war they were closely associated at lexington virginia his fulmination had the effect of a bombshell there was a hue and cry at once corroborative evidence of the easy hearsay sort was forthcoming from various interested quarters but most markedly and noisily from the state of virginia as if by preconcert pendletons fulmination appeared to have been expected by those who had previously been pursuing longstreet the late general jubal a early was particularly strenuous in unreserved endorsement of the pendleton story the rev j william jones of richmond the selfappointed conservator of general lees fair fame also quickly added his testimony to the reliability of the rev dr pendletons discovery and dramatic disclosure those who approved generally fortified pendleton with additional statements of their own pendletons statement is characteristic of the whole but it was for a time the more effective because it was more definite in that it purported to recite a positive statement by lee of an alleged order to longstreet if pendletons statement falls the whole falls general longstreet was astounded when pendletons lexington story was brought to his attention he had previously paid but little attention to indefinite gossip of a certain coterie that he had been slow and even obstructive at gettysburg and had never heard before that he was accused of having disobeyed a positive order to attack at any given hour that false accusation aroused him to action he categorically denied pendletons absurd allegations and at once appealed to several living members of lees staff and to others in a position to know the facts to exonerate him from the charge of having disobeyed his chief thereby causing disaster colonel walter h taylor a virginian and general lees adjutantgeneral promptly responded as follows the fact that colonel taylor was himself a somewhat severe critic of general longstreet through a misapprehension of certain facts and conditions gives additional force and value to this statement colonel charles marshall then an aide on lees staff who succeeded long as military secretary and subsequently had charge of all the papers left by general lee wrote as follows the statement of general mclaws appeared in a narrative of gettysburg published in a savannah paper nearly thirty years ago besides its direct bearing on the pendleton story it furnishes valuable information as to some of the causes of delay encountered by longstreets troops in their long march from chambersburg on the 1st of july another letter which in a way is still more important than any of the foregoing is one from colonel john w fairfax a member of general longstreets staff it tends to show that the sunriseorder story was conjured up by dr pendleton and others at lexington after lees death in other words it is strong circumstantial confirmation of general longstreets belief in a conspiracy written more than twentysix years ago the manner in which it dovetails with all the foregoing statements and documents as to the various events involved is peculiarly significant colonel fairfax is a virginian and was always an ardent admirer of general lee but not to the extent of desiring to uphold his fame at the expense of honor or the ruin of another the corps artillery did not get up until nine or ten oclock and part of it not until noon or after picketts division did not begin its march from the vicinity of chambersburg some thirty miles away until the 2d pendletons report herein quoted shows how the artillery was delayed and the deterrent effect that delay had upon longstreets advance after he received the order pendleton himself was the chief of artillery and largely responsible for its manuvres after their arrival upon seminary ridge the infantry of hood and mclaws was massed in a field within musket shot of general lees headquarters and there rested until the troops took arms for the march to the point of attack from this point of rest near lees headquarters to the point of attack by the circuitous route selected by pendleton was between five and seven miles so that longstreets infantry the nearest at hand had from nine to eleven miles to march to reach the selected point of attack the greater part of which march by the back roads and ravines to avoid the observation of the enemy was necessarily slow at best and made doubly so by the mistakes of pendletons guides who put the troops upon the wrong routes the artillery still back on the chambersburg road did not all get up until noon causing a further delay of the whole column as shown by the pendleton report general laws brigade marching from 3 am arrived about noon after they came up all movements were still several hours delayed awaiting lees personal reconnoissances on the left and right to determine the point of attack colonel venable says that about sunrise he was sent to general ewell on the left to inquire if it were not more feasible to attack in that quarter while he was riding from point to point with ewell lee himself came over to see ewell in person lee did not return to longstreets front until about nine oclock meanwhile his staffofficers pendleton long colonel walker and captain johnston by lees orders had been examining the ground to the right upon lees return from the left he rode far to the right and joined pendleton not until then was the attack on the enemys left by longstreet finally decided upon longstreet said it was not earlier than eleven oclock when he received his orders to move from the time consumed by lee and his staff it was probably later the front of the confederate army was six miles in extent hence matters on the morning of july 2 were not awaiting longstreets movements all that long forenoon everything was still in the air depending upon lees personal examinations and final decisions it is perfectly clear from this indecision on the 2d that lee could not have arrived at a decision the previous night as asserted by pendleton at lexington long after the war the hour the feasibility and point of attack have now been thoroughly discussed mainly from the standpoint of the official records as supplementary to the recitations of the official reports of lee longstreet pendleton and others quoted on these heads it seems desirable to introduce just here general longstreets version of his operations on july 2 published so long ago as 1877 only twelve years after appomattox and two decades before he knew the tenor of pendletons report it was given to the world long before the publication of the official records by the government to which he could therefore have had no access how closely he is confirmed in all essential particulars by the records is marvellous in this regard it is to be noted that in all these controversies his statements have always stood analysis in the light of all the evidence far better than those of his reckless critics the following is useful because it comprehensively sums up from longstreets standpoint all the movements relating to fixing the point and time of his attack the movement and disposition of his troops and other incidents there is even more positive proof than has yet been produced that lee gave no such order as described in pendletons lexington lecture or for an early attack as asserted by gordon now is absolutely proved by an official report of gettysburg penned by general pendleton himself that pendleton was an oral falsifier of history is established by his own hand under date of september 12 1863 only nine weeks after the battle confident in his own rectitude of purpose and conduct and far from being an expert controversialist for he was without guile himself it is not at all singular that the significance of pendletons report in connection with the lexington story should for years have entirely escaped general longstreets notice he knew that the document was printed in its sequence in the gettysburg volumes of the war records and for certain purposes had even quoted from it regarding other questions he was also fully aware that general pendleton had long been distinguished for the unreliability of his memory nevertheless general longstreet had never analyzed the report to the extent of observing that it made ridiculous the reverend gentlemans version of 1873 it is most striking that the extraordinary tenor of this old pendletonian exhumation of the war records office in washington should so long have passed entirely unnoticed by everybody despite the researches of the most industrious it remained for mr leslie j perry one of the historical experts then in charge of the government publication of the union and confederate records of the civil war to point out some nine years ago how glaringly the pendleton report of 1863 stultified the pendleton story of 1873 the immediate result of the exploitation of the pendleton report was the elimination of the sunrise story from the repertory of the antilongstreet crusaders in the subsequent literature of the subject a decided change of tone regarding other allegations was soon perceived more favorable to longstreet general longstreet was astounded by this bald disclosure of his old military associates tergiversation to call it nothing worse for a time after the appearance of the lexington story he had charitably presumed that in an excess of zeal to protect general lees military fame pendleton might really have harbored in good faith the belief that his lexington statements were true but after reading the detailed analysis of the pendleton report and carefully studying the report itself general longstreet speedily arrived at the conclusion that he was the victim of a deliberate conspiracy it is not strange that he found it hard to forgive the conspirators even after becoming fully aware that the world was practically convinced that he had been cruelly misrepresented here is the whole of pendletons celebrated report so far as it bears upon the hour of longstreets attack on the 2d of july nothing is omitted relating to the preliminary movements of longstreets column of attack or that in any manner modifies the tenor of the parts introduced when the rev dr pendleton told that dramatic story to his breathless hearers at lexington in 1873 under pressure of imperative duty had he forgotten the tenor of his official report made in 1863 the story as modified by the prior report forms the greatest anticlimax in all history several decisive facts are disclosed by this unbiassed report 1 instead of being dilatory and obstructive pendleton himself establishes that longstreet was personally exerting himself to hasten forward the very artillery of which he pendleton was the chief 2 as late certainly as eleven oclock if not noon general lee and his staffofficers were still rambling all over a front six miles long yet undetermined either as to the point or proper route of attack according to both pendleton and venable they did not begin this necessary preliminary survey until about sunrise the specific hour at which general lee on the night previous had already ordered longstreet to begin his attack as asserted by pendleton at lexington 3 not until lee and pendleton had devoted the entire forenoon to the examination of the ground did pendleton go to conduct longstreet to the point of attack thereupon decided upon evidently longstreet was not delaying action he was awaiting their motions the following general conclusions upon the state of facts disclosed by pendletons remarkable report are therefore inevitable and unavoidable 1 at sunrise of the 2d general lee himself did not know where to attack he did not know as late as ten or eleven oclock his mind was not fully made up until after he came back from ewells front about nine oclock according to all authorities and had made the final examination on the right general longstreet says he received his orders to move about eleven oclock and this corresponds with pendletons report but if anything it was later rather than earlier 2 these painstaking timeconsuming reconnoissances of the commanding general and his staffofficers the journey of colonel venable to ewell three miles to the left and lees later visit to ewell together with the unavoidable absence of general longstreets troops until late in the morning prove absolutely that lee issued no order for longstreet to attack at any specific hour on july 2 3 longstreets preliminary movements from start to finish were under the personal supervision of lees confidential staffofficer pendleton and the subordinate staffofficers so longstreet has positively stated so has general mclaws and both are confirmed by pendletons report the staff guide caused a loss of three hours by putting the head of mclawss column upon a wrong road this compelled longstreet to hasten matters by assuming personal direction of the movement and pushing hoods division rapidly to the front past mclaws 4 pendletons official utterances make it an established fact that general longstreet made his tremendous and successful attack on july 2 at the earliest moment possible after receiving lees orders to advance under the conditions imposed by leeviz to be conducted to the point of attack by pendleton himself and the other staffofficers thus the misapprehensions respecting longstreets great part at gettysburg were cleared away and a better general understanding of what actually occurred was obtained from the rev mr pendletons report of september 12 1863 few military students now hold that longstreet was in the remotest degree culpable for lees defeat on the contrary most of them severely criticise lees operations from start to finish particularly the hopeless assaults he persisted in making and for the lack of concert it is held generally now that the dreadful result fully justified longstreets protests against attacking the federals in that position and that his suggestion of a turning movement was far more promising of success in all the circumstances it is not only entirely improbable but the developed facts of the battle make it impossible that general lee died believing that he lost gettysburg at last by longstreets disobedience of orders longstreet disobeyed no orders at gettysburg and lee was well aware of the fact general gordon has simply reiterated the claque set up after lees death by his fond admirers to shift the responsibility of defeat from his shoulders upon longstreet it was necessary to the success of that folly to make the world believe lee always quietly held that view and only imparted it in the strictest confidence to close friends like the exarmy chaplain rev j william jones and the rev william n pendleton the evidence is totally insufficient its gauzy character is fully exposed by the pendleton report but apocryphal afterwar evidence of this kind was the only reliance of the conspirators it is absolutely certain that there is no evidence of any such belief in any of lees official utterances during the progress of the war nor a hint of it in his private correspondence then or afterwards so far as has been produced the whole superstructure of the contention is based solely on the statements since the war and since lees death of two or three obscure individuals pendletons lexington yarn is an example they are easily exploded by the records of the battle they are corroborated by none all the battle worthy the name for the southern cause at gettysburg on the 2d and 3d was made by longstreet another evidence of the falsehoods concerning longstreets disobedience and lees alleged belief is found in the relations of the two men their personal friendship continued after gettysburg as it was before it was of the closest and most cordial description general lee always manifested the highest regard for general longstreet and continued to manifest undiminished confidence in his military capacity fighting qualities and subordination there is no manifestation of a withdrawal of that confidence after gettysburg i here cite a few illustrations of their relations after gettysburg just after his corps was ordered to reinforce bragg before chattanooga longstreet wrote lee from richmond where he had temporarily stopped on his journey to the new field after the battle of chickamauga lee wrote to longstreet these letters printed in the official records were written less than ninety days after the battle of gettysburg i want you badly does not indicate that longstreet had ever failed general lee they are significant words so soon after the event wherein longstreet by mere obstinacy and obduracy had defeated his chiefs plans if we may believe gordon pendleton and jones after the forlorn campaign in east tennessee against overwhelming numbers when general longstreet was on his way back to the army of northern virginia with his troops to aid in repelling grant lees adjutantgeneral wrote him as follows at gordonsville or orange courthouse while general longstreet held general lee to be a great strategist he thought him to be less able as an offensive battle tactician those views are shared by many other military officers who have of late given free expression to them the gettysburg controversies followed by such criticisms led to the belief that longstreet was the open enemy of lees fame and lost no opportunity to maliciously decry his military ability but this is a mistake general longstreets intimate friends know that he has always born for general lee the most profound love and respect both as a man and as a commander his views of lees military capacity are discriminating and just and they are probably correct longstreet saw things military with a practical eye a fine professional soldier himself who had taken hard knocks on many great fields he clearly discerned general lees incomparable attributes as a commander and was never loath to praise them he also knew lees weaknesses and has sometimes spoken of them but never in malice or contemptuously those who read his utterances in that sense are very narrow indeed he has never like the mass of southerners looked upon lee as infallible yet in one particular longstreet has held him to be one of the very greatest of commanders as an example of general longstreets estimate of lees professional place in history one of his interviews when on a visit to the antietam battlefield published a few years ago is quoted general lee as a rule did not underestimate his opponents or the fighting qualities of the federal troops but after chancellorsville he came to have unlimited confidence in his own army and undoubtedly exaggerated its capacity to overcome obstacles to march to fight to bear up under deprivations and exhaustion it was a dangerous confidence i think every officer who served under him will unhesitatingly agree with me on this point in answer to a question as to which he regarded as lees best battle well perhaps the second battle of manassas was all things considered the best tactical battle general lee ever fought the grand strategy of the campaign was also fine and seems to have completely deceived general pope indeed pope failed to comprehend lees purpose from start to finish pope was outgeneralled and outclassed by lee and through improper dispositions his fine army was outfought still it will not do to underrate pope he was an enterprising soldier and a fighter general longstreet in the interview at antietam summed up lees characteristics as a commander in the following succinct manner general lee was a largeminded man of great and profound learning in the science of war in all strategical movements he handled a great army with comprehensive ability and signal success his campaigns against mcclellan and pope fully illustrate his capacity on the defensive general lee was absolutely perfect reconciled to the single purpose of defence he was invincible but of the art of war more particularly that of giving offensive battle i do not think general lee was a master in science and military learning he was greatly the superior of general grant or any other commander on either side but in the art of war i have no doubt that grant and several other officers were his equals in the field his characteristic fault was headlong combativeness his impatience to strike once in the presence of the enemy whatever the disparity of forces or relative conditions i consider the one weakness of general lees military character this trait of aggressiveness led him to take too many chancesinto dangerous situations at gettysburg all the vast interests at stake and the improbability of success would not deter him in the immediate presence of the enemy general lees mind at all other times calm and clear became excited the same may be said of most other highly educated theoretical soldiers general lee had the absolute confidence of his own troops and the most unquestioning support of his subordinates he was wholesomely feared by the federal rank and file who undoubtedly considered him the easy superior of their own generals these were tremendous advantages it is very difficult to detect malice or hatred in these calm and dispassionate conclusions it is most probable that general longstreet would have never written or uttered one word concerning gettysburg had it not been for the attempt of wordy soldiers to specifically fix upon him the whole burden of that battle their rashness carrying them so far as to lead them to put false orders in the mouth of the great captain and charge longstreet with having broken them to disprove these untrue assertions and to give the world the truth concerning the battle then became what general longstreet considered an imperative duty he has always regretted deeply that this discussion was not opened before the death of general lee if the charges so vehemently urged had been preferred or even suggested in lees lifetime longstreet does not believe they would have needed any reply from him general lee would have answered them himself and set history right but after all longstreet does not fear the verdict of history on gettysburg he holds that time sets all things right error lives but a daytruth is eternal it seems advisable here to introduce general longstreets personal version of the animus of the afterthewar criticism of his operations on the field of gettysburg taken from his war history from manassas to appomattox as the whole animus of the latterday adverse criticisms upon and uncritical assertions in regard to the commander of the first corps of the army of northern virginia had its origin in this matter of politics a brief review of the circumstances is in order as will be readily recalled by my older readers while for the younger it is a matter of history president johnson after the war adopted a reconstruction policy of his own and some of the states were reorganized under it with democratic governors and legislatures and all would have followed but congress being largely republican was not satisfied and enacted that the states could not be accepted unless they provided in their new constitutions for negro suffrage in case they would not the state governments should be removed and the states placed in the hands of general officers of the army as military governors who should see that the states were reorganized and restored to the union under the laws under the severe ordeal one of the city papers of new orleans called upon the generals of confederate service to advise the people of the course that they should pursuenaming the officers i thought it better policy to hold the states as they were organized under the presidents policy shape their constitutions as directed by congress and have the states not yet reorganized follow the same course my letter upon the subject was as follows i might have added that not less forceful than the grounds i gave were the obligations under which we were placed by the terms of our parolesto respect the laws of congressbut the letter was enough the afternoon of the day upon which my letter was published the paper that had called for advice published a column of editorial calling me traitor deserter of my friends and accusing me of joining the enemy but did not publish a line of the letter upon which it based the charges other papers of the democracy took up the garbled representation of this journal and spread it broadcast not even giving the letter upon which they based their evil attacks upon me up to that time the first corps in all of its parts in all of its history was above reproach i was in successful business in new orleans as cotton factor with a salary from an insurance company of five thousand dollars per year the day after the announcement old comrades passed me on the streets without speaking business began to grow dull general hood the only one of my old comrades who occasionally visited me thought that he could save the insurance business and in a few weeks i found myself at leisure two years after that period on march 4 1869 general grant was inaugurated president of the united states and in the bigness of his generous heart called me to washington before i found opportunity to see him he sent my name to the senate for confirmation as surveyor of customs at new orleans i was duly confirmed and held the office until 1873 when i resigned since that time i have lived in new orleans louisiana and in gainesville georgia surrounded by a few of my old friends and in occasional appreciative touch with others south and north the personal letters and official reports of robert e lee reproduced in this work clearly established that from gettysburg to appomattox longstreet continued to be lees most trusted lieutenant their mutual affection and admiration had no diminution the official reports of lee and pendleton herein given make it clear as noonday that longstreet disobeyed no orders of his chief at gettysburg and was at no time slow or obstructive on that great field the man who under the weight of official evidence massed in this little story can still raise his voice to assert that longstreet was slow and balky at gettysburg takes direct issue with the official reports of robert e lee and the rev mr pendleton and his becomes a quarrel with the war records 1 when the war was over he placed himself on the high plane of american citizenship where all patriots now stand he accepted office at the hands of a republican president pardonable offence in this good day these were crimes which the temper of the south could not condone some forty years ago 2 he had protested against wrecking the confederate cause on the rocks of cemetery hill in sheer selfdefence he was compelled to recapitulate in plainest terms general lees tactical mistakes and their fatal consequences to many that was a crime never to be forgiven yet at the time and on the spot general lee was morally brave enough to place the blame where it belongedon his own shoulders lee never sought a scapegoat for the mistakes of gettysburg this is the story short enough for the busy clear and straight enough for the young it is the story of sentiment as well as reverence and admiration growing up from childhood of him who led the forlorn hope at gettysburg but behind the sentiment is the unassailable truth it is undeniably the story of the records of the events exactly as they occurred it is fully corroborated by all the probabilities in no part disputed by one it is the story told by general longstreet himself and nobody familiar with his open character and candid manner of discussing its various phases can doubt for one instant that he tells the details of gettysburg exactly as they occurred in so far as his personal part was concerned of him i would say as his sun slants towards the west and the evening hours draw near that his unmatched courage to meet the enemies of the peace time outshines the valor of the fields whereon his blood was shed so copiously in the cause of his country i would tell him that his detractors are not the south they are not the democratic party they represent nobody and nothing but the blindness of passion that desires not light i would tell him that the great loyal south loves him today as in the old days when he sacrificed on her altars a career in the army of the nation when the thunder of his guns was heard around the world and the earth shook beneath the tread of his soldiers and as he journeys down to the valley of silence the true sentiment of the generous south that he loves so well is voiced by hon john temple graves in the atlanta georgia news the original plan of this little work was to publish only the short story of gettysburg which was written while general longstreet lived my friends have insisted that the generous public although it has received the prospectus of the work with such warm appreciation will be disappointed if i discuss only the one event of his most eventful life and so have been added the paper on the mexican war and chapters on his famous campaigns of the civil war they have insisted further that i must speak of longstreet the man i have replied that i could not my heart is sore i cannot forget that he poured out his heroic blood in defence of the southern people and when there was not a flag left for him to fight for many of them turned against him and persecuted him with a bitterness that saddened his last years they undertook to rob him of the glories of his many peerless campaigns to convict him of treason to his cause on the field of battle and when he lay dead forty years after his worldfamous victories perhaps from an opening of the old wound received at the wilderness a chapter of the daughters of the confederacy of the state beneath whose sod rests his valiant dust refused to send flowers to his grave because they said he disobeyed orders at gettysburg and a southern camp of the sons of confederate veterans refused for the same alleged reason to send a message of sympathy to his family if i should now undertake to write about him i might speak of such things as these with bitterness and i must not so speak because i am a southern woman and the southern peoplemy peoplemust forever be to me as they were to him dear as the ruddy drops about his heart i must not write about him until i can write bravely sweetly cheerfully and in this hour it is perhaps more than my human nature can do and i cannot take the public into my confidence about the man i loved the subject is too sacred but my friends demand at least one page on the man as i knew him that the south at lastthe dear south that i love with all my heartmay know him and love him as i did and so i undertake to string together disjointedly a few incidents of a life that was lived upon high levels brave and blameless and that the days give back to me a glorified memory coupled with a great thankfulness that i had a small part in it from my childhood he had been the fine embodiment of my ideals of chivalry and courage the sorrows of his later years aroused all the tender pity of my heart his wounds and sufferings enveloped him with poetic interest he was fighting the battles of my country before i was born the blood of my ancestors had dyed the brilliant fields whereon he led he was ever the hero of my young dreams and throughout a long and checkered career always to me a figure of matchless splendor and gallantry his life was set to serious work his father died before he was old enough to understand the meaning of a fathers care he had but little schooling before he went to west point as cadet of the military academy from west point he went into service in the mexican war and was in every battle save one of the war that gave to us an empire in wealth and territory winning promotions for gallantry on the field after the mexican war he saw long service on the western frontier he entered the civil war of 186165 and the greatest confederate victories of that greatest war of civilized times are inscribed upon his battleflags the glories of manassas williamsburg fredericksburg chickamauga the east tennessee campaigns the wilderness the campaigns about richmond and the last desperate struggles on the way to appomattox gather about his name after the civil war came the most trying period of his lifethe dark days of reconstruction the fierce dissensions between the sections and between those holding different views in the same section the hot feeling and prejudices of the time the struggle to repair the ruined fortunes of war when he was finally gathered to his fathers at the ripe old age of eightythree he was still in harness holding the position under the government of united states commissioner of railroads this busy exciting and strenuous life was calculated to develop in him the qualities of the soldier the man of affairs the blood and iron of nature rather than her gentler qualities nevertheless his heart was as tender as a womans the sentiment and romance of his being never ceased to be exerted and he exhibited to the last a tenderness of feeling and thoughtfulness regarding others which were in singular and beautiful contrast to the main currents of his life this i think will appear without any special effort to show it as this sketch goes on general longstreet was born in edgefield district south carolina january 8 1821 his early years were spent in the country his father was a planter natural to him was all the vigor and fire of that heroic section and still there was in him a coolness conservatism and iron will tempered by justice and fair judgment embracing the best of his dutch ancestry his ancestors on this side of the water were chiefly the dents marshalls and randolphs of virginia on the maternal side his grandfather marshall dent traced his line back to the conqueror his mother was mary ann dent of the family that furnished the lady who became famous as the wife of the soldierpresident grant his father was james longstreet his grandfather on his fathers side was william longstreet it is interesting here to note that this william longstreet was the inventor of the steamboat he discovered the principle in a series of experiments about the kitchen and the mills and after much care and trouble he was able to apply the principle he made a rather pudgy steamboat rigged it up with all necessary equipment and successfully ran it for some miles up and down the savannah river he did not have the means to develop it to such extent as to demonstrate to the world its possibilities fully appreciating the importance of the invention he appealed to governor telfair the then governor of georgia for aid very naturally the aid was refused him for that was a day of scepticism regarding newfangled things he was made sport of by the people around and called billy boy the dreamer and made the subject of doggerel poetry as an authentic part of the story i give here the letter which he wrote to governor telfair which is still preserved in the state archives of georgia his father having died when he was but twelve years old general longstreets mother moved shortly afterwards to augusta georgia where she resided a few years after which she moved to alabama the education of young longstreet was then intrusted to his uncle judge a b longstreet for many years president of emory college at oxford georgia and one of the most illustrious presidents of that famous old college judge longstreet was noted as lawyer judge educator and writer he is a very poorly read georgian a rather poorly read southerner who has not enjoyed and talked to his friends about that book of wonderful naturalness humor and human philosophy georgia scenes the author of this book was judge a b longstreet in later years its authorship has been often erroneously credited to general longstreet entirely immersed in his college duties judge longstreet had but little time to give to his youthful nephew of those early days it is only known that the boy was not much of a student that the massive old oaks of oxford appealed to him more than the schoolroom that fishing in the streams around and chasing rabbits over the fields formed his dearest enjoyment in his habits and feeling he was then and always near to nature the flash of the lightning in midheaven interested him more than the voltaic sparks of the lectureroom he was mischievous full of fun and frolic but beneath all that he was almost from babyhood planning for a larger career in the outside world and longing to be a soldier and fight his countrys battles the books that he loved most told of alexander and csar of napoleon and his marshals of george washington and the revolution he wanted to do things not to study about them he received his west point appointment through a relative in alabama who was a member of congress the appointment came naturally from alabama because his mother was living there he went to west point at the age of sixteen this was one of the proudest days of his life it was the beginning of the fulfilment of his dreams he had not an idea that any human agency could turn him from the soldier course in which he was directed or could delay him for an instant and yet while he was in new york city arranging for the change from the cars to the hudson river boat he was approached by two little boys of guileless appearance who told him that their father had recently died away down in south carolina that they had no money that their mother had no money that they just must get to their dead father and wouldnt he help them out with a tenderness of heart characteristic of him then and always he was about to open to them his purse and take the chances of never reaching west point when a policeman who had observed the performance approached and prevented the innocent embryo soldier from being fleeced by the youthful bunco steerers of the city arriving at west point he proudly went to the hotel to register and take a room and was much chagrined upon being told by the proprietor that they didnt take in kids he was directed to the cadets quarters and his first humiliation there was the further discovery that instead of being waited on as a dignified soldier should be by half a dozen servants he had to keep his own room make his own bed black his own boots his thoughts of war had been associated with fierce fighting the killing of many enemies the capturing of many prisoners his preconceived idea of a prisoner was gained while a small boy in alabama he had heard that a prisoner was down at the station and ran there full of expectancy to see what a prisoner was like he discovered a big buck negro black as midnight large as two ordinary men with countenance ferocious his first west point assignment which gave promise of the heroic was to guard a prisoner he was given a gun for the purpose the figure of the alabama darky came to his mind and he wondered if the gun were big enough to kill him in case that should be necessary examining it he discovered alas that it was not even loaded sent to guard a terrible prisoner with an unloaded gun when he got to the place of service he was relieved surprised and equally disgusted by the discovery that the prisoner was a fellowstudent who had broken the rulesa poor little weakly cadaverous fellow whom he could pick up and throw into the hudson without half trying as a west point cadet so far as the drilling the field practice the athletics all the outdoor work was concerned he sustained himself well he was very large very strong well proportioned he had darkbrown hair blue eyes features that might have served for a grecian model he was six feet two inches tall of soldierly bearing and was voted the handsomest cadet at west point as a student of books however he was not a success they seemed to contain so much that did not properly belong to the life of a soldier that he could not become interested enough in them to learn them in his third year he failed in mechanics and did not rise until given a second trial in scholarship he always ranked much closer to the foot than to the head of his class he was just a little better student than his friend u s grant which was poor praise indeed but their after careers told a different story i may be pardoned for digressing here to speak of the strong schoolboy friendship which began at west point between grant and longstreet and lasted throughout their lives grant was of the class after longstreet but somehow their silent serious natures were in spontaneous accord and they became fast friends from their first meeting that one was from the west and one from the south made no difference just as later it made no difference in their feeling of personal affection that one led the army of the union and the other the army of the confederacy after their graduation at west point they were both stationed at jefferson barracks near st louis the dent family lived near by longstreet was a cousin and he was particularly fond of his cousin julia dent he took his friend grant out to see her and the result of the introduction was their marriage five years later there was such a contrast between her tall cousin james and her short admirer ulysses that her friends often joked her about the little lieutenant with the big epaulettes grant and longstreet went through the mexican war together and their boyhood friendship was indissolubly cemented by the associations of camp life on the mexican border longstreet went in as a lieutenant and came out as a major general worth apologized giving longstreets youth as an excuse for not recommending him for higher promotion promotions in the army in those days were not so rapid as at the present time the first meeting of grant and longstreet during the civil war was not a personal meeting it was when they were leading opposing forces at the battle of the wilderness it is known to all students of our civil war history that the confederate forces led by longstreet were getting all the better of it at the wilderness and that the union forces under grant were being driven back when longstreet was shot down and carried from the field he was leading his men after his customhe never followed never told them to go but always bade them come he was at this crucial point at the battle of the wilderness far in advance of his menso far in advance that they mistook him for the enemy and fired upon him shot through the shoulder and the throat wounded nigh unto death he was taken from the field with this calamity discovered the confederates held up in their swift advance the impression rapidly spread that longstreet was killed the surgeons and attendants who were bearing him to the rear called out to the soldiers and asked that the cry be sent down the lines longstreet is not killed he is only wounded the men who had seen him fall cried out they are fooling us he is dead general longstreet has said that he heard both cries he knew he was not dead but did not know how soon he might be he had just strength enough left to lift his hat for this purpose he exerted that strength and waved his hat to his men that they might see that he still lived but the genius of the battle of the wilderness borne to the rear even the ever dauntless confederates could not follow up the advantage they had won the next meeting of these two personal friends and opposing generals was at appomattox in the beginning of that momentous conference general lee called general longstreet to him and asked him in case honorable terms of surrender should not be offered and in the ensuing developments it should be necessary for the confederates to fight their way out if he would stand by him longstreet replied that he would fight and die fighting general longstreet often spoke of the details of the capitulation at appomattox he said that when he went into the conferenceroom in the mclean residence as one of the confederate commissioners he was compelled to pass through the room occupied by general grant as his headquarters he felt curious to know how general grant would receive him he had loved grant as one of his closest boyhood friends but times were much changed grant was victor he was vanquished he was therefore prepared to observe the rigid demeanor of those between whom ceremony only forces recognition but immediately he entered the room grant rose approached him with a greater show of demonstration than ever in the olden days and slapped him on the shoulder exclaiming well old pete cant we get back to the good old days by playing a game of brag at west point the nickname among the boys for general longstreet was old pete no one ever knew why any more than they know why this or that college president is designated peleg or squeers it has often been related by general longstreet and by others that general lee went into the appomattox conference dressed in full uniform and making withal the best appearance that this most noble soldier in his dire defeat could make general grant on the contrary had not dressed up for the occasion he wore his old fighting uniform mud bespattered evidencing no acquaintance even with a dustingbrush the important part of that meeting the splendid bearing of the conquered confederates the modest demeanor of the union victors and above all the noble generosity of grant in refusing to accept the sword of lee and in giving the fairest terms possible under the existing conditionsthese are known to all who have read united states history when general lee rode back to his headquarters from this fateful conference his halfstarved ragged wornout worshipful followers saluted him from both sides of the road overcome with emotion he dared not look directly into their faces he held his hat in his hand and fixed his eyes straight between his horses ears the parting at appomattox between lee and his officers was most kindly affectionate and touching in every instance but when general longstreet approached general lee threw his arms about him and locked in each others embrace the two wept with a bitterness of regret that ordinary mortals can never understand soon after the war general longstreet visited washington and was invited to be the guest of a union officer he protested against accepting the invitation saying that it was too soon after the fighting but the insistence was so cordial as to leave no excuse for refusal once under an officers roof it became his pleasant duty to pay his respects to the commanding general who was of course general grant grant received him with all his oldtime cordiality and invited him to take supper at his house that evening saying quickly as enforcement of the invitation that his wife would be anxious to see him the evening was pleasantly spent and upon taking his leave general grant walked to the gate with general longstreet where he said now that it is all over would you not like to have pardon general longstreet replied with a touch of southern fire that he was unaware of having done anything in need of pardon general grant replied that he had perhaps used the wrong word as he was more of a soldier than a linguist that he meant to ask if general longstreet would like to have amnesty general longstreet answered that he was back in the union meant to live in the union was ready at that moment to fight for the union and would be happy if his old friend could place him in the way of restored citizenship general grant requested him to come again to his office the following morning and said that in the mean time he would see the president and secretary of war in general longstreets behalf in the morning he gave general longstreet a letter to president johnson full of warm interest and broadmindedness characteristic of grant which is here reproduced armed with this letter general longstreet sought president johnson in the interview that followed the presentation of the letter the president was nervous ill at ease and somewhat resentful he would not decide to grant the request and he would not positively refuse finally he asked general longstreet to call again the following morning at this next meeting he was still noncommittal and at length closed the interview by saying there are three men this union will never forgive they have given it too much trouble they are jefferson davis robert e lee and james longstreet general longstreet said those who are forgiven much love much mr president johnson answered you have high authority for that statement general but you cannot have amnesty it was shortly afterwards granted by act of congress general longstreets name being added to a list of prominent confederate officers by the especial request of grant these incidents in the associations of grant and longstreet come in naturally in a paper of this kind i always think of them togetheras chums at west point as comrades in the west and on the fields of mexico as opposing forces in the mightiest war the world has witnessed and after that war was ended as good friends again in the stronger nation president johnson who had started out with the plan of being generous to the south and for some unknown reason departed from that policy conceived the idea of having arrested and thrown into prison and tried for treason a number of the high officers of the confederacy he called for a cabinet meeting to get an endorsement of this plan and sent for general grant to attend the meeting he forcibly presented his reasons for the procedure and asked for the opinions of those present after much discussion there was general acquiescence by the cabinet the silent man of destiny was the last member of the conference to open his lips he said i will resign my commission in the army before i will as commanding general sign a warrant for the arrest of any of these confederate officers as long as they observe the honorable terms of surrender made to me it would be easy to write a book about a statement like that but the book when written would not be as good as the unadorned statement the illustrious union generals noble generosity to the conquered south is an old tale but it is so beautiful that it bears repetition and i love to repeat it i have digressed from the main line of this paper to pay to general longstreets boyhood friend the modest tribute of my admiration from early childhood i reverenced grant i always regarded him as the greatest man the greatest general the greatest hero on the union side i have now a lifesize steelengraving of him that i secured when a girl this was long before i knew much of that side of his life which has since most appealed to me my admiration of him has been in every way strengthened by the stories general longstreet told me of him particularly the stories showing his generosity to his foes and his many private and official kindnesses to the widows and orphans of confederate officers and privates of these stories i give one typical of many when grant was president a widow of a confederate officer applied for a postoffice in a small southern town hearing nothing of her application she came to washington to press it she was unable to move the authorities at the postoffice department and was about to go home in despair when a friend suggested that it might be worth while for her to see the president with much effort she summoned courage and appeared at the white house the president received her in a most friendly manner and after hearing her story took her application and wrote a brief but strong endorsement on the back of it she hurried in triumph to the postoffice department the official to whom she presented the application frowned and pondered over it for some time and then wrote under the presidents endorsement this being a fourthclass office the president does not have the appointing power the application was handed back to her and she went away in deep distress and was again preparing to return home when another friend told her by all means to take the paper back to the president so that he might see how his endorsement had been received she did so the president wrote under the last endorsement while the president does not have the appointing power in this office he has the appointment of the postmastergeneral and summoning his secretary directed him to accompany the lady to the department and in person deliver her application to the postmastergeneral it is needless to add that she received the commission before leaving the office while on a tour through the west in 1899 general longstreet was entertained in san diego california at a dinner at the home of u s grant jr after dinner he requested the company to stand while he proposed a toast we expected perhaps some pleasantry or gallant compliment to the hostess he said thirtyodd years ago i first met general grant in the civil war at the wilderness and there received the wound that paralyzed my right arm during the fiercest warfare this nation has seen general grant was the strongest obstacle that stood between me and my people and the consummation of the dearest hopes that they then cherished now in this day of peace and union with not a cloud upon the sky of a reunited country in the presence of general grants descendants under the roof of his namesake son i want to drink this toast to the memory of grant revered alike by the brave men who fought with him and the equally brave men who fought him fifty years before the pleasant day in san diego fresh from the fields of his honors and victories in mexico young major longstreet had come home to wed the daughter of his old brigade commander colonel john garland she was marie louise garland a very charming woman and so small of figure as to be in striking contrast to her husband of six feet two they were engaged for some time before the breaking out of the mexican war with a lofty deference which he bravely overcame in later life he had never kissed his fiance in setting out for the mexican war he said that he thought inasmuch as he might get killed and never see her again it might not be improper under all the sad circumstances to kiss her they had ten children five of whom died in infancy a word as to the living five a son born in virginia during the war was named robert lee after the southern commander this son served in the recent spanishamerican war and was by happy fortune a member of the staff of general fitzhugh lee he is now in the government service at washington city another son named james after his father was born in virginia not long after the surrender at the time general longstreet wrote to an absent relative this is my union son but he has a yell like the rebel yell when trying to reach the breastworks i have named him james after myself and i know he will always be as good a union man as i am going to be hereafter this son likewise saw volunteer service in the spanishamerican war he afterwards received a commission in the regular army and is now serving in the philippines in the thirteenth cavalry this union officer son is a strong democrat his brother in washington is an equally strong republican the general always taught that political alignment should be based upon conviction alone his oldest son john an architect lives in atlanta the youngest son randolph a farmer lives on the home place at gainesville the only daughter is mrs whelchel of gainesville georgia there are five grandchildren general longstreet said that he started out in his married life with the purpose of preserving military discipline in the familymanaging the family as he would manage soldiers on the field he soon found that this would not work and turned over the chief control of his home to his wife general longstreet was a great admirer of ladies and has often said that he never saw enough of them never knew as many as he wanted to know into his soldier life few ladies had come when he got into civil life he wondered where all the ladies came from after the civil war he was much petted and kissed by the ladies of the south as was the custom with the old heroes of the war he submitted to it with something more than willingness particularly from the younger and prettier girls he always had for woman in the abstract the tenderest love and reverence he considered her the human temple of all loveliness he preserved to the end of his long life the romance and sentiment which having but half a chance to develop in his youth had continued to develop in his later years the home was ever to him the holy of holies last summer at chicago he met the daughter of his first sweetheart and told her with beautiful navet that her mother had been his sweetheart before going to west point that he had meant to marry her when he got back though he had not told her so and on returning to his disgust he found her married to another fellow after the mexican war general longstreet served extensively in the indian campaigns out west he considered it his duty and made it his delight as do all good soldiers to go willingly where he was sent when choice was allowed him he went where the service was hardest he did not ask to dine nicely nor to sleep warm a storm cloud was not too rough a covering for him he did not seek olympian sunshine he could gladly make the rocky mountains his bed and the warwhoop of the indian seeking to disturb the peace of his country was music to his ears the highest word that he knew was duty his country he loved above all things else he served in the united states army for almost a quarter of a century nearly always west of the mississippi when the civil war broke out he was paymaster at albuquerque new mexico with the rank of major the country had for years been in comparative peace and he had given up the cherished idea of military glory and high promotion where did his duty lie in this hour he had loyally served in the union army for nearly twentyfive years and through the war that gave to the nation a rich empire his state and his people were now going to fight the union the union officers with whom he was serving and the union soldiers whom he had commanded pleaded with him to stay with the union their wives and daughters entreated him and wept over him the power of vast association appealed wonderfully to him but he thought that duty called him to the service of the south and no earthly power could keep him from that service he sent in his resignation and set out at once for richmond his relatives and friends along the way only taking time to speak to him as he passed hastened him on to richmond it was a gala journey that he made through the southern country the music of southern songs was borne upon every breeze the wildest enthusiasm electrified town and hamlet from the open doors of every farmhouse came salutations cheering the passengers on to richmond he was not allowed to pay for entertainment at any southern hotel everything was free for those who were going to join jeff davis for dixie and for southern rights longstreet entered the confederate service as brigadiergeneral and reported for duty to general beauregard at the first manassas after the baptism of fire at antietam in 1862 longstreet was made lieutenantgeneral next in rank to lee this rank he retained to the end of the war ranking even stonewall jackson this fact is especially mentioned because the last generation of the south have often confused the rank secured by their fathers in the war with the paper ranks given by the confederacy when the war was over and that government heroic in its ruins had nothing else to give i have heard it said by many union officers that longstreets corps the first corps was the terror of the union army i have heard it said that longstreet was the only officer in the confederate army whom grant and lincoln wholesomely feared he was lees right arm in very truth the morning of the battle of the wilderness while president lincoln was at the war department some one asked him what is the best thing that can happen to the union today he answered to kill longstreet it nearly happened but by the bullets of longstreets own men because in so gallantly leading them he went too far in front after the fall of the curtain at appomattox general longstreet went to new orleans and engaged in the cotton and insurance business he developed in business the splendid ability that marked him as a soldier he was making ten thousand dollars a year at the time the celebrated difference of opinion came up as to the course the south should pursue in the rehabilitation of the warwasted land it was then that he wrote the famous political letter of 1867 that turned the south against him and made it practically impossible for him to do business in that section of the country the idea that this letter was written to secure political preferment from the powers in authority is perfectly absurd he was making more in business and would have made still more and more as the years went on than he could make then or ever afterwards in politics besides to me and to any one who ever knew the real man the idea of his changing his convictions a hairs breadth for any sort of gain is too farfetched for serious discussion the very head and front of his offending consisted in his belief that it was better for the south to accept the situation then presented better for the highclass men of the south to hold the offices than to have the negroes and scallawags hold them better for the south to keep faith with its appomattox parole which promised obedience to constituted authority it was a few years after this letter that president grant appointed him surveyor of the port at new orleans he never asked for this appointment and was not consulted about it president grant in the generosity of his heart voluntarily sent his name to the senate and the first news general longstreet had of it came through the press general longstreet never affiliated with the controlling element of the republican party in the south he believed in a white mans republican party in the south and therefore was never in favor with the dominant republican party in that section that believed differently the political appointments that came to him came because of his high character and his record of substantial achievement and in spite of the opposition of miscellaneous competitive placeseekers he led a political movement that has had no following in the southern section it would seemingly have been easy for him to have acquiesced in the methods of the republican machinery in the southern states which would naturally have made him the head and front of the southern republican party it would have seemed easier in an earlier day for him to have gone with the democracy which would have made him the political idol of the south as he had been its military idol is is so much easier to be a demagogue than it is to be a man it requires no unusual moral caliber to take a seat on the bandwagon and go with the crowd conscience compelled james longstreet to oppose politically for their own good as he saw it his southern fellowcountrymen he announced his convictions and stood by them he never profited as we measure material benefits he lost the qualities he exhibited in these crucial periods of his life differentiated the man from the timeserver and placeseeker one who loved him and was close to him in life said regretfully not long ago in speaking of him that he never did anything after appomattox that turned out for his own good i felt a sudden tightening about my heart at this criticism perhaps as we view worldly honors and earthly goods the things he did after appomattox did not turn out for his own good but to me he has always been a figure of more sublime courage in the gathering storms of 67 and the years that followed than on any of the brilliant fields of the civil war and i love best to think of him not as the warrior leading his legions to victory but as the grand citizen after the war was ended nobly dedicating himself to the rehabilitation of his broken people offering a brave mans homage to the flag of the established government and standing steadfast in all the passions prejudices and persecutions of that unhappy period it was the love and honor and soul of the man crystallized into a being of wonderful majesty immovable as gibraltar there be things o sons of what has deserved birthright in the land of freedom the good of which and the use of which are beyond all calculation of earthly goods and worldly usesthings that cannot be bought with a price and do not die with death these gathering strength and beauty in james longstreets character through the four terrible years of warfare assumed colossal proportions in the dark reconstruction era and when the story of his life has finally been told in all its grandeur the finer fame will settle not about the valorous soldier but about longstreet the patriotcitizen when general longstreet quit fighting he quit fighting for good he considered that the south was back in the union to stay there is no doubt in the minds of many with whom i have talked that general longstreets conciliatory course because of its effect in holding thousands obedient to the laws of the government prevented the confiscation of much property in the south immediately after the war and greatly alleviated the trials of that distressing period the local ostracism of that day and subsequently cut general longstreet deeply he loved the south with all the tenderness of one who was willing to die for it in all the quiet hours that he discussed the misrepresentations of the southern people the resentment they bore him the criticisms and slanders that had been hurled at him i never heard him utter a word against them or give expression to a note of bitterness but i think towards the last exhausted by much suffering he had a pitiful yearning for complete reconciliation with all his people not many months before he died an officer of the northern armies was calling on him at his hotel in washington and in discussing the civil war and subsequent events and general longstreets part therein said the southern people have not appreciated you since the war general but when you are dead they will build monuments to you general longstreet said nothing but his eyes slowly filled while he bore unjust criticism in silence he was visibly moved by any evidence of affection from the southern people i recall two very beautiful press tributes that appeared last summer while he was lying desperately ill at his home in gainesville georgia one was from the pen of hon john temple graves in the atlanta georgia news the other by mrs w h felton an oldtime friend in the atlanta journal mr graves a representative of the splendid new south spoke of the new generations as worthy descendants of the heroic days and the place general longstreet would always hold in their hearts and mrs felton one of the important figures of the old south told of the undying love for him of the soldiers of the confederacy and of the place he had worthily won in the affections of all the people she wanted to speak these words to him for the comfort they would give him and because he had nobly earned the right to hear them and ten thousand times more from the people whose battles he had fought when he seemed out of immediate danger and strong enough to understand i read these tributes to him and he wept like a child the forbearance of the man and his generous feeling towards those who used him harshly finally became a wonder and is today a joy for me to remember i will here give an instance or two touchingly illustrative of this side of his character general wade hampton as stoical as ever a roman was felt very bitterly against general longstreet because of his republican politics he expressed his feelings freely both in public and private and was embittered to the extent that he refused to speak to general longstreet when general longstreet succeeded him as united states commissioner of railroads he would not come to the office to turn it over to his successor general longstreet went to the office took the oath alone and endeavored as best he could to make himself acquainted with the duties of the position when he came home that evening and told me with evident surprise that general hampton was still bitter against him i asked rather in the hope of getting a reply in criticism of general hampton what sort of a soldier was general hampton since he seems so intractable in civil life general longstreet replied without a moments hesitation there was not a finer braver more gallant officer in the confederate service than wade hampton and when general hampton died i think the most splendid tribute paid him came from the pen of general longstreet years ago there were political differences between general longstreet and judge emory speer now of the federal bench of georgia then a member of congress from the old eighth district of georgia general longstreet felt that he had been wronged the summer before his death we were at mt airy georgia for a short time one day i saw judge speer in the hotel where we were stopping and asked general longstreet how he was going to receive him if judge speer should come to speak to him in view of their past differences the general replied as i would receive any other distinguished american and as for our past differences that has been a long time ago and i have forgotten what it was all about general john b gordon during recent years did general longstreet injustice i know he caused him much pain at a time when general longstreet was suffering horriblyone eye had already been destroyed by the dreadful disease he had long been deaf and paralyzed from war service the wound in his throat was giving him severest painat this sad time general gordon revived the old threadbare story that he had disobeyed orders at gettysburg but when a reporter from one of the new york dailies called to interview him about general gordon and his charges he refused to say one word it was then that i said if you will not reply to general gordon i will and in the future so long as i shall live whenever your war record is attacked i will make answer and so it happened that the little story of gettysburg was written while general longstreet was nearing the grave during these last sorrowful days he had heard that general gordon was not in good health and he asked me with touching concern about his condition i expected to tell general gordon of these occurrences but i never saw him again the reaper gathered him in ten days after general longstreet answered the call general longstreet was a most devout churchman in early life he was an episcopalian and he regularly attended that church in new orleans until the political differences developed between himself and his friends after that he noticed that even his church associates avoided him they would not sit in the same pew with him cut to the quick by such treatment he began to wonder if there was any church broad enough to withstand differences caused by political and sectional feeling he discovered that the roman catholic priests extended him the treatment he longed for he began to attend that church and has said that its atmosphere from the first appealed to him as the church of the sorrowladen of earth he was converted under the ministration of father ryan after accepting the faith of the catholic church he followed it with beautiful devotion he regarded it as the compensation sent him by the almighty for doing his duty as he saw it he clung to it as the best consolation there was in life he went to his duties as devoutly as any priest of the church and was on his knees night and morning with the simple loving faith of a little child the political estrangements between general longstreet and many of the leaders of the south never extended to the soldiers who did any large amount of fighting for the south there was a confederate reunion in atlanta in 1898 a camp of confederate veterans of augusta georgia made up of his old command sent general longstreet a special request to come down from his home in gainesville and to wear his old uniform he replied that his uniform had been destroyed years ago in the fire which burned his home and practically everything else he had but that he would gladly go down with what was left of himselfthat his old trunk of a body was the only relic of the confederacy remaining to him they then secured his measure and had a new confederate uniform made for him to represent the old as nearly as possible during all his stay at that reunion the old soldiers flocked about him with a devotion that napoleon would have envied they went wild over him when he went to the diningroom at the hotel the doors had to be closed so that he could take his meals without interruption one evening in the kimball his old boys surged about him by the thousands for hours eager to touch his hand to touch his garments to look into his face and the tears streamed down his cheeks just before that one day outraged at some unkindness that had come from the south i had said to general longstreet the southern people are no longer my people i have no home and no country in the midst of the splendid demonstration at the reunion of 1898 when the thousands who had followed his colors stood with uncovered heads in his honored presence i said to him this is the south that i love because it loves you it is the magnificent generous loyal south that i love with every impulse of my heart these are my people i think he never forgot the confederate reunion in atlanta in 1898 his old soldiers came to his room in a continuous stream one afternoon when he was asleep utterly worn out a onelegged onearmed veteran poorly clad looking poorly fed came to his room i told him of the generals exhausted conditionthat he needed the rest and i was really afraid to disturb him then he said wont you let me go in and look at my old commander asleep i havent seen him since appomattox i came all the way from texas to see him and i may never see him again without a word i opened the door and as the worn veteran looked upon his old chieftain we both cried in the midst of it general longstreet wakened and called the veteran to him they embraced like brothers and wept together on the eve of the spanishamerican war general longstreet received hundreds of letters from his old soldiers in every part of the country asking for the privilege of seeing service with him under the flag of the union one of them wrote if this country is going to have another war i want to be in it and i want to follow my old commander general longstreet answered that he was seventyeight deaf and paralyzed that he had two sons he would send to fight for him but that if his country needed his services his sword was at its command as commissioner of railroads general longstreet made a tour of the west in 1899 he was received with beautiful consideration everywhere but the welcome which touched him most was that of his old soldiers who greeted him in every state it was marvellous to see how the veterans of a war that was over forty years ago had scattered through the west and it certainly seemed that every one there had heard that general longstreet was coming and came to the nearest station to see him with them were many union veterans who gave him an equally cordial greeting i will digress here to say that general longstreet could never stand on a foot of northern soil where he was not received with every manifestation of earthly honor and esteem by the union veterans and their descendants and this touched him as nothing else in the world could have done i wish to offer the humble tribute of my love to the chivalrous section that is today so close to my heart the honors they paid general longstreet their tributes to him did not end with the grave two weeks after the prospectus of this little volume had been sent out the first edition had been bought long before it was ready for delivery by the grand army of the republic and the orders were accompanied by testimonials to general longstreet as soldier and patriot that would make a memorial volume of rich value and a brief selection at least i hope to give in future editions at one place on his western tour in 1899 it became necessary for him to telegraph to an official of the rock island road to ask if he would pass his car it happened that this official had been a union officer who had received hard blows from longstreet on many bloody fields he replied that in the old days that tried the courage of men he was much more anxious to pass longstreet than to meet him that now he was going to insist on meeting him first and afterwards he would pass anything the general wanted him to pass next to the pleasure of meeting his old friends on this western tour general longstreet most enjoyed the wonderful development of the country that had taken place since he was chasing wild indians across its wide plains the smiling farms that greeted him the magnificent cities the marvellously fertile irrigated sections that he had last beheld as deserts the network of competing railroads which had taken the place of the trail and the halfworked wagonroads the evidences everywhere of a magnificent country built up by progressive peopleall these with all the suggestiveness attaching to them appealed with mighty force to his heart and to his mental appreciation the picture of industrial growth is a beautiful and impressive one it is a story in itself that needs only a suggestion to make it as large a part of this as it should make genuine americanism a love of his country in every sentiment that concerns it and every line of development affecting it formed a very large and attractive phase of general longstreets character and so from every standpoint he enjoyed this western trip to the full next to the smoke of battle in the cause of his country he loved nature in her gentlest and most quiet moods he was fond of the forest and farm he owned a small farm near gainesville georgia which was one of the delights of his life here he set out an orchard and a vineyard on a scale somewhat extensive in which he found much pleasure it is a hilly uneven country this rugged piedmont section of north georgia noted for its red clay its rocks its mighty trees the wild honeysuckles that carpet its woods and the purity of the air that sweeps over it and the water that gushes in abundance from its depths general longstreet made his little farm in this picturesque section as productive and attractive as he could it was mostly hills and had to be terraced extensively to keep it from washing away he had it terraced with much care and laid off something after the manner of a battlefield thereupon the people around jokingly called it gettysburg here he had built and lived in a splendid home of the old colonial style of architecture such as has long been popular in the south the house was richly furnished he had one of the finest libraries in the south and had collected interesting and valuable souvenirs and furnishings from all over the world his residence was situated on a lordly eminence beyond the everlasting mountains stretched in unbroken length in the valley between the placid waters of the mountain streams wound lazily to the sea the location was most beautiful and has often been called inspiration point amid these romantic surroundings general longstreet dispensed a hospitality characteristic of the most splendid days of the old south he often laughingly said that his house became a rendezvous for old confederates who were hastily going west and needed a little aid they never knocked in vain at his door he has said that a favorite tale of theirs was that they had just killed a yankee and had to go west hurriedly thinking of course that this plea would strike a sympathetic chord some twenty years ago general longstreets home and everything it contained save the people vanished in flames after that he lived in one of the outhouses a small frame cottage such as any carpenter might build and any countryman might own some years ago hamlin garland visited gainesville for the purpose of calling on general longstreet after talking with him mr garland wrote a very interesting article about him he especially marvelled that he should find so great a man so colossal a character living in such modest fashion seemingly almost forgotten by all sections of the country in whose destiny he had played so important a part he said he found a worldfamous general pruning grapevines on a red hillside of the picturesque mountain region of georgia he was delighted with his versatility his information and most of all with his glowing love of country and his broad ideas of the future greatness of america when the imposing house stood and when he afterwards occupied the cottage his home was still the boasted showplace of gainesville he was gainesvilles grand historic character her first gentleman and her bestloved citizen whatever resentment towards him because of political views may have been felt in other parts of the country where men were striving to be at the head of state processions in his little home city there was never a break in the loving and proud esteem in which he was held by his home people here life remained interesting to him to the last his heart was ever young when he died he was eightythree years young only a day or two before he was taken away he was planning things that were to take place years in the future blindness deafness paralysis the decay of physical faculties failed to move his dauntless courage or quell his splendid determination general longstreets last days were spent in revising his memoirs of the civil war as were grants in writing his the two colossal characters passed away suffering the excruciating pains of the same dread diseasecancerboth disdaining death heroic to the end on the eve of the spanishamerican war general longstreet was invited by the new york herald to contribute to its columns a paper on the subject of the threatened trouble with spain the closing paragraph of that paper comes across the years a prophecy and prayer for all mankind after an absence of fifty years general longstreet revisited mexico in the eventful summer of 1898 leisurely passing over some of the scenes of his early military experiences half a century had stolen away yet architecturally he found mexico but little changed few of the old landmarks were effaced modern ideas and inventions have been encouraged and do prevail in our sister republic but the dreamlike strangeness of its civilization is still allpervading mexico is not unlike egypt in some respects everywhere is the poetry of a past age egypt has its sphinx and the pyramids to illustrate a mysterious past in mexico we find the temples of the aztecs and the monuments of their cruel conquerors the montezumas have left the impress of their race and civilization on every hand to the northern visitor mexico will always be the land of the aztecs worshippers of the sun to me the battlefields of 184647 were of supreme interest they are to most americans doubtless the chief magnet of attraction but the eye of an active participant in those glorious achievements of american arms sees more as it sweeps over the valley of mexico than is comprehensible to the unprofessional casual observer it was my great privilegetoday a cherished memoryto go over the fields that stretch away from chapultepec with a warworn soldier who fifty years earlier had there learned his first lessons in real warfare mexico will always be a land of romance her civilization stands apart her ruins are yet fragrant with memories of the mighty plans of louis napoleon from the illfated maximilian empire to our own war with mexico seems but a step back and yet between the steps great history has been written excepting vera cruz and cerro gordo the scene of all the leading events of general scotts campaign lie almost within cannonshot of the mexican capital the four battles of contreras churubusco molino del rey and chapultepec which decided the fate of the war occurred within a period of four weeks and within a radius of a dozen miles the mexican general valencia was disastrously routed at contreras august 19 1847 and churubusco was fought and won by the americans next day then there was a short truce between the two belligerents and terms of peace were proposed by an american plenipotentiary these not proving satisfactory hostilities were resumed scott moved with energy on september 8 the battle of molino del rey occurred the americans winning but at heavy sacrifice in killed and wounded the successful assault on chapultepec hill was made on the 13th five days later and on the morning of the 14th scotts splendid little army entered the mexican capital and hoisted its flag over the public buildings the belligerents engaged in these affairs were comparatively small and the losses on both sides very severe the mexicans fought well but were execrably led with the fall of mexico scott had conquered a nation with an army fewer in numbers than the single corps longstreet commanded at gettysburg scotts army for the most part was composed of veteran troopsregulars with a considerable contingent of fine and wellofficered volunteers most of them were already battleseasoned having participated in general taylors initiatory campaign of 1846 on the rio grande where they had signally defeated the mexicans at palo alto resaca de la palma and monterey taylors crowning victory at buena vista february 23 1847 did not occur until after scott had drafted away the best part of his regulars for the march on mexico among them were the fourth and eighth infantry regiments lieutenant longstreet had served in bothin the fourth as brevet second lieutenant after graduating from the military academy in 1842 up to 1845 when he was promoted and transferred to the eighth and he was lucky enough to be with the latter in the action at palo alto may 8 1846 at resaca de la palma next day and in the siege and capture of monterey september 21 to 23 of the same year it was on these fields that most of the young fellows who afterwards became conspicuous in the union and confederate armies flashed their maiden swords in the fourth among longstreets earlier official and social intimates at jefferson barracks and camp salubrity were captain george a mccall lieutenants augur grant alex hays and david a russell all afterwards distinguished union generals captain mccall was then fortythree years old and was graduated from west point in 1822 just twenty years ahead of longstreets class the subsequent civil war produced some singular anticlimaxes to these old mexican war friendships it so happened for instance that sixteen years afterwards at the battle of glendale before richmond longstreets confederate division was pitted against mccalls smaller union division and the confederates had the best of it about dusk after the heavy fighting was over mccall and his staff accidentally rode into the fortyseventh virginia curiously enough the union general alone was captured and brought to longstreets headquarters having for a time been a brevet second lieutenant under mccall in the old fourth infantry and really commiserating his personal mishap general longstreet cordially advanced offering his hand and proffering such hospitality as was permissible in the untoward circumstances but deeply chagrined by his defeat and capture mccall sullenly repelled longstreets friendly advances it only remained for the union general to be sent back to richmond in charge of a staffofficer and guard it was the last meeting between the old captain and his former lieutenant and strangely was mccalls last appearance in battle though he was exchanged in a few weeks he somehow fell into disfavor with the washington authorities resigned in march 1863 and died on a farm near westchester pennsylvania in 1868 mccall was a fine soldier of the old school grant was also a second lieutenant with mccall in the fourth and liked him very much alex hays and longstreet had been associated in both regiments like longstreet hays was promoted and transferred from the fourth to the eighth though upward of a year subsequently grant never left the fourth until he resigned as captain about seven years after the mexican war hays and grant had been friends at west point though not classmates and very chummy afterwards while subs in the old fourth infantry the official personnel of general taylors army scant three thousand men was so small that they were almost like a family everybody knew everybody else hays was detached from the eighth when scott advanced into the valley of mexico but was engaged in several severe affairs in defence of convoys of supplies to the front and also at heamantle and sequaltiplan after that war was over he resigned but in 1861 immediately sought service again and soon rose to the command of a union division his division contributed materially to the repulse of longstreets attack at gettysburg on july 3 but poor hays was killed in front of longstreets lines at the wilderness in 1864 the first battle in virginia after his old comrade grant had assumed command of the union armies such was the fortune of war of the civil struggle the eighth infantry furnished from its mexican war contingent few conspicuous leaders to either side in the subsequent civil war the regiment was compelled to surrender to the local authorities of texas early in 1861 and were detained at the south many months only a few of its old officers then remained all those of southern proclivities had already withdrawn longstreet left the eighth in 1858 ten years after peace with mexico having been promoted to major and paymaster by detention as prisoners of war the union soldiers of the eighth were deprived of the early promotion which fell to the lot of most regulars out of all the officers of the two regiments engaged in mexico only seven it appears espoused the southern cause and of these but three attained to any considerable rank in the confederate armieslongstreet pickett and cadmus e wilcox pickett was a magnificent soldier one of the most daring in the confederate army in the two campaigns of taylor and scott the fourth and eighth lost no fewer than twelve officers killed and fatally wounded and eighteen others seriously wounded a very heavy percentage this alone proves that the americans had no walkover every foot of the ground was bravely contested by the mexicans to continue this digression a little farther it may be said that the genesis of the two mexican campaigns is not well understood winfield scott was and had long been the commanding general of the united states army and entitled as such aside from his military renown to the mexican command but scott a southern whig was ambitious to be president the democratic administration of polk was quite naturally chary of giving scott an opportunity to win public applause through a victorious military campaign scott had early submitted a plan of operations with request for permission to lead an american army into mexico but zachary taylor then only a colonel and brevet brigadier was chosen for the purpose to the discomfiture of scott and his coterie of course the generalinchief chafed because he had thus designedly been overslaughed by a junior the administration overreached itself taylors small victories in northern mexico in the spring of 1846 were so greatly magnified by the press of the states that he at once became the hero of the hour soon he was the open candidate of the whig party for the presidency for taylor like scott was a southern whig polk and his advisers were now between the devil and the deep sea to beat back and neutralize the rising taylor tide they precipitately turned to scott his original plan for bringing mexico to terms via vera cruz was adopted and he assigned to the command with fulsome assurances of ample and continued support which were never fulfilled scott was thereupon given carte blanche to withdraw such force of regulars from taylor as he deemed necessary to the successful prosecution of his proposed invasion and meanwhile taylor with some five thousand volunteers and a slight leaven of regular troops was to remain on the defensive then something happened taylor did not choose to remain stock still but advanced a few weeks after the depletion of his army which began in january 1847 and before scott had landed at vera cruz with his raw volunteers taylor worsted santa anna at buena vista he not only signally defeated the foreign enemy but completed the rout of the democratic administration at washington and the next year was nominated by the whigs and elected president hands down wholly on the strength of his military achievements scott nominated in 1852 was disastrously beaten by the democratic candidate franklin pierce one of his inconspicuous civilian brigadiers in mexico it must have been a galling blow to the old generals pride his defeat was the deathblow of the whig party since those old days general longstreet often speculated on the result if taylor and scott had been required to handle the armies of lee and grant and meet the conditions which confronted the great union and confederate leaders at the crucial periods of their campaigns he concluded that both would have maintained their high reputations at the head of much larger bodies of troops than they marshalled in mexico even though confronted by abler opponents than santa anna supported by stronger and betterdisciplined armies than the halfstarved illappointed levies he brought against them at buena vista and cerro gordo at all events the young fellows of 184647 to a man believed taylor and scott adequately equipped to successfully meet any military emergency they were extraordinary characters both were practised officers dating back to the war of 1812 though neither was a west point graduate scott on the canadian frontier had commanded against considerable bodies of disciplined british troops in pitched battle and came off with increased reputation he had then visited europe and observed the continental armies he was well educated had studied for the bar but by preference took up the military profession of which he was a diligent student scott was thoroughly up in the literature of war to a cultivated mind he added a colossal person and a fine presence general scotts chief fault was an overweening personal vanity which often took the form of mere pedantry not unseldom bringing him into personal ridicule insufferably pompous he invariably maintained a vast unbending dignity both of manner and speech whether oral or written the subalterns of the army looked upon him with absolute awe many a brevetted cadet would readily have chosen to go against a mexican intrenchment rather than into the commanding generals presence he brooked no familiarity from high or low while he sometimes indulged in a sort of elephantine affability he was naturally dictatorial towards all subordinates though always within the limits of decency scotts was not at all the overbearing insolence of the coward he always rode in full uniform with all the insignia of his rank visible to the naked eye such a queer combination of bigness and littleness learning practical ability and whimsicality formed a character sure to create enemies and it must be said that scott had plenty of them both in and out of the army by them he was derisively dubbed old fuss and feathers notwithstanding his weakness the general was physically and morally a very brave man he was cool and deliberate in forming his military plans and once determined upon they were prosecuted with unhesitating energy and precision above all he was an honest man undoubtedly general scott possessed a comprehensive military mind equally cool and careful in planning equally energetic in execution and equally brave honest and true in other respects taylor was an entirely different type of man personally he was the antipodes of the handsome giant scott being only of middle stature his complexion was swarthy and his face rugged and homely but with a kindly expression unlike scott again taylors schooling had been limited yet without any affectation of style he wrote clearly and vigorously from the age of one year he had lived the life of a kentucky frontier farmer boy up to his entry into the army as a lieutenant in 1808 taylors military experience confined wholly to the western border in 1812 was limited to outpost affairs with indians and the few squads of british soldiers and borderers who supported them as an officer he had never met so much as a full company of disciplined soldiers until palo alto taylor never wore his uniform or almost never he dressed in rough clothes no better than those worn by the common soldier he was often seen riding without his staff or other attendant seeing things with his own eyes he was frank and somewhat rough but kindly in speech while he was not without proper dignity he talked and acted straight to the mark without much consideration for appearances he treated his subordinates with easy consideration and was often seen joking and laughing with mere subalterns he was given the sobriquet of old rough and ready by the army in which he was dearly loved by all it was a title which rang through the country in the political campaign of 1848 he not only inspired universal good will rough and uncultivated as he was but confidence such were the two mexican commanders as we gazed down from chapultepecs heights on that fragrant day of 1898 across the beautiful valley of mexico the war of fifty years agone seemed but yesterday to him who on those fields had added a new star of the first magnitude to the galaxy of american valor memories of the glorious past rushed through his mind here grant and lee had taken their first lessons in practical warfare on a considerable scale here had been won not only texas but the vast domain away to the pacific since then what social industrial and political revolutions had he not witnessed from the mississippi had spread out a great republic reaching from ocean to ocean he had seen the southern confederacy rise and fall and colossal history along the way from chapultepec to manila written in the blood of the nations strong men and mexico has not been behind in the mighty changes that have swept over the continent since her bitter humiliation in 1847 she has advanced by heroic strides especially under the wise leadership of diaz but after all it was not wholly the great events of half a century that crowded upon general longstreets memory at this interesting juncture curiously enough his mind persisted in fixing itself upon minor incidentssocial and personal relationson the comrades who had here and elsewhere laid down their lives in the service on others who had risen to distinction or dropped out of the running the boys of 46 and 47 again crowded upon him it could hardly be otherwise for they were a band of brothers then when general taylors little army of observation was collected in western louisiana the whole regular establishment of the united states consisted of no more than 12139 officers and men the army of occupation which was concentrated at corpus christi texas in the fall of 1845 numbered only three thousand men the days of corpus christi still formed a vivid picture in general longstreets mind the oldest officers presenteven general taylor himselfhad never seen so large a body of the regular army together adjoining the camp were extensive level prairies admirably adapted to military manuvres many of the officers had not taken part in even a battalion drill since leaving west point and with most of them evolutions of the line had only been read in tactics so widely had the troops been scattered and in such small detachments to meet the requirements of the countrys extensive frontiers that there were colonels who had never seen their entire regiments this concentration afforded opportunity for practical professional instruction and discipline which was appreciated and availed of but with this preparatory work there were amusements and lasting friendships were formed perhaps a few equally lasting enmities game and fish abounded there were no settlements the country was absolutely wild within a few hours ride of the camps were wild turkeys in flocks of twenty to forty deer and antelope were numerous and not far afield were vast droves of wild mustangs wolves and coyotes were everywhere and occasionally a mexican lion cougar was found many of the young officers became expert hunters muzzleloading shotguns were used mainly there were no breechloaders in those days the camp tables fairly groaned with game dishes wild turkey and venison finally so palled upon many of the soldiers as actually to become distasteful and the old reliable beef and pork of the commissariat was resorted to in preference wild horses were lassoed and brought into camp by mexicans and tame indians and sold to the americans for two or three dollars a head an extra good animal would sometimes bring twelve dollars which was the tiptop price a good many were purchased by the quartermaster for the use of the army and proved very serviceable these animals looked something like the norman breed they had heavy manes and tails and were much more powerful than the plains ponies farther north of a later date they foraged for themselves and flourished where the american horse would deteriorate and soon die lieutenant grant of the fourth had acquired great reputation at the military academy as an expert horseman he was always the show rider upon great occasions he greatly added to this reputation at corpus christi he was regimental quartermaster and had much to do with these horses he bought several of the better class for his own use while riding one and leading the others to water one day just before the army moved to the rio grande his colored servant lost the whole bunch or perhaps sold them for his own account he claimed that throwing him off they jerked loose and stampeded away there was a joke among the boys that upon being told of the incident general taylor humorously remarked yes i understand mr grant lost five or six dollars worth of horses recently satirically referring to their extraordinary cheapness grant declined to buy more horses for his private use soon after the army advanced to the rio grande and foot officers had no use for horses the unpretentious grant was soon famous throughout the army as a bronco buster in the sense the term is now familiarly used he would unhesitatingly mount and soon bring to terms the most vicious of wild horses on horseback he was a very centaur in no other manner could an animal unhorse grant than by lying down and rolling over a large group of interested officers one day had opportunity to observe his success in dealing with an unbroken horse an indian had brought to camp a splendid specimen which had struck grants fancy and for which he paid the record price of twelve dollars it seemed to prance on springs of steel its beautiful head was carried on high and the noble eyes shot sparks of fire while two grooms held it by lariats from either side grant blindfolded the stallion then the regulation accoutrements of spanish saddle and heavybitted bridle were adjusted and grant mounted his heels armed with an enormous pair of mexican spurs thus blindfolded the beautiful animal had stood stock still trembling like an aspen the instant his eyes were uncovered he sprang forward like a shot grant held his seat firmly then the horse began to buckthat is to jump high into the air at the same moment suddenly crooking his back upward with intent to throw off his burden this was repeated time after time of course without dislodging grant who was up to that sort of thing the proceeding was greeted by the bystanders with shouts of laughter and yells of hang on grant dont let him down you old boy etc the animal presently tired of this work and at the proper juncture the coolheaded rider vigorously applied the spurs at the same time loosening the rein when the stallion plunged straight forward at a breakneck pace through the chaparral and cacti of the plain the soldiers watched them until they disappeared and the uninitiated wondered if they should ever see grant alive again two hours later they returned at a slow walk both exhausted the horses head down and his sides wet with sweat and foam he was conquered and was thereafter as docile as any welltrained american horse when not on duty grants chief amusement at corpus christi was horseback riding he was no sportsman and only occasionally played brag for small stakes longstreets classmate lieutenant benjamin of the fourth artillery came in one day with a story about grants one attempt at gunning for turkeys the two on a short leave with other officers had made a journey on horseback to austin late in the fall of 1845 accompanying a train of supplies returning the party was reduced to threebenjamin grant and lieutenant augur afterwards majorgeneral in the union army augur fell sick and was left at goliad to be picked up by a train following at goliad grant and benjamin went out to shoot turkeys benjamin was a good shot and soon returned to camp with several fine birds he found grant already in but without any game the latter said that a large flock of turkeys had taken flight in twos and threes from branches of the pecantrees overhead some of them calmly looking at him several moments before taking wing he had watched them with much interest until the last turkey had disappeared then it suddenly occurred to him that he had come out to shoot turkeys i concluded benjamin from this circumstance explained grant with much chagrin that i was not cut out for a sportsman so i returned to the house confident you would bring in plenty of birds this explanation was offered with the utmost simplicity and benjamin repeated it with much unction poor benjamin did not live to see the heights of fame reached by the little lieutenant who did not know enough to shoot wild turkeys in 1845 he was killed at the storming of the city of mexico september 13 1847 these anecdotes of a distinguished man naturally find place in a potpourri paper of this kind but their special purpose is to show grants personal characteristics and in some sort the estimate placed upon him by his comrades of sixty years ago but in those days the young fellows of the army fooled away no time in estimating upon the intellectual capacity of even the most promising associate grant was just simply an unobtrusive everyday second lieutenant without special promise or remarkable traits it must be said that no one looked upon him then as the coming great man of the greatest war of civilized times rather quiet seldom seeking crowds grant nevertheless enjoyed his friends and among them was both a voluble and interesting talker the alleged taciturnity of the later time was assumed to shut off busybodiesit was only judicious reticence he was quickly known as a very brave and enterprising soldier in action and in fact distinguished himself under both taylor and scott he and longstreet were intimate friends from 1839 through the seven years ending with the mexican war and often met in friendliest relations after the civil war grant never forgot a friend in need it was not until grant came east during the civil war that longstreet began to fully appreciate his military ability grants successes at donelson shiloh and vicksburg were but vaguely understood in the army of northern virginia where they were mainly ascribed to bad generalship on the confederate side and some blundering good luck on grants part but after the war was over and access was had to the inside history of those events longstreet soon perceived that the vicksburg campaign was one of the greatest in military history and that pembertons destruction was almost wholly due to grants bold conception of the military requirements to fulfil the expectations of his government longstreet had been near by when grant attacked and defeated bragg at chattanooga and also thought that victory was largely due to overwhelming numbers and braggs incapacity to perceive the impending storm longstreet wrote to general lee from east tennessee some time in the winter of 186364 that he need have no fear of grant then presumptively booked for the army of the potomac that he was overestimated largely from his prestige acquired against inferior commanders etc but in the very beginning of the wilderness campaign in 1864 the commander of the first corps of the army of northern virginia saw a power displayed in manuvring the army of the potomac which the confederates had never met before there is no doubt that general lee himself appreciated that he had a new and puzzling force to deal with at the wilderness lee assumed the offensive the moment grant crossed the rapidan essaying the same tactics that had been practised upon hooker at chancellorsville but he failed the confederates withstood grant in the wilderness but it was the last time general lee attempted a general offensive this was somewhat due to his inferior numbers and waning morale but it was mainly because of grants presence the year before after what was practically a drawn battle at chancellorsville hooker with double lees force withdrew across the river he had between twentyfive thousand and thirty thousand men who had scarcely fired a gun in battle grant with fewer men than hooker fought a larger confederate army at the wilderness it too was no more than a drawn battle yet grant had no thought of recrossing the river to recuperate he moved forward and immediately put general lee on the defensive general lee at last realized that the confederacys only hope was defensive battle and his fame as a general will rest wholly on that campaign if he had persisted in the tactics employed against hooker and pope and mcclellan his army would have been destroyed in ten days after the wilderness grant really had the army of northern virginia on the go on the morning of the 6th of may it was saved from utter rout only by the timely arrival of the first corps which rolled back hancocks victorious lines upon the brock road and beyond among general longstreets pleasant memories of camp life at corpus christi was a rude theatre erected by a joint stock company of the young officers who acted in the plays produced on its boards taking both male and female parts many roaring comedies were billed and cheered the garrison from time to time the enlisted men were of course permitted to pay the entrance fee and see the best that was going general worth was always a delighted auditor general taylor occasionally honored the entertainments with his presence and general twiggs rarely after exhausting the field of comedy and having already reimbursed themselves for all outlays the officers concluded to enter the more expensive and difficult field of tragedy the first play chosen was the moor of venice lieutenant porter brother of admiral porter was assigned the part of othello whilst lieutenant longstreet was nominated for desdemona but upon inspection the manager protested that six feet dignified in crinoline would not answer even for a tragic heroine so longstreet was discarded and grant substituted finally after a rehearsal or two grant too had to give way under protests of porter that male tragediennes could not give the proper sentiment to the play then the officers chipped in and sent to new orleans for a real actress and thereafter all went well the play was pulled off eventually with as much clat as followed general taylors first victory a few months later on the rio grande a volume could be filled with incidents of those sunny days on the mexican gulf the incipient stage of the first campaign in real war for the young officers they gave little heed of the morrow their pay was small but their requirements were on even a less scale there was a good deal of drilling but otherwise their duties were far from onerous a large proportion of the cadets longstreet had known at west point from 1838 to 1842 were there congregated and old associations were renewed of course all these officers were not intimates but nearly all were personal acquaintances on the most friendly footing every one brought his share to the common aggregate of interest and pleasure among the officers there collected who afterwards became prominent in the union and confederate armies in addition to those already mentioned were william j hardee thomas jordan john c pemberton braxton bragg earl van dorn samuel g french richard h anderson robert s garnett barnard e bee bushrod r johnson abram c myers lafayette mclaws and e kirby smith of the confederate service and j k f mansfield george g meade don carlos buell george h thomas n j t dana charles f smith joseph j reynolds john f reynolds abner doubleday alfred pleasanton thomas j wood seth williams and george sykes distinguished union generals in the civil war there were many others too numerous to mention longstreet afterwards met many of these officers as mortal foes on the field of battle he served with others in the confederate armies and others served under him mclaws and pickett were long fighting division commanders in his corps robert e lee george b mcclellan g t beauregard and joseph e johnston were not with taylor and they and others notably e r s canby isaac i stevens and john g foster did not join the army until scotts campaign opened in 1847 though it appears that lee was with general wools column in the movement towards chihuahua they were among the great names of the subsequent civil war jefferson davis colonel of the mississippi rifles joined taylor after scott had withdrawn the regulars but in time to turn the tide of battle at buena vista altogether it was a brilliant roster they were all graduates of the military academy of all the officers collected at corpus christi it is doubtful if there is today a score of survivors a large number were killed in action a far greater number died of disease in the mexican or civil war campaigns besides the long list of west pointers there were at corpus christi many regulars appointed from civil life meritorious officers who afterwards made their mark one of these was lawrence p graham a virginian already a captain in the second dragoons he was some six years longstreets senior after mexico graham stuck to the old army rose to the colonelcy of the fourth cavalry in 1864 and was a union brigadier of volunteers he had been in the army nearly ten years when the mexican war broke out he still survives at the green old age of eightyeight a retired colonel since 1870 thirtythree years he has been carried on the rolls of the united states army nearly sixtyseven years that is one of the rewards for having been lucky enough to espouse the winning side in 1861 but selfinterest had little to do with the choice of sides conscience pointed the way in that hour of passion the reunion at corpus christi made a deep impression upon the fledglings of the service the long encampment there formed a green spot in the memory of the little army that bore our colors in triumph to the city of mexico those who have left memoirs of their military careers have to a man dwelt largely upon the various interesting though generally unimportant incidents of this delightful episode march 1846 brought the hour of their ending on the 9th the bugles of the line sounded the assembly and in obedience to instructions from washington general taylor put his army in motion by easy stages for the line of the rio grande river that movement immediately produced a result which the government had long secretly desiredwar negotiations for the amicable possession of texas and the territory to the pacific had failed it is not the purpose of this paper to write the history of the mexican war but a few of its salient features may be recounted perhaps with profit under the texas treaty of annexation and the act admitting texas into the american union the united states claimed all the territory down to the rio grande and westward to the border of new mexico mexico on her part denied that texas was a free agent although president santa anna captured by the texans the next day after the battle of san jacinto in 1836 while in durance had consented to a treaty which acknowledged texan independence texas had adopted a constitution and set up an independent government mexico repudiated santa annas agreement but nevertheless had subsequently never been able to conquer the lost territory the entrance of the american troops into texas was therefore by mexico considered a casus belli and her troops under general arista crossed the river and began aggressive war upon the united states detachments as soon as they reached the vicinity the mexican general torrejon captured a detachment of united states dragoons april 25 including captains thornton and hardee and lieutenant kane besides killing lieutenant george j mason and sixteen men mason was a classmate of longstreet thornton hardee and kane were well treated and soon after exchanged small bands of mexicans committed other depredations shortly after the unfortunate incident above recited lieutenant theodoric porter and a small party were fired upon from an ambuscade in the chaparral and porter and one soldier killed porter had been one of the theatrical stars at corpus christi the march to point isabel the siege of fort brown by general ampudia and the stirring affairs at palo alto and resaca soon followed the spirit of camaraderie and patriotic zeal which animated the army of occupation was vividly illustrated when captain charles may was ordered by taylor at resaca de la palma to charge a mexican battery as may drew up his own and grahams squadrons for the work lieutenant randolph ridgely of ringgolds artillery called out hold on charlie till i draw their fire and he turned loose with his six guns upon the enemy the return fire was prompt but ridgelys wise purpose was accomplished then the invincible heroism with which may rushed forward at the head of a handful of the second dragoons signalized the qualities which unerringly foreshadowed the result of that war the opposing battery was secured in the twinkling of an eye and the mexican general la vega captured amid his guns mays gallant exploit was the theme of the army may ridgely and longstreet were close friends of the trio longstreet being youngest in years and service ridgely was killed at monterey that fall may lived until 1864 having resigned in 1861 he took no part in the civil war the first successes of the mexican war were easy and decisive the real hardships began with the march over the sterile wastes towards monterey monterey was equally as decisive but it was found to be a much harder nut to crack and here the american losses were very heavy the general effect of taylors operations in conjunction with wolfs campaign and the overland march of general kearny to california was demoralizing to the mexicans when it was learned that two divisions of taylors army had been ordered to the coast there was much speculation at the front as to the meaning of the movement the younger contingent immediately jumped to the conclusion that the war was over and that twiggss and pattersons troops were ordered home this proved not to be the case but the army was not much disappointed to learn that another campaign farther south was projected there was some friction between taylor and scott over the withdrawal of the regulars some of scotts letters to taylor miscarried and scott pressed for time was compelled to order the troops he wanted down to the coast without taylors knowledge the latter at times being far in the interior when taylor learned that his best troops had been ordered away without an hours previous notice the old general was naturally very much incensed he was afterwards somewhat mollified when he received scotts delayed correspondence and saw that his chief had endeavored to reach him in the proper spirit scott was the senior and of course it was for him to order besides scott himself had orders from the president to withdraw the troops taylor however made both to scott and the secretary of war a sharp protest against the manner of carrying out the design doubtless taylor felt sore upon learning that the administration intended leaving him upon the defensive without means to continue his victorious advance buena vista a few weeks later probably melted the old fellows rancor into sardonic satisfaction once started the troops rapidly retrograded to the rio grande the weather was fairly cool and the marches made from twenty to twentyeight miles per day one rather warm day while the troops were on this move a burnt district was passed over and the heat and flying smoke and ashes choked the tired men and officers when the column camped it was upon a beautiful mountain stream into which all rushed for a bath first lieutenant sydney smith of the fourth one of the first to start for the water while passing through the timber which fringed the stream was attacked by peccaries a species of wild pig common in mexico they are not very large but travel in droves and are very fierce they treed smith upon a lowhanging limb barely out of reach of his excited pursuers the limb was very slender for his weight and as he swung to the ground the maddened peccaries reared upon their hind feet and snapped savagely at smiths pendent feet and legs the woods were now full of the officers and men going to the stream and a party soon relieved smith from his precarious perch smith was a brave fellow he was the next year wounded at molino del rey and within a week after killed at the attack on belen gate there was a considerable delay at the mouth of the river awaiting transports the point of assemblage of the troops from new orleans mobile and taylors army was lobos island some three hundred miles south of the rio grandes mouth the march began january 9 1847 but it was not until about february 12 that the first of the regulars sailed from the rio grande to lobos island scott had expected the concentration at lobos to have been completed three weeks earlier the fault was in the transport service the fleet did not leave lobos island until march 2 a week later a landing was effected near vera cruz and on the 10th the first guns of the new campaign were heardshots from the castle of san juan de ulloa at worths troops encamped upon the sandhills the investment of the city was speedily completed and siege operations begun the army heard of taylors remarkable victory at buena vista on the 15th of march it took away their breath to learn that santa anna had marched a great army against taylor after they had left and had been defeated it explained why there had been so little opposition to the landing of the american forces vera cruz surrendered on the 29th then the march into the interior of mexico began led by twiggss division the first objective point was jalapa scotts design was to get upon the mountain plateau before the yellowfever season approached on the coast it was deadly in that region the precision with which scotts plans were carried forward and their uniform success made a profound impression upon the army his reputation was very high before he had struck the first blow but after vera cruz no one of that army doubted that he would soon enter the mexican capital the armys morale was high from the outset it was small consequently but little bothered with the impedimenta which make the movements of a large army so slow and oftentimes tortuous it marched rapidly and scott sent it square at the mark every time occasion offered nevertheless there was great delay in the advance to the valley of mexico operations were very energetic in the beginning the battle of cerro gordo occurred on the 18th of april where a complete and technically brilliant victory was won it was here santa anna already returned from his illfated movement against taylor undertook to defend the passage of the mountains against scotts advance after careful reconnoissances the american general turned his position attacked his flank and after a short fight broke up his army in utter rout very nearly cutting off and capturing the whole as it was the americans captured about four thousand prisoners fortythree cannon and three thousand five hundred smallarms all this was done with a force of less than nine thousand americans against some twelve thousand mexicans strongly fortified this extraordinary victory opened the road to the valley thus within twenty days scott had effected a landing captured vera cruz signally defeated the enemy in pitched battle and taken the road into the heart of mexico jalapa was entered on the 20th at jalapa seven regiments of volunteers were discharged and the american force was too greatly reduced to attack the capital the enforcements promised did not arrive the advance however was pushed on to puebla a city then of some seventy thousand inhabitants which was occupied by worth on the 15th of may lieutenant longstreet was with the division occupying puebla here there was a long wait of weeks for the required forces to attack the capital now less than three marches away from jalapa scott set out for the front on may 23 arriving at puebla on the 28th many of the higher officers rode out to meet and give the general a proper reception and he entered the city in considerable state el generalissimo el generalissimo was shouted by the citizens as the generalinchief rode through the streets to his headquarters the army welcomed him with enthusiasm it was at the siege of vera cruz and the operations at cerro gordo that the engineer officers r e lee g b mcclellan i i stevens g t beauregard and others began to attract the notice of the line taylor had made little use of engineers in northern mexico he largely depended upon his own practised military eye to determine positions either for the offensive or defensive scotts methods were entirely different he depended more upon reconnoissances led by his staff engineers and their reports of situations approaches etc he saw largely through the eyes of these officers and his fine strategy was based on their information hence under scott the engineer officers soon began to fill a large space in the eyes of the army they became familiar figures longstreets personal acquaintanceship with lee began in this campaign he was graduated from the academy no 2 of the class of 1829 nine years before longstreet entered it lee was already a captain of engineers when longstreet entered as a cadet in 1838 he was past forty when the american forces landed before vera cruz so in years he was much older as in rank and prestige he was away above the line subalterns of that campaign many of whom subsequently served under him and against him in 186165 he evinced great admiration even reverence for scotts generalship in afteryears his admirers claimed that much of scotts glory was due to lees military ability scott gave him great praise but while lee was much respected in the army it is due to say that nobody then ascribed the victories of american arms to him besides which colonel joseph g totten was scotts chiefengineer and lee had another superior present in the person of major j l smith the army thought general scott entitled to the full credit of leadership in the campaign of 1847 about august 14 sufficient reinforcements had arrived to warrant another forward movement scott had now about ten thousand men with more coming on from the coast his army was composed of four divisions commanded by generals twiggs worth pillow and quitman the two latter volunteer majorgenerals the army began its final advance on the 8th of august 1847 it had been idle nearly three months awaiting the action of the government it was general longstreets opinion that with five thousand more men scott could have followed santa anna straight into mexico from cerro gordo owing to dilatoriness in raising troops at home his active force at puebla was at one time reduced to five thousand men the three months halt gave the demoralized enemy time to recover courage and recruit their numbers the american advance from puebla to the valley of mexico was over the rio frio mountain the pass is over eleven thousand feet above the ocean it was easily susceptible of successful defence but the experience of the mexicans at cerro gordo probably led their generals to conclude that scotts strategy was irresistible in a mountain region at any rate there was no resistance and after a toilsome climb of three days in the mountains the americans debouched into the beautiful valley without firing a shot this valley is one of the most singular of natural features it is simply a basin in the mountains without any visible outlet in seasons of heavy rainfall and snowfall on the stupendous mountains which surround it the small lakes in this basin overflow and sometimes inundate the capital itself it is only in recent years that a channel or tunnel has been cut to drain off the superfluous water in time of need at some time in the past the basin was probably a lake there must have been some unknown subterranean outlet which originally drained it down and afterwards prevented it refilling before the artificial drain was made however there were indubitable signs that the lakes were much smaller than in the beginning of the sixteenth century when corts conquered the aztec capital the bed of this valley is seven thousand feet above the sea level there are five shallow lakes in the basin the capital is located on the west side of lake tezcuco it contained about two hundred thousand people in 1847 the army entered the valley from the east at first aiming to pass between lakes chalco and tezcuco but the fortified hill of el penyon and other obstructions made that approach very difficult if not impossible and after the engineers had examined the ground scott concluded to pass around to the southward of lake chalco and xochimilco the movement was inaugurated on the 15th of august four days after entering the valley on the 17th the border of lake xochimilco was skirted and that night worth bivouacked in san augustin the tlalpan of corts on the road approaching the capital from the south and west of the lakes it became for the time the depot and base of the army these preliminary movements consumed a weeks time on the 18th the brilliant action of contreras was fought here scott outmanuvred the enemy completely employing again the cerro gordo tactics and striking him in flank and rear the routed mexicans fled back to the fortified lines about churubusco many prisoners were captured at contreras the attack was pressed against the position of churubusco on the 19th and 20th resulting in the severest battle of the war except perhaps buena vista longstreets regiment the eighth infantry of which he was adjutant here distinguished itself aiding in the capture of many prisoners and some guns at one crucial point longstreet had the proud honor to carry forward the regimental colors mentioned in worths despatches after the surrender some of the prisoners attempted to escape by a rush and many of them did get away others were shot down and some were recaptured a company of americans who had deserted the year before from taylors army and joined the mexicans were here captured in a body their resistance had caused severe loss to the american army they were tried for desertion found guilty and a score or so of them shot to death scott won churubusco with less than nine thousand men the routed enemy fled into the city and to the fortified hill of chapultepec and were followed pell mell by the american cavalry it was in this charge that phil kearny lost his arm he was afterwards killed at chantilly in popes campaign of 1862 a union majorgeneral the americans could certainly have entered the city that day on the heels of the flying foe but scott thought it wisest to hold back and not disperse the mexican government to give the american peace commissioner mr trist an opportunity to propose terms an armistice followed but the mexican government declined the basis of peace proposed the americans were in possession of the whole country practically at least there was nothing left to successfully oppose their occupation of its territory to the farthest limits yet after these victories they proposed to take only texas new mexico and california and to pay for them a large sum of money texas was counted our own before the war began the terms of our government were so liberal that the mexicans probably suspected that there was alarm for the result of future operations perhaps they judged the terms would be no worse after another trial of arms and they were not molino del rey and chapultepec followed on september 8 and 13 respectively at the first affair the americans lost seven hundred and eightyseven men in the two hours of severe fighting but won a complete victory as usual the fight was made by worths division and longstreets regiment was engaged of course thus far he had got through without a scratch scotts army at the outset not overlarge for the contract he had undertaken was now very much reduced but its morale was still fine it was a critical question to determine the point of attack on the city on the 11th there was a council of nearly all the generals and engineer officers at piedad major smith captain lee and lieutenants tower and stevens of the engineers reported in favor of attacking the san antonio or southern gate generals quitman shields pierce and cadwalader concurred general scott on the contrary favored the chapultepec route and general twiggs supported the generalinchief alone of the engineers lieutenant beauregard favored the chapultepec route after hearing beauregards reasons general pierce changed his opinion at the conclusion of the conference general scott said we will attack chapultepec and then the western gate the hill of the grasshopper chapultepec is an isolated mound rising one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet above the valley nearly precipitous in some parts it slopes off gradually to the westward heavy batteries frowned from its salient positions sweeping the approaches from all directions to the southward the ground was marshy the position was regarded by both belligerents as the key to the capital the american batteries opened fire upon chapultepec on the 12th causing great destruction and killing and wounding many of its defenders the mexican leader santa anna a very brave fellow with only one leg was under this heavy fire for a time taking observations of its effect on the 13th this fire was resumed followed by an assault of infantry the volunteers of quitman and pillow led by picked storming parties made the assault on two fronts the hill was carried with a rush after scott gave the signal of attack pillow calling for reinforcements longstreets brigade was ordered forward by general worth and he went into the enemys works on the hill with the others longstreet did not quite reach the works for while rushing up the hill with the regimental flag in his hands he was severely wounded by a musketball through the thigh the castle all the enemys guns and many prisoners were captured general scott rode to the summit soon after and surveyed the work of his gallant army it was well done general worth chased the fleeing enemy to the citys gates after longstreet fell george e pickett carried the flag to the works on the hill and to the top of the castle the old eighths flag was hoisted from the staff which but a month before flaunted the mexican banner this was the last action in the valley there was some fighting at the gates and desultory firing from the houses as the american troops pushed in but the city fell without much loss after chapultepec the mexicans evacuated the capital that night and general scott entered the next day the mexican war was practically over in a few months a treaty was made giving the united states about what was demanded by mr trist after churubusco in august the united states salving up mexicos wounded pride with fifteen million dollars with several wounded comrades longstreet was assigned quarters with the escandons a kindhearted refined mexican family they could not conceal their deep chagrin at the defeat of their army and were doubtless mortified by the enforced presence of the wounded americans nevertheless they insisted that those officers confined to their beds should be supplied from their own table delicacies without stint were sent the days of confinement were greatly brightened by their delicate attentions on the 1st of december the accomplished surgeons satterlee and deleon thought that longstreet was strong enough to travel and announced that he was to be ordered out of the country on sickleave with others he left mexico on december 9 a few days later he sailed from vera cruz with a large number of sick and wounded among whom was brigadiergeneral pierce who was very popular in the army after reaching home longstreet soon regained his strength he then wrote to colonel john garland of virginia his late brigade commander asking for his youngest daughter colonel garland promptly replied yes with all my heart he had won fame in mexico and returned home on leave a month before longstreet was well enough to travel and was then with his family the young lady and her soldier sweetheart already had a pretty good understanding on the subject and her answer was equally flattering on the 8th of march 1848 the marriage occurred at lynchburg after a brief honeymoon orders were received from the war department detailing longstreet for recruiting service with station at poughkeepsie new york before autumn of that year nearly all the troops in mexico were withdrawn and the eighth longstreets old regiment was ordered to jefferson barracks st louis where he had been stationed before the war then a brevet second lieutenant in the fourth after fifty years general longstreet found that many of the physical details of the battle terrain in the valley of mexico differed quite materially from the memory conveyed by his younger eyes in the heat of action there was no real change in fixed landmarks but the depressions were not so deep nor the impregnable hills the americans attacked so high as they appeared when the mexicans were defending them with sword musket and cannon in instants of supreme danger it is very difficult for the soldier or subordinate officer to see things exactly as they are on a battlefield his eye and mind are inevitably and anxiously concentrated on the enemy or the battery that is dealing death and destruction round about the armies that prepared for the first grand conflict of the civil war were commanded by west point graduates both of the class of 1838beauregard and mcdowell the latter had been assigned to the command of the federal forces at washington south of the potomac in the latter part of may 1861 the former had assumed command of the confederates at manassas junction about the 1st of june to him brigadiergeneral longstreet reported for duty mcdowell marched on the afternoon of the 16th of july at the head of an army of five divisions of infantry supplemented by nine batteries of the regular service one of volunteers besides two guns operating separately and seven companies of regular cavalry in his infantry columns were eight companies of regulars and a battalion of marinesan aggregate of thirtyfive thousand men beauregard stood behind bull run with seven brigades including holmes who joined on the 19th twentynine guns and fourteen hundred cavalryan aggregate of twentyone thousand nine hundred men all volunteers to this should be added for the battle of the 21st reinforcements aggregating eight thousand five hundred men under general johnston making the sum of the aggregate thirty thousand four hundred men the line behind bull run was the best between washington and the rapidan for strategy tactics and army supplies general longstreet always believed that by vigorous and concentrated work the confederates after the battle of the first manassas might have followed mcdowells fleeing columns into washington and held the capital but this is not a part of my story on the eve of the battle the confederates had occasional glimpses behind the lines about washington through parties who managed to evade the eyes of guards and sentinels which told of mcdowells work since may and heard on the 10th of july that he was ready to march most of the confederates knew him and of his attainments as well as those of beauregard to the credit of the latter and on that point they were satisfied but the backing of an organized government and an army led by the foremost american warchiefthat consummate strategist tactician and organizer general scotttogether with the splendid equipment of the field batteries and the presence of the force of regulars of infantry gave serious apprehension a gentleman who was a boy in washington during the civil war said not long ago in speaking of the first manassas that he would never forget the impression made upon his youthful mind by mcdowells army in moving towards manassas junction their arms glistened in the sunshine the new uniforms added to the splendid bearing of the ranks the horses were garlanded with flowers the silken folds of regimental flags lifted caressingly by the breezes of midsummer made an ocean of color above the noble columns it was an inspiring sight every flag in the capital was a beckoning call to arms in the nations defence mcdowells army seemed setting out for some festal occasion and gayly moved to the sound of music and song but oh what a different sight after manassas when his weary and routed columns straggled back to washington before the victorious confederates their gala day had been of short duration on the 16th of july the confederates learned that the advance of mcdowells army was under definite orders for next day longstreets brigade was at once ordered into position at blackburns ford and all others were ordered on the alert at eight oclock am on the 18th mcdowells army concentrated about centerville his immediate objective being manassas junction his orders to general tyler commanding the advance division were to look well to the roads on the direct route to manassas junction and via the stone bridge to impress an advance upon the former but to have care not to bring on a general engagement under the instructions as general tyler construed them he followed the confederates to the heights of centerville overlooking the valley of bull run with a squadron of cavalry and two companies of infantry from the heights to the run a mile away the field was open and partially disclosed the confederate position on his right on the left the view was limited by a sparse growth of spreading pines the enemy was far beyond the range of confederate guns his position commanding as well as his metal so longstreet ordered the guns withdrawn to a place of safety till a fair opportunity was offered them the guns were limbered and off before a shot reached them artillery practice of thirty minutes was followed by an advance of infantry the march was quite up to the bluff overlooking the ford when both sides opened fire the first pouringdown volleys were most startling to the new troops part of longstreets line broke and started at a run to stop the alarm he rode with sabre in hand for the leading files determined to give them all that was in the sword and his horses heels or stop the break they seemed to see as much danger in their rear as in front and soon turned and marched back to their places to the evident surprise of the enemy heavy firing was renewed in ten or fifteen minutes when the federals retired after about twenty minutes a second advance was made to the top of the bluff when another rousing fusilade followed and continued about as long as the first with like result longstreet reinforced the front line with part of his reserve and thinking to follow up his next success called for one of the regiments of the reserve brigade the combat lasted about an hour when the federals withdrew to their ground about centerville to the delight of the confederates who felt themselves christened veterans their artillery being particularly proud of the combat against the famed batteries of the united states regulars general mcdowells order for the battle on the 21st of july was issued on the afternoon of the 20th beauregards order for battle approved by general johnston was issued at five am on the 21st the orders for marching were only preliminary coupled with the condition that the troops were to be held ready to move but to wait for special order for action the brigade at blackburns ford had been reinforced by the fifth north carolina and twentyfourth virginia regiments under lieutenant jones and colonel kemper longstreet crossed the run under the five oclock order adjusted the regiments to position for favorable action and gave instructions for their movements on the opening of the battle this first clash of arms tested the fighting qualities of the confederates but the soil was virginia and for them it was to be death or victory the close of the battle of the 21st found the federals beaten and fleeing towards the shelter of their capital they had fought stubbornly mcdowell made a gallant effort to recover his lost power riding with his troops and urging them to brave effort although his renewed efforts were heroic his men seemed to have given confidence over to despair when fight was abandoned and flight ensued over the contested field of the first battle of the war longstreet had borne the victorious banners of the south this battle was fairly fought and dearly won by the confederacy may 5 1862 general joseph e johnston was chief in command and general longstreet had the active direction of the battle the battle was fought by sickless federal third corps that heroically contested every inch of the ground it was at the close of the battle that general hancock distinguished himself by holding his position in and about the forts with five regiments and two batteries against the assault of the fifth north carolina and twentyfourth virginia regiments and it was on this field that he won the title of the superb given to him by mcclellan in his report the object of the battle on the part of the confederates was to gain time to haul their trains to places of safety the effect besides was to call two of the federal divisions from their flanking move to support the battle thereby greatly crippling their expedition general mcclellan was at yorktown during most of the day to see several of the divisions of his army aboard the transports for his proposed flanking and rear move up york river upon receiving advice that the williamsburg engagement was serious and unsatisfactory he hastened to the battle with the divisions of sedgwick and richardson which he had expected to send up the river there were about nine thousand confederates and twelve thousand union troops engaged the confederate casualties were 1565 the federal casualties 2288 johnston had anticipated mcclellans move up the york river and considered it very important to cripple or break it up therein he used the divisions of longstreet magruder d r jones mclaws g w smith and d h hill there was a tremendous downpour of rain the night before the battle flooding thoroughfares byways woodlands and fields so that many of the confederate trains were unable next day to move out of the bogs that were developed during the night general hookers division of the third corps on the federal side came to the open on the hampton road and engaged by regimentsthe first massachusetts on the left the second new hampshire on the right after the advance of his infantry in the slashes general hooker with the eleventh massachusetts and twentysixth pennsylvania cleared the way for communication with the troops on the yorktown road and ordered webbers sixgun battery into action as it burst from the woods through which it had come the confederate infantry and every gun in reach opened upon it a fire so destructive that it was unmanned before it came into practice new federal troops immediately came to the rescue and the guns reopened fire osborns and bramhalls batteries joined in and the two poured an unceasing fire into the confederate troops about the fort and redoubts the fifth new jersey regiment was added to the battery guard and the sixth seventh and eighth were deployed on the left in the woodland the brigades of r h anderson wilcox pryor a p hill and pickett were taking care of the confederate side general longstreet hearing the swelling noise of battle rode to the front and ordered colstons brigade and the batteries of deering and stribling to follow as well as stuarts horse artillery under pelham it soon became evident that the fight was for the day d h hill was asked to return with the balance of his division hooker was bracing the fight on his left he directed emory to reconnoitre on his extreme left grover was called to reinforce the fighting in the edge of the woods several new york regiments came into the action but the confederates nevertheless continued to gain ground until they got short of ammunition while holding their line some of the regiments retired a little to fill their cartridgeboxes from those of the fallen enemy and their fallen comrades this move was misconstrued into an order to withdraw and the confederate line fell back but the mistake was soon discovered and the lost ground regained the eleventh massachusetts twentysixth pennsylvania and second new hampshire came into the action on the confederate side colstons brigade the florida regiment and the mississippi battalion came to the rescue and general anderson who was in immediate charge grouped his forces made a concentrated move upon the federal batteries cleared them of the gunners and captured four of webbers guns and forty horses general stuart rode up about this time decided that the federals were in retreat and insisted upon a charge and pursuit he was however convinced that federal reinforcements were coming up and that the break was only of their front line about three oclock kearnys division came to the federal aid before the reinforcements arrived for hookers relief anderson had established his advanced line of skirmishers so as to cover with their fire webbers guns that were abandoned the federal reinforcing column drove back his advance lines then he reinforced and recovered his ground then he met general peck the leader of the last reinforcing brigade who put in his last regiment the ninetyeighth pennsylvania but the night was approaching both armies were exhausted and little further aggressive work was done stonewall jackson was in the shenandoah valley and the rest of the confederate troops were east and north of richmond in front general mcclellans army was encamped a hundred thousand strong about the chickahominy river preparing for a regular siege of the confederate capital his army was unassailable from the front and he had a small force at mechanicsville and a much larger force farther back at beaver dam creek a confederate conference was called longstreet suggested that jackson be called down from the valley to the rear of the federal right in order to turn the position behind beaver dam and that the rest of the confederate forces who were to engage in the attack cross the chickahominy and get ready for action general lee then sent general j e b stuart on his famous ride around mcclellan he made a favorable report of the situation upon further conference the 26th was selected as the day for moving upon the federal position at beaver dam there was some spirited fighting between the two armies but the advance of jackson which had been some time delayed made the federals abandon their position at beaver dam they were closely followed and were again encountered at gaines mill where battle followed longstreet came up with reserve forces and was preparing to support hill when he was ordered by general lee to make a demonstration against the federal left he threw in three brigades and for a time the battle raged with great fierceness general jackson could not reach the point of attack and general lee ordered longstreet to throw in all the force he could the position in front of him was very strong an open field led to a difficult ravine beyond powhite creek from there the ground made a steep ascent and was covered with trees slashed timber and hastily made rifletrenches general whiting came up with two brigades of jacksons men longstreets column of attack then was the brigades of r h anderson and pickett and the divisions of law hood and whiting they attacked and defeated the federals on their left and captured many thousand stands of arms fiftytwo pieces of artillery a large quantity of supplies and many prisoners among them general reynolds who afterwards fell at gettysburg on the 29th general lee ascertained that mcclellan was marching towards the james and decided to intercept his forces in the neighborhood of charles city crossroads longstreet was to march to a point below fraysers farm with general a p hill holmes was to take up position below on the new market road jackson was to pursue the federal rear huger to attend to the federal right flank thus the federal rear was to be enveloped and a part of mcclellans army destroyed longstreet found himself in due time in front of general mccall with a division of ten thousand federals near fraysers farm finally artillery firing was heard which was taken for the expected signal for the beginning of battle and longstreets batteries replied as the signal that he was ready while the order was going around to the batteries president davis and general lee with their staff and followers were with longstreet in a little open field near the firing lines but not in sight of the federals the federal batteries opened up spitefully they did not know of the distinguished confederates near by yet a battery had by chance their exact range and distance and poured a terrific fire in their midst the second or third shell killed two or three horses and wounded several men the little party speedily retired to safer quarters longstreet sent colonel micah jenkins to silence the federal battery with his longrange rifles he charged the battery and that brought on a general fight between longstreets division and the troops in front the federal lines were broken and a number of batteries taken at points during the day mccall several times regained his lost position he was finally pushed back at length mccalls division was driven off and fresh troops came to the federal relief ten thousand men of a p hills division held in reserve were now brought into action about dark general mccall while looking up a fragment of his division ran into longstreets arms and was taken prisoner general lee was there at the time longstreet had served with mccall in the old fourth infantry and offered his hand as mccall dismounted the federal general did not regard this as an occasion for renewing old friendships and he was promptly offered an escort of longstreets staff to take him to richmond even as early as 1862 the union army had been using balloons to examine the position of the confederates and even that early the scanty resources of the confederates made the use of balloons a luxury that could not be afforded while gazing enviously upon the handsome balloons of the federals floating serenely at a distance that their guns could not reach a confederate genius suggested that all the silk dresses in the confederacy be got together and made into balloons this was done and soon a great patchwork ship of many and varied hues was ready for use there was no gas except in richmond and so the silkdress balloon had to be inflated there tied to an engine and carried to where it was to be sent up one day it was on a steamer down the james river when the tide went out and left the vessel and balloon on a sandbar the federals gathered it in and with it the last silk dress in the confederacy general longstreet used to say laughingly that this was the meanest trick of the war when general pope came down into virginia as federal commanderinchief with the double purpose of drawing mcclellan away from westover and checking the advance of the new enemy approaching from washington general lee sent stonewall jackson to gordonsville and ordered general longstreet to remain near richmond to engage mcclellan if he should attempt an advance on that city on the 9th of august 1862 jackson encountered the federals near cedar mountain and repulsed them at what is known as the battle of cedar run about five oclock in the afternoon of this fight the federals by a wellexecuted move were pressing the confederates back when the opportune approach of two brigades converted seeming defeat into victory the federals were more numerous than the confederates and jackson deemed it unwise to follow in pursuit so the confederates retired behind the rapidan to await the arrival of general lee with other forces general lee then began preparations for a vigorous campaign against general pope on the 13th of august longstreets corps was ordered to gordonsville and general lee accompanied it there general jacksons troops were near by the rapidan river was to the north farther on at culpeper courthouse was the army of pope and the rappahannock river was beyond them clarks mountain rising several hundred feet above the surrounding hills was a little in advance of longstreets position the federal situation was observed from the summit of this mountain the flags of popes army were in full view above the tops of the trees around culpeper courthouse general lee was very anxious to give battle as soon as possible but operations were in some way delayed until general pope captured a despatch from lee to stewart containing information of the contemplated advance pope then withdrew to a stronger position behind the rappahannock river longstreet approached the rappahannock at kellys ford and jackson approached higher up at beverly ford near the orange and alexandria bridge they found pope in an almost unassailable position with heavy reinforcements summoned to his aid the confederate idea was to force a passage and make the attack before reinforcements could reach pope some sharp marching to this end was done by longstreet and jackson on the 23d longstreet had a spirited artillery combat at beverly ford with a federal force the federals had the superior position the better guns the confederates had more guns and fought with accustomed persistence before night the federals withdrew incidentally they set fire to a number of farmhouses in the locality henry w grady afterwards a distinguished georgian who was a small boy during the war frequently said that one of the worst things about the union forces was the carelessness with which they handled fire pope was meanwhile on the alert and lee found it impracticable to attack him in his stronghold behind the rappahannock lee then decided to change his plan of operations by sending jackson off on a long march to the rear of the federal army while keeping longstreet with thirty thousand men in front to receive any attack that might be made jackson crossed the rappahannock at hinsons hill four miles above waterloo bridge and that night encamped at salem the next day he passed through thoroughfare gap moved on by gainesville and when the sun next set he was in the rear of popes army and between it and washington the sudden appearance of his army gave much terror to the federals in the vicinity when he arrived at bristoe station just before night the federal guard at that point sought safer quarters and two trains of cars coming from towards warrenton were captured jackson sent a force forward seven miles and captured manassas junction he left a force at bristoe station and proceeded himself to the junction during the afternoon the federals attacked the confederates at bristoe station in such force as to make it appear that pope had discovered the situation and was moving upon jackson with his entire army the confederates then hastened away from bristoe station and the federals halted there jacksons forces then moved over to a position north of the turnpike leading from warrenton to alexandria and there awaited results on the evening of the 28th kings division attacked jackson but was repulsed that same evening longstreet arrived at thoroughfare gap during the time of jacksons march he had been engaging popes army at different points along the rappahannock to impress them with the idea that he was attempting to force a passage in front and with the hope of preventing his discovery of jacksons movement pope was not deceived however but turned his army to meet jacksons daring and unexpected move longstreet decided to follow at once to force a passage of the river much swollen by recent rains seemed impossible and so he took the route by which jackson had gone finding that thoroughfare gap was unoccupied he went into bivouac on the west side of the mountain and sent a brigade under anderson to occupy the pass as the confederates approached from one side rickettss division of federals approached from the other and took possession of the east side thoroughfare gap is a rough pass in the bull run mountains in some places not more than a hundred yards wide a swift stream rushes through it and the mountains rise on both sides several hundred feet above on the north the face of the gap is almost perpendicular the south face is less precipitous but is covered with tangled mountain ivy and projecting boulders the position occupied by a small force was unassailable the interposition of rickettss division at this mountain pass showed a disposition to hold longstreet back while overwhelming jackson this necessitated prompt and vigorous measures by longstreet three miles north was hopewell gap and it was necessary to get possession of this in advance of the federals to provide for a flank movement while forcing the way by footpaths over the mountain heights of thoroughfare gap during the night longstreet sent wilcox with three brigades to hopewell gap while he sent hood and his forces by a trail over the mountain at thoroughfare to the great delight of the confederates in the morning it was discovered that ricketts had given up the east side of the gap and was going towards manassas junction longstreets corps then went along unimpeded hearing the artillery combat around gainesville they quickened their steps as the fire became more spirited their movements became more rapid passing through gainesville they filed to the left down the turnpike and soon came in sight of the federal troops held at bay by jackson they were on the left and rear of the federals the artillery was ordered up for action but the advance was discovered and the federals withdrew from attack and retired behind groveton on defensive ground the battalion of washington artillery was thrown forward to a favorable position on jacksons right and longstreets general line was deployed so as to extend it to the right some distance beyond the manassas gap railroad the two great armies were now face to face both in good positions each anxious to find a point for an entering wedge into the stronghold of the adversary what troubled the confederates was the unknown number of federals at manassas junction each side watched the movements of the other until the day was far spent orders were given for a confederate advance under the cover of night until the main position of the enemy could be more carefully examined by the earliest light of the next day it so happened that a similar order was issued at the same time by the federals and the result was a spirited engagement which was a surprise to both sides longstreets corps was however successful so far at least as to capture a piece of artillery and make reconnoissance before midnight the next day longstreet did not deem an attack wise and the confederate forces were ordered back to their original positions then each side was apprehensive that the other was going to get away pope telegraphed to washington that longstreet was in full retreat and he was preparing to follow while longstreet thinking pope was trying to escape was arranging to move to the left across bull run so as to get over on the little river pike and between pope and washington just before nine oclock that day the 30th popes artillery began to play a little and some of his infantry was seen in motion longstreet construed this as a display to cover his movements to the rear later a large division of popes army began an attack on the left along the whole of jacksons line pope evidently supposed that longstreet was gone and intended to crush jackson with a terrific onslaught longstreet was meanwhile looking for a place to get in riding along the front of his line he could plainly see the federals as they rushed in heavy masses against jacksons obstinate ranks it was a splendidly organized attack longstreet received a request from jackson for reinforcements and about the same time an order from general lee to the same effect longstreet quickly ordered out three batteries lieutenant chapmans dixie battery of four guns was the first to report and was placed in position to rake the federal ranks in a moment a heavy fire of shot and shell was poured into the thick columns of the federals and in ten minutes their stubborn masses began to waver for a moment there was chaos then there was order and they reformed to renew the attack meanwhile longstreets other eight pieces had begun deadly work the federal ranks broke again and again only to be reformed with dogged determination a third time the longstreet batteries tore the federals to pieces and as they fell back under this terrible fire longstreets troops leaped forward with the famous rebel yell they pressed onward until at ten oclock at night they had the field pope was across bull run and the victorious confederates lay down to sleep on the battleground while around them thousands of friend and foe slept the last sleep together the next morning the federals were in a strong position at centerville longstreet sent a brigade across bull run under general pryor to occupy a point near centerville general lee ordered jackson to cross bull run near sudleys and turn the position of the federals occupying centerville on the next day september 1 longstreet followed but the federals discovered the move abandoned centerville and started towards washington on that evening a part of the federal force at ox hill encountered jackson and gave him a sharp fight longstreet went to jacksons rescue with the coming darkness it was difficult to distinguish between the scattered ranks of the opposing armies general philip kearny a magnificent federal officer rode hastily up looking for the broken lines of his command at first he did not know that he was in the confederate line and the confederates did not notice that he was a federal he began quietly to inquire about some command and was soon recognized he was called upon to surrender but instead of doing so he wheeled his horse pressed spurs to his sides lay flat on the animals neck and dashed away like the wind a dozen shots rang out and in less time than it takes to tell the story the heroic kearny fell dead he had been in the army all his life the confederate generals who had formerly been in the union army knew him longstreet loved him well general a p hill who was standing by said sorrowfully poor kearny he deserved a better death than this the next day his body was sent over the lines with a flag of truce and a note from general lee referring tenderly to the manner in which he had met his death the federal forces which had been fighting the ox hill battle proved to be the rear guard covering the retreat of the federals into washington general longstreet always thought that the division of the confederate army after they moved into maryland proved their downfall this however is not a part of my story at this time general pope had been relieved and general mcclellan restored to the command of the union army with ninety thousand troops he marched towards antietam to avenge the second manassas general d h hill was at south mountain with five thousand men longstreets first corps was at hagerstown thirteen miles farther on general lee was with him and on the night of the 13th of september 1862 information was received that mcclellan was at the foot of south mountain with his great army it was decided to withdraw the forces of longstreet and hill from their respective positions and unite at sharpsburg which afforded a strong defensive position on the afternoon of the 15th of september the commands of longstreet and hill crossed the antietam creek and took position in front of sharpsburg longstreet on the right and hill on the left they soon found their weak point was on the left at the famous dunkard church hood with two brigades was put to guard that point that night after the fall of harpers ferry general lee ordered stonewall jackson to come to sharpsburg as quickly as possible on the forenoon of the 15th the blue uniforms of the federals appeared among the trees that crowned the heights on the eastern bank of the antietam their numbers increased in proportions distressing to their opponents who were shattered by repeated battles tired by long marches and fed most meagrely on the 16th jackson arrived and took position on longstreets left before night the federals attacked but were driven back hood was ordered to replenish his ammunition during the night and resume his position on longstreets right in the morning general jacksons forces were extended to the left and reached well back towards the potomac where most of the confederate cavalry was general robert toombs was placed as guard on the bridge at longstreets right on the federal side general hooker who had been driven back in the afternoon was reinforced by the corps of sumner and mansfield sykess division was also drawn into position for battle burnside was over against longstreets right threatening the passage of the antietam on the morning of the 17th the federals were in good position and in good condition back of mcclellans line was a high ridge upon which he had a signalstation overlooking every point of the field d r joness brigades of longstreets command deployed on the right of the sharpsburg pike while hoods brigades awaited orders d h hill was on the left towards the hagerstownsharpsburg pike jackson extended out from hills left towards the potomac the battle opened heavily with attacks by hooker mansfield and sumner against longstreets left centre which consisted of jacksons right and d h hills left so persistent were the attacks that longstreet sent hood to support the confederate centre the confederates were forced back somewhat mcclellans forces continued the attacks the line swayed forward and back like a rope exposed to rushing currents a weak point would be driven back and then the confederate fragments would be collected and the lost ground recovered the battle ebbed and flowed with fearful slaughter on both sides the federals came forward with wonderful courage and the confederates heroically held their ground while they were mown down like grass how lees ragged army withstood mcclellans troops no one will ever be able to tell hoods ammunition gave out he retired for a fresh supply the federals continued to come up in great masses at one point under the crest of a hill occupying a position that from four to six brigades should have held there were only the stranded troops of cookes regiment of north carolina infantry who were without a cartridge as longstreet rode along the line of his staff he saw two pieces of washington artillery millers battery but there were not enough men to handle them the gunners had all been killed or woundedand this was the confederate centre longstreet held the horses of his staffofficers put them to man the guns and calmly surveyed the situation he saw that if the federals broke through the line at that point the confederate army would be cut in two and probably destroyed cooke sent him word that his ammunition was entirely out longstreet replied that he must hold his position as long as he had a man left cooke responded that he would show his colors as long as there was left a man alive to hold them up the two guns were rapidly loaded with canister by the staffofficers and they rattled leaden hail into the federals as they came up over the crest of the hill that little battery with superhuman energy had to hold thousands of federals at bay or the whole battle would be lost the confederates sought to make the federals believe that many batteries were before them as they came up they would see the colors of cookes north carolina regiment waving as placidly as if the whole of lees army were back of them while a shower of canister came from the two lonely guns general chilton general lees chief of staff made his way to longstreet and asked where are the troops you are holding your line with longstreet pointed to his two pieces and to cookes regiment and replied there they are but that regiment hasnt a cartridge chilton dumb with astonishment rode back to tell the story to general lee then an enfilade fire from general d h hills line ploughed the ground across the federal front and kept them back meanwhile r h anderson and general hood came to the support of this fearfully pushed confederate centre in a little while another federal assault was made against d h hill and extending far to the confederate left where mclaws and walker were supporting jackson in this fearful combat the lines swung back and forth the federals attacking with invincible motion and the confederates holding their positions with irresistible force meanwhile general lee was over towards the right where burnside was making the attack general toombs assigned as guard at that point had only four hundred weary and footsore soldiers to meet the federal ninth corps which pressed the brave little band slowly back the delay that toombs caused however saved that part of the battle for at the last moment a p hill came in to reinforce him and d h hill discovered a place for a battery and lost no time in opening it thus the confederates drove the federals back and when night settled down the army of lee was still in possession of the field but it was a victory that was not a victory for thousands of confederates were dead on the field and gallant commands had been torn into fragments nearly onefourth of the troops who went into the battle were killed or wounded this day has been well called the bloodiest day of the civil war general longstreet was fond of telling how during the battle he and general lee were riding along his line and d h hills when they started up a hill to make a reconnoissance lee and longstreet dismounted but hill remained on his horse general longstreet said to hill if you insist on riding up there and drawing the fire give us time to get out of the line of the fire when they open up anew while they were all standing there viewing with their glasses the federal movements longstreet noticed a puff of white smoke from a federal cannon he called to hill that shot is for you the gunner was a mile away but the cannonshot took off the front legs of hills horse the horses head was so low and his croup so high that hill was in a very ludicrous position with one foot in the stirrup he made several efforts to get the other leg over the croup but failed lee and longstreet yelled at him to dismount from the other end of the horse and so he got down he had a third horse shot under him before the close of the battle general longstreet said that that shot at hill was the second best shot he ever saw the best was at yorktown where a federal officer came out in front of the confederate line sat down to a little platting table and began to make a map a confederate officer carefully sighted a cannon touched it off and dropped a shell into the lap of the man at the little table a mile or more away after the battle closed parties from both sides by mutual consent went in search of fallen comrades after riding along the lines giving instructions for the night and morning general longstreet rode for general headquarters to make report but was delayed somewhat finding wounded men hidden away under stone walls and in fencecorners not yet looked after and afterwards in assisting a family whose home had been fired by a shell so that all the other officers had arrived made their reports and were lounging about on the sod when general longstreet rode up general lee walked up as he dismounted threw his hands upon his shoulders and hailed him with here is my old warhorse at last when general lee learned that general mcclellan had been succeeded by general burnside he expressed regret at having to part with mcclellan because he said we always understood each other so well i fear they may continue to make these changes till they find some one whom i dont understand the federal army was encamped around warrenton virginia and was divided into three grand divisions under generals sumner hooker and franklin lees army was on the opposite side of the rappahannock river divided into two corps the first commanded by general longstreet and the second by general thomas j stonewall jackson at that time the confederate army extended from culpeper courthouse where the first corps was stationed across the blue ridge down the valley of virginia to winchester where jackson was encamped with the second corps information was received about the 19th of november that sumner with his grand division of more than thirty thousand men was moving towards fredericksburg two of general longstreets divisions were ordered down to meet him after a forced march they arrived on the hills around fredericksburg about three oclock on the afternoon of the 21st november 1862 sumner had already arrived and was encamped on stafford heights overlooking the town from the federal side about the 26th it became evident that fredericksburg would be the scene of a battle and longstreet advised the people who were still in town to leave a previous threat from the federal forces that they might have to shell the town had already forced many to leave distressed women little children aged and helpless men many of them destitute and with nowhere to go trudged away as best they could soon the remainder of longstreets corps came up from culpeper courthouse and it was then known that all the army of the potomac was in motion for the prospective scene of battle when jackson was drawn down from the blue ridge in a short time the army of northern virginia was face to face with the army of the potomac on the confederate side nearest the rappahannock was taylors hill and south of it maryes hill next telegraph hill the highest confederate elevation afterwards known as lees hill because general lee was there during the battle longstreets headquarters in the field were there next was a declination through which deep run creek passed on to the rappahannock and next was hamiltons crossing upon which stonewall jackson massed thirty thousand men upon these hills the confederates prepared to receive burnside whenever he might choose to cross the rappahannock the federals occupied the noted stafford heights beyond the river and here they carefully matured their plans of advance and attack general hunt chief of artillery skilfully posted one hundred and fortyseven guns to cover the bottoms upon which the infantry was to form for the attack and at the same time play upon the confederate batteries franklin and hooker had joined sumner and the federal army were one hundred and sixteen thousand strong the federals had been seen along the banks of the river investigating the best places to cross president lincoln had been down with general halleck who had suggested that a crossing be made at hooppole ferry about twentyeight or thirty miles below fredericksburg the confederates discovered this movement and it was then abandoned there were sixtyfive thousand confederates well located upon the various hills on the other side of the river anderson mclaws ransom hood a p and d h hill longstreet stonewall jackson and the great robert e lee himself were all there on the morning of the 11th of december 1862 an hour or so before daybreak the slumbering confederates were awakened by a cannon thundering on the heights of maryes hill it was recognized as the signal of the washington artillery and it told that the federal troops were preparing to cross the rappahannock and give battle the federals came down to the river and began to build their bridges when barksdale and his heroic mississippians opened fire which forced them to retire the federals then turned their whole artillery force on fredericksburg demolishing the houses with a cyclone of fire the only offence of the little town was that it was situated where the battle raged the little band of mississippians kept up their work and like so many angry hornets stung the whole army of the potomac into frenzy longstreet ordered barksdale to withdraw and the federals then constructed their pontoons without molestation and the next day sumners grand division passed over into fredericksburg general franklins grand division passed over on pontoon bridges lower down and massed on the level bottoms opposite hamiltons crossing in front of stonewall jacksons corps opposite fredericksburg the formation along the river bank was such that the federals were concealed in their approaches and they thereby succeeded in getting over and concealing the grand division of sumner and a part of hookers grand division in fredericksburg and so disposing of franklin in the open plain below as to give out the impression that the great force was there to oppose jackson before daylight of the eventful 13th longstreet rode to the right of his line held by hoods division which was in hearing of the federals who were marching their troops to the attack on jackson longstreet ordered hood in case jacksons line should be broken to wheel around to his right and strike in on the attacking bodies while he ordered pickett with his division to join in the flank movement he told them at the same time that he himself would be attacked near his left centre that he would be personally at that point and that his position was so well defended that he would not need their troops he returned to lees hill soon after sunrise there was a thick fog that morning and the preparations of the federals were concealed thereby the confederates grimly awaited the onslaught about ten oclock the sun burst through the fog and revealed the mighty panorama in the valley below franklins forty thousand men reinforced by two divisions of hookers grand division were in front of jacksons thirty thousand the flags of the federals fluttered gayly their polished arms shone brightly and the beautiful uniforms of the buoyant troops gave a holiday air to the scene a splendid array it was awaiting their approach was jacksons ragged infantry and beyond was stuarts battered cavalry the majority of the federal troops were in fredericksburg almost in reach of the confederate guns there was some lively firing between a part of franklins command and a part of stuarts horse artillery under major john pelham franklin advanced rapidly towards jackson silently jackson awaited his approach until within good range and then opened with a terrific fire which threw the federals into some confusion the federals again massed and advanced and pressed through a gap in jacksons line then they came upon greggs brigade and a severe encounter ensued in which gregg was mortally wounded the concentration of the divisions of taliaferro and early against this attack drove the federals back on the confederate side near the town was a stone wall shoulder high behind this stone wall longstreet had placed general t r r cobbs brigade and a portion of the brigade of general kershawabout two thousand five hundred men in all to reach longstreets weakest point the federals had to pass directly over this wall just before noon longstreet sent orders to all his batteries to open fire as a diversion in favor of jackson this fire began at once to develop work for longstreet the federal troops swarmed out of fredericksburg and came in doublequick towards cobbs wall from the moment of their appearance fearful carnage began the confederate artillery from the front right and left tore through their ranks but the federals pressed forward with almost invincible determination thus they marched upon the stone fence behind which cobbs brigade was quietly waiting when the federals came within its reach they were swept from the field like chaff before the wind a vast number went pellmell into an old railroad cut to escape fire from the right and front a battery on lees hill saw this and turned its fire into the entire length of the cut and wrought frightful destruction though thus repulsed and scattered in its first attempt to drive the confederates from maryes hill the determined federal army quickly formed again and filed out of fredericksburg to another charge again they were forced to retire before the welldirected guns of cobbs brigade and the fire of the artillery on the heights still again they formed and advanced and again they were driven off by this time they had difficulty in walking over the dead bodies of their comrades so persistent were they in their continuing advances that general lee who at the time was with longstreet on lees hill became uneasy and said that he feared the federals would break through his line to this longstreet replied general if you put every man now on the other side of the potomac on that field to approach me over the same line and give me plenty of ammunition i will kill them all before they reach my line look to your right you are in some danger there but not on my line as a precaution general kershaw was ordered with the remainder of his brigade down to the stone wall to carry ammunition to cobb and to reinforce him if necessary kershaw arrived just in time to succeed cobb who was falling from a federal bullet to die in a few minutes from loss of blood a fifth time the federals formed charged and were repulsed and likewise a sixth time when they were again driven back and night came to end the dreadful carnage the federals then withdrew leaving the field literally piled up with the bodies of their dead the confederate musketry alone killed and wounded at least five thousand while the artillery brought the number of those killed and wounded at the foot of maryes hill to over seven thousand during the night a federal strayed beyond his line was taken up by longstreets troops and on his person was found a memorandum of general burnsides arrangements and an order for the renewal of the battle next day upon receiving this information general lee gave immediate orders for a line of riflepits on the top of maryes hill for general ransom who had been held somewhat in reserve and for other guns to be placed on taylors hill the confederates were up before daylight on the morrow anxious to receive general burnside again the federal troops however had left the field it was at first thought that the memorandum was intended as a ruse of war but it was afterwards learned that general burnside expected to resume attack but gave it up when he became fully aware of the fate of his soldiers at the foot of maryes hill this battle marked the only great confederate victory won in the west and was one of the bloodiest battles of the war indeed the contest for the bloodiest day in this great war is i believe between antietam and chickamauga official reports show that on both sides the casualties embrace the enormous proportion of thirtythree per cent of the troops actually engaged on the union side there were over a score of regiments in which the losses in this single fight exceeded 494 per cent the charge of the light brigade at balaklava immortalized by tennyson did not suffer by ten per cent as much as did thirty of the union regiments at chickamauga and a number of confederate regiments suffered even more than their federal opponents longstreets command in less than two hours lost nearly fortyfour per cent of its strength of the troops that received their splendid assaults steedmans and brannans commands lost respectively fortynine and thirtyeight per cent in less than four hours the loss of single regiments showed a much heavier percentage for instance the tenth tennessee regiment lost sixtyeight per cent the fifth georgia 611 the second tennessee 602 the sixteenth alabama 586 a great number of them more than fifty per cent the total confederate losses were about 18000 men the total federal losses about 17000 viewed from the standpoint of both sides chickamauga was the fifth greatest battle of the war being exceeded only by gettysburg spottsylvania the wilderness and chancellorsville but each of these battles were of a much longer time the total confederates engaged in the battle were 59242 the total federals 60867 the battle was fought on the 20th of september 1863 general longstreet smiled and quietly asked him if he did not think he could find one man quieted by the tone of the question he began to look for his men found quite a number of them and quickly joined the fighting forces at the front where he discovered that the confederates had carried the first line that johnsons division was in the breach and pushing on with hindman spreading battle to the enemys limits stuarts division holding bravely on and the brigades of kershaw and humphreys coming along to help restore the battle to good organization about one oclock in the day lunch was ordered spread for a number of the officers general longstreet meanwhile rode with general buckner and the staffs to view the changed conditions of the battle he could see but little of the enemys line and only knew it by the occasional exchange of fire between the skirmishers suddenly the party discovered that they had passed the confederate line and were within the fire of the federal sharpshooters who were concealed behind the trees and under the brush they came back in more than doublequick general longstreet ordered general buckner to establish a twelvegun battery on the right and enfilade the federal works then he rode away to enjoy a sumptuous spread of nassau bacon and georgia sweet potatoes they were not accustomed to potatoes of any kind in virginia and the georgia variety was a peculiar luxury while the lunch was in its first stages a fragment of shell came tearing through the woods passed through a book in the hands of a courier who sat his horse hard by reading and struck down the chief of ordnance colonel t p manning friends sprang forward to look for the wound and give relief manning had just taken an unusually large bite of sweet potato and was about suffocating thereby he was supposed to be gasping for his last breath when general longstreet suggested that he be relieved of the potato and given a chance to breathe this done he soon revived and was ready to be taken to the hospital and in a few days he was again ready for either a federal shell or a georgia potato the vicissitudes of the battle were many and varied but finally the federal forces quit the field and the different wings of the confederate army came together and greeted each other with loud huzzas the army of the tennessee was ready to celebrate its first grand victory in spite of the great losses sustained the twilight dews hung heavy over the trees as if to hush the voice of victory in the presence of death but nevertheless the two lines which neared as they advanced united their shouts in increasing volume not as the cannons violent noise but as one great burst of harmony that seemed almost to lift from their rooted depths the great forest trees before greetings and congratulations upon the success had passed it was night and the mild beams of the quartering moon were more suggestive of venus than of mars as longstreet rested in the white light of the one great triumph of confederate arms in the west about the 1st of november 1863 it was determined at confederate headquarters that longstreet should be ordered into east tennessee against general burnsides army on the 22d of october general grant joined the army and it was known that general sherman was marching to join him on the 20th of october general burnside reported by letter to general grant an army of twentytwo thousand three hundred men with ninetyodd guns but his returns for november gave a force of twentyfive thousand two hundred and ninety and over one hundred guns eight thousand of his men were on service north of knoxville and about cumberland gap to march capture and disperse this formidable force fortified at points longstreet had about fifteen thousand men after deducting camp guards and foraging parties marching and fighting had been his almost daily occupation from the middle of january 1863 when he left fredericksburg to move down to suffolk virginia until the 16th of december when he found bleak winter again breaking upon him away from friends and dependent upon his own efforts for food and clothing for his ragged and hungry confederates it is not in the purview of this paper to more than briefly refer to longstreets work in east tennessee in the bitter winter of 186364 he has said that washingtons men at valley forge did not suffer more than his command on the hard campaigns of that severe winter much of the time halfclad and shoeless the snowcovered ground bore the bloody imprint of their naked feet they were compelled to dig holes in the frozen ground which were thawed out by fires to furnish their usual couch they had nothing to eat but parched corn but the brave fellows never lost heart they undertook to make a joke of their dire straits as general longstreet rode out among them they would call cheerily to know if they might not have a little fodder to eat with their corn it is now generally conceded that no more valorous service was rendered the confederate cause during the four years fighting than longstreets work in east tennessee cut off from supplies improperly supported by his government and sent with an inadequate force to attack burnside in his stronghold mrs grant a few years before her death in discussing the events of those campaigns said to me that general grant had come to nashville to spend christmas with her she had scarcely given him greeting when a hurried message came from knoxvillelongstreet is coming he was much perturbed at having to forego his christmas with his family and return immediately to his works about knoxville in parting she said to him now ulysses you know that you are not going to hurt longstreet grant quickly replied i will if i can get him he is in bad company to get longstreet or to drive him out of tennessee came to be the chief concern of grant and his government general halleck was much concerned about the confederate army in east tennessee the only strategic field then held by southern troops it was inconveniently near kentucky and the ohio river president lincoln and his war secretary added their anxiety to hallecks on account of its politicostrategic bearing general halleck urged his views upon general grant and despatched general foster that it was of first importance to drive longstreet out of tennessee and keep him out general grant ordered drive longstreet to the farthest point east that you can it was easier to issue that order than to execute it and grant reported to the authorities if longstreet is not driven out of the valley entirely and the road destroyed east of abingdon i do not think it unlikely that the last great battle of the war will be fought in east tennessee reports of deserters and citizens show the army of bragg to be too much demoralized and reduced by desertions to do anything this winter i will get everything in order here in a few days and go to nashville and louisville and if there is still a chance of doing anything against longstreet to the scene of operations there i am deeply interested in moving the enemy beyond saltville this winter so as to be able to select my own campaign in the spring instead of having the enemy dictate it to me about the middle of december orders were given the confederate army which was on the west bank of the holston river to cross and march for the railroad only a few miles away the transfer of the army to the east bank of the river was executed by diligent work and the use of such flatboats and other means of crossing as could be collected and constructed they were over by the 20th and before christmas were in camps along the railroad near morristown blankets and clothes were scarce shoes more so but to the hungry confederates the beautiful country in which they found themselves seemed a land of milk and honey the french broad river and the holston are confluent at knoxville the country between and beyond them contains as fine farminglands and has as delightful climate as can be found stock and grain were on all farms wheat and oats had been thoughtfully hidden away by the federals but the fields were full of maize still standing the country around the french broad had hardly been touched by the foragers the confederate wagons immediately on entering the fields were loaded to overflowing pumpkins were on the ground in places like apples under a tree cattle sheep and swine poultry vegetables maple sugar and honey were all abundant for immediate wants of the troops when the federals found that the confederates had moved to the east bank their cavalry followed to that side they were almost as much in want of the beautiful foraging lands as the confederates but there was little left for them with the plenitude of provisions for the time and many things which seemed luxuries the confederates were not altogether happy tattered garments blankets and shoes the latter going many gone opened ways on all sides for piercing winter blasts there were some handlooms in the country from which there was occasionally picked up a piece of cloth and here and there other comforts were received some from kind and some from unwilling hands which nevertheless could spare them for shoes the men were compelled to resort to the raw hides of beef cattle as temporary protection from the frozen ground then soldiers were discovered who could tan the hides of beeves some who could make shoes some who could make shoepegs some who could make shoelasts so it came about through the varied industries of longstreets men that the hides passed rapidly from the beeves to the feet of the soldiers thus the soldiers life was made for a time passably pleasant in the infantry and artillery meanwhile the confederate cavalry were looking at the federals and the federals were looking at them both frequently burning powder between their lines general sturgis had been assigned to the cavalry of the other side to relieve general shackelford and he seemed to think that the dead of winter was the time for cavalry work and the confederate general martins orders were to have the enemy under his eye at all hours both were vigilant active and persevering about december 20 a raid was made by general averill from west virginia upon a supply depot of general sam joness department at salem which was partially successful when general grant under the impression that the stores were for east tennessee wired general foster this will give you great advantage and general foster despatched general parke commanding his troops in the field december 26 longstreet will feel a little timid now and will bear a little pushing general grant made a visit to knoxville about new years and remained until the 7th he found general foster in the condition of the confederatesnot properly supplied with clothing especially in want of shoes so he authorized a wait for clothing then in transit and looked for in a week and that little delay was a great lift for the confederates before leaving general foster general grant ordered him on receipt of clothing to advance and drive longstreet at least beyond bulls gap and red bridge and to prepare for that advance he ordered the ninth and twentythird corps to mossy creek the fourth corps to strawberry plains and the cavalry to dandridge the union armyequippedmarched on the 14th and 15th of january the bitter freeze of two weeks had made the rough angles of mud as firm and sharp as so many freshly quarried rocks and the bare feet of the confederates on this march left bloody marks along the roads general sturgis rode in advance of the army and occupied dandridge by elliotts wolfords and garrards divisions of cavalry and motts brigade of infantry the fourth and twentyninth corps followed the cavalry leaving the ninth corps to guard at strawberry plains general martin gave prompt notice that the march was at dandridge and in full force dandridge is on the right bank of the french broad river about thirty miles from knoxville its topographical features are bold and inviting of military work its other striking characteristic was the interesting character of its citizens the confederatesa unit in heart and spiritwere prepared to do their share towards making an effective battle and the plans were so laid at the time ordered for his advance general foster was suffering from an old wound and general parke became commander of the troops in the field the latter delayed at strawberry plains in arranging that part of his command and general sheridan marching with the advance became commander until superseded by the corps commander general gordon granger the confederate plans were laid before the army was all up their skirmish line was made stronger and relieved the cavalry of their dismounted service a narrow unused road practicable for artillery was found that opened a way for the confederates to reach the enemys rearward line of march sharpshooters were organized and ordered forward by it to be followed by our infantry columns it was thought better to move the infantry alone as the ringing of the iron axles of the guns might give notice of the confederate purpose the artillery to be called as the confederate sharpshooters approached the junction of the roads the head of the turning force encountered a picketguard some of whom escaped without firing general granger decided to retire and was in time to leave the crossroads behind him his rear guard passing the point of intersection before the confederate advance party reached it about midnight the weather moderated before night and after dark a mild gentle rain began to fall when longstreet rode into dandridge in the gray of the morning the ground was thawing and hardly firm enough to bear the weight of his horse when the cavalry came at sunrise the last crust of ice had melted letting the animals down to their fetlocks in heavy limestone soil the mud and want of a bridge to cross the holston made pursuit by the heavy confederate columns useless the cavalry was ordered on and the troops at morristown on the strawberry plains road were ordered to try that route but the latter proved to be too heavy for progress with artillery while general longstreet rode through the streets of dandridge giving directions for such pursuit of the fleeing federals as could be made a lady came out upon the sidewalk and invited him into her parlors when the orders for pursuit were completed he dismounted and with some members of his staff walked in after the compliments of the season were passed the confederates were asked to be seated and the lady told with evident great enjoyment of general granger during the night before she had never heard a person swear about another as general granger did about general longstreet some of the officers proposed to stop and make a battle but general granger swore and said its no use to stop and fight longstreet you cant whip him it dont make any difference whether he has one man or a hundred thousand presently she brought out a flask that general granger had forgotten and presented it to general longstreet it had about two horizontal fingers left in it though not left with compliments it was accepted although the weather had moderated it was very wet and nasty and as general longstreet had taken his coffee at three oclock it was resolved to call it noon and divide the spoils colonel fairfax who knew how to enjoy good things thought the occasion called for a sentiment and offered general grangermay his shadow never grow less the cavalry found the road and its sideways so cut up that the pursuit was reduced to a labored walk the previous hard service and exposure had so reduced the animals that they were not in trim for real effective cavalry service they found some crippled battery forges and a little of other plunder but the enemy passed the holston and broke his bridges behind him and longstreets men returned to their huts and winter homes to seek some of the fruits of his advantage at dandridge the roads being a little firmer general longstreet ordered his leading division under general jenkins on the 21st to proceed to march towards strawberry plains and the richmond authorities were asked to send a pontoon bridge tools of construction and to hurry forward such shoes as they could send on the 24th as the official records show general grant sent word to general halleck of longstreets return towards knoxville that he had ordered general foster to give battle if necessary and that he would send general thomas with additional troops to insure that longstreet would be driven from the state he also directed general thomas to go in person and take command and said i want longstreet routed and pursued beyond the limits of tennessee and he ordered general foster to put his cavalry on a raid from cumberland gap to cut in upon longstreets rear on the 9th majorgeneral j m schofield arrived at knoxville and assumed command of the army of the ohio general grant reported on the 11th how general grant abandoned the move against longstreet while longstreet kept schofield bottled up all through that trying winter in his works about knoxville is old history the confederate government finally abandoned the plan of occupying east tennessee and on the 7th of april longstreet was ordered with the part of his command that had originally served with the army of northern virginia to join general lee on the rapidan i have gone thus far into the east tennessee campaigns for the pleasure it gives me to reproduce the following resolutions passed by the confederate congress during general longstreets arduous work in the winter of 186364 the wilderness is a forest land about fifteen miles square lying between and equidistant from orange courthouse and fredericksburg it is broken occasionally by small farms and abandoned clearings and two roadsthe orange plank road and the turnpike which are cut at right angles by the germania roadin general course nearly parallel open ways through it between fredericksburg and the courthouse the germania ford road joins the brock road the strategic line of the military zone and crosses the turnpike at wilderness tavern and the plank road about two miles south of that point general grant was making his headquarters near the army of the potomac in culpeper county virginia commanded by majorgeneral george g meade the aggregate of the federal command was about one hundred and thirty thousand men the army of northern virginia was on the west side of the rapidan river its total number at the beginning of the campaign was then put by colonel taylor chief of staff at about sixtyfour thousand however the numerical strength of the armies did not decide the merits of the campaign the commanders on both sides had chosen their ground after mature deliberation they knew of each others numbers and resources and made their plans accordingly a number of their respective leaders had known each other personally for more than twenty years they had the undivided support and confidence of their governments and their armies general lee was as always the trusted leader of the confederates general grant by his three years service in the west had become known as an allround soldier seldom if ever surpassed general longstreet who thought most highly of general grant from every standpoint always said that the biggest part of him was his heart in this case general grant had no fixed plan of campaign except to avoid the strong defensive line occupied by general lee and to draw him out to open battle general lees orders were against a general engagement until the federal forces should attack but in the midst of varied manuvrings the battle was begun in half a dozen quarters before either commanding general had expected it hancock advanced before sunrise ready for battle just as longstreets command which had come up from mechanicsville reported to general lee longstreets line was formed along the right and left of the plank road kershaw on the right field on the left hancocks musketry was doing considerable damage to the forces in front and as longstreets lines were forming the men broke files to give free passage for their comrades to the rear the advancing fire was getting brisk but not a shot was fired in return by longstreets troops until the divisions were ready three of fields brigades were formed in the line of the left and three of kershaws on the right the advance of the six brigades was ordered and hancocks lines thinned by their previous fighting and weaker than the fresh men now coming against them were checked and pushed back to their intrenched lines then the fighting became steady and firm finally hancocks line began to break as they retreated and the confederates advanced a fire was started in the dry leaves and began to spread the confederate forces in spite of the fire moved on as the battle waged general wadsworth who was gallantly leading a division of the federal forces fell mortally wounded and there was then a general break in the union line jenkinss brigade was conspicuous among the confederates in pursuit jenkins exclaimed to those around him i am happy i have felt despair of the cause for some months but am relieved and feel assured that we will put the enemy back across the rapidan before night a few minutes later he fell mortally wounded in the general mle longstreet was leading in advance of his troops and in the midst of close firing was shot by his own men this caused the confederate lines to slow up in their advance orders were given general field by longstreet to push on before the enemy could have time to rally but in the midst of the general confusion general lee ordered the broken lines to be reformed and the advantage already gained was not followed up in discussing the war general longstreet always dwelt with peculiar tenderness on the last days that culminated with the surrender at appomattox his mental belief for two years before the surrender was that from the very nature of the situation the union forces would in all probability finally triumph but his brave heart never knew how to give up the fight and the surrender was at last agreed upon while he was still protesting against it the incident is well known of a number of the leading confederate generals who having decided that further resistance was useless went to general lee and suggested surrender upon the best terms that could be had as the wisest thing to do general longstreet declined to join with them general pendleton was spokesman for the party his account of the conference is thus related by general a l long in his memoirs of lee no words of eulogy show up so clearly the characters of lee and likewise of grant as their own direct words and deeds on the evening of april 7 1865 general grant wrote general lee as follows general longstreet was with general lee when he received this note it was handed to general longstreet without a word after reading it general longstreet handed it back saying not yet general lee replied to general grant that same evening while this correspondence was pending both armies under the respective directions of grant and of lee continued their preparations for battle as if there was no thought of cessation the next day april 8 general grant wrote general lee as follows to this general lee replied under the same date many were the wild words of passionate grief spoken by the officers around him said one oh general what would history say of the surrender of the army in the field according to colonel venable general lee replied yes i know they will say hard things of us they will not understand how we are overwhelmed with numbers but that is not the question the question is is it right to surrender this army if it is right then i will take all the responsibility presently general lee called general longstreet to ride forward with him he said that the advance columns stood against a very formidable force which he could not break through while general meade was at longstreets rear ready to call for all the work that the rear guard could do he added that it did not seem possible for him to make further successful resistance general longstreet asked if the sacrifice of his army could benefit the cause in other quarters he thought not then said longstreet the situation speaks for itself several other leading generals were consulted and all of them held the same view meanwhile the federal forces appeared plainly to be preparing for attack the confederates continued work on their lines of defence general longstreet ordered parts of the rear guard forward to support the advance forces and directed general e p alexander to establish them with part of his batteries in the best position for support or rallying line in case the front lines were forced back thus the last line of battle formed in the army of northern virginia was by the invincible first corps twice conqueror of empire in talking over the delicate situation general lee told general longstreet that he feared his refusal to meet general grants proposition might cause him to demand harsh terms general longstreet assured him that he knew general grant well enough to be certain that the best terms possible would be giveneven such terms as he himself would be willing to give a gallant foe under similar circumstances how true this estimate proved all the world now knows james longstreet was born in edgefield district south carolina january 8 1821 son of james and mary ann dent longstreet and a descendant of the longstreets and randolphs of new jersey and the dents and marshalls of maryland and virginia

place with military honors january 6 the funeral of general james longstreet which was held at eleven oclock today at the county courthouse was the most impressive ceremonial ever held in gainesville several thousand people gathered in and around the courthouse and when the guards threw open the doors to the public just preceding the service which occurred in the main courtroom instead of in the rotunda as originally intended there was a great crush though every endeavor was made to handle the vast throng with every possible ease only a few minutes were consumed in filling every available seat and outside there appeared to be absolutely no diminution in the size of the crowd a few moments before twelve oclock the active pallbearers bore the casket up the stairway from the rotunda where it had lain in state from two oclock yesterday and placed it in position just in front of the judges rostrum it was banked in a profusion of exquisite floral offerings many of which came from outoftown confederate camps other organizations and from personal friends across the head and foot were thrown a confederate and a united states flag and standing near was the handsome silk flag of the candler horse guards if any should doubt that the people among whom the general lived did not love him and revere his memory this doubt would have been dispelled today if they had seen the demonstration over his casket as the last sad rites were being said not a business house in town was open everything in the city closing tight their doors from the beginning of the funeral until after the body was placed to rest in alta vista cemetery from every quarter the people came and upon every lip there was praise of the immortal deeds of the great confederate commander as the body was being placed in position bishop keiley father schadewell of albany and father gunn of sacred heart church atlanta emerged from the judges private chambers on the left and were escorted to a position in front of the casket the burial service of the roman catholic church was conducted by the right rev bishop keiley of savannah father schadewell of albany and dr gunn of the sacred heart church of atlanta father schadewell read the liturgical latin service then gave the same in english some of the beautiful prayers are given elsewhere after reading the service and the blessing of the remains the right reverend bishop who himself had served as a soldier from 1860 to 1864 in the confederate army under longstreet spoke as follows had it pleased god that the cause which met defeat at appomattox eight and thirty years ago had been crowned with that success for which both its justice and the singular devotedness of its defenders had given us right and warrant to hope a far different scene had been witnessed here today it might have been that federal as well as state authorities had met to pay a merited tribute to this dead hero who valiantly sustained on many a bloody field the imperishable principles of the right of selfgovernment had it pleased god to spare the precious lives of those of his companions in arms who have passed over the river then we had seen the peerless lee the brave johnston and the dashing hampton sharing our grief and mingling their tears with ours over the remains of the soldier whom lee loved is there een a suggestion of irreverence in the thought which would people this hall with the dauntless spirits of our dead having met defeat in an unequal struggle and having loyally accepted the results of that struggle having devoted our time and scanty means to the upbuilding of our loved land having been blessed by a merciful god beyond our dreams or deserts we lay aside our tasks today for awhile to recall the glories of our past and to tell of the valor of one who fought and bled for us having passed the span which providence ordinarily allots as the term of human life general james longstreet has answered the rollcall of the great god what a brilliant page in history is filled with his grand career born more than eighty years ago in the neighboring state of south carolina he entered west point in his seventeenth year and graduated therefrom in his twentyfirst he served with marked distinction in the mexican war and was more than once complimented for his gallant conduct and merited and received promotion when the southern states withdrew from the union by reason of attacks on their reserved rights which were guaranteed by the constitution and were forced into the war between the states james longstreet offered his services and sword to the cause of selfgovernment no history of the war may be written which does not bear emblazoned on every page the story of his deeds why need i recount them here assuredly no one will question the gross impropriety of discussing incidents of the career of longstreet during the war which have been the subject of criticism by some we who knew him fortyodd years ago we who shared his convictions and in humble ways bore a part in the good cause we know what a tower of strength longstreet was to the noblest knight who has graced tented field since the peerless bayard passed from earthrobert e lee we feel and know today that neither boundless praise nor fullest words of gratitude can exaggerate the worth of james longstreet or pay him what we owe by what i deem is a peculiarly fortunate coincidence we are committing his remains to the tomb on a day when the catholic church commemorates the manifestation of our saviour to the gentiles in the persons of the wise men who led by a star came from their distant homes to bethlehem the bible tells us that they found the child and mary his mother god has sent stars which have been beaconlights on our pathway through the world though in their gleaming we have foolishly failed at times to see the guiding hand of a merciful providence joy and sorrow sickness and even death have been stars which should have led us nearer and nearer to god it is my duty as a priest of god to call your attention to the obvious lesson of this occasionthe vanity of mere earthly greatness and the certainty of death and the necessity of preparation for it james longstreet was a brave soldier a gallant gentleman but better stilla consistent christian after the war between the states he became a member of the catholic church and to his dying day remained faithful to her teaching and loyal to her creed deep down in the heart and breast of every man when touched by the correcting hand of god there is a longing for some means of communicating with loved ones who have been taken from us by death oh that we might reach them or tell them of our love or do something for them in that familiar profession of faith which comes down to us even from the days of the immediate followers of the master there is a clause which brings comfort to the afflicted heart of the sorrowing and answers the longings of the griefstricken it is that solemn profession of our belief in the communion of saints to the catholic heart it tells of a golden chain of intercession longer than the ladder of the patriarch and reaching from the cold dead clods of earth even to the great throne of god a golden chain which links and binds together the children of god here and above a brilliant and mystic tie which binds and unites the blessed ones who now see god in heaven to us who yet labor and wait in this vale of tears it tells us of their interest in our salvation and their prayers in our behalf but it brings yet more solace and comfort to aching hearts when it soothes the grief of those who are in doubt as to the dead who have had their garments soiled with the warfare of this world and have left it not prepared to meet that god before whom scarce the angels are pure for it tells too that even we may aid by our prayers those who are yet in the communion of saints the last words of mother church have been said for james longstreet softly and tenderly they fall on every christian ear for the children of the church they have a deeper meaning may his soul rest in peace amen this concluded the funeral services and the body was borne from the courthouse to the hearse by the active pallbearers the procession then formed in the following order queen city band candler horse guards and governors horse guards honorary escort hearse with pallbearers family and relatives confederate veterans daughters of the confederacy mayor and council and county officers brenau college children of the confederacy citizens and public generally the procession moved up north bradford street to spring street out spring street to grove down grove to west broad thence broad to alta vista cemetery father schadewell accompanied the remains to the cemetery where a short service was held the crowd baring their heads when the following prayer was read almighty and most merciful father who knowest the weakness of our nature bow down thine ear in pity unto thy servants upon whom thou hast laid the heavy burden of sorrow take away out of their hearts the spirit of rebellion and teach them to see thy good and gracious purpose working in all the trials which thou dost send upon them grant that they may not languish in fruitless and unavailing grief nor sorrow as those who have no hope but meekly look up to thee the god of all consolation through christ our lord amen grant o lord that whilst we lament the departure of our brother thy servant out of the life we may bear in mind that we are most certainly to follow him give us grace to make ready for that last hour by a devout and holy life and protect us against a sudden and unprovided death teach us how to watch and pray that when the summons comes we may go forth to meet the bridegroom and enter with him into life everlasting through christ our lord amen eternal rest grant unto him o lord and let perpetual light shine upon him a volley was then fired over the grave of the dead leader by the candler horse guards and a detachment from the governors horse guards under command of colonel a j west and captain w n pillow taps were sounded and the grave closed over one of the greatest warriors the world has ever known slowly the bells of gainesville toll a requiem the last taps have sounded only to be lost again across the winterbrowned fields of georgia but the reveille of awakening still rings out clear and true that today old comrades in arms citizens soldiers admirers friends women of the south children of a rising generation georgia and all dixieland may know that lieutenantgeneral james longstreet the warhorse of the confederacy has at last again joined his old command and the thousands who marched to the little cemetery just as the sun started on its sleeping journey in the west did not come to say a last goodby with uncovered heads they simply said goodnight in the courthouse which but a few months ago was a converted hospital for the care of those maimed by a terrible cyclone the body of general longstreet rests beneath the stars and bars of the confederacy and the stars and stripes of the union old soldiers passed in a neverending procession with uncovered heads for one last look upon the face of their commander look if you will behind that curtain of mist before the eyes of that wearer of a gray uniform and you will see quite another picture it is that of his beloved old pete as he was known by his own command hurrying on to the support of general jackson at manassas or his indomitable courage on the retreat from gettysburg leading on and on as strong in the adversity of defeat as in the success that follows victory or perhaps hurrying towards the front at the wilderness the intrepid leader so far in the van that he was wounded by his own men or at the last succumbing at appomattox to the inevitable and with lee reaping the reward of honor that belonged to a surrender that cost more bravery than all of the battles of that blooddrained period of history the sentinels that guard the bier are withdrawn the body is carried by loving hands to the courtroom above here in the presence of his nearest relatives and friends that taxed not alone the capacity of the building but overflowed into an acre of mourning humanity outside here in the closely crowded hall of justice converted into a sanctuary by lighted candles and the priestly robes of the officiating clergy the services were held there was no music save the stifled sob of brave men whose hearts were awakened to the sacred ties of oldtime memories in a way beyond their control bishop keiley himself an old soldier of general longstreet and rev fathers gunn of atlanta and schadewell of albany officiated after the reading of the prayers of the impressive service of the roman catholic church bishop keiley in a beautiful eulogy revered again the memory of his old friend and commander his address appears in another column but the choking of his voice the closed eyes shutting back the tears that would comethese things are lost in the reproduction of printers ink and can only remain in the memories of those who were so privileged as to be present the picture was most inspiring look if you will at the onetime forest of battleflags hewn down and waterlogged in the blood of many victories to a tiny grove of priceless ribbons that rise and fall with the wavering strength of the old soldiers who carry them and in this same sweetly sad procession march with faltering steps the men who wore the gray and the sturdy step of those who now belonging to a rising generation wear the blue of the reunited union but perhaps even more inspiring than the uniforms of gray were the women of the south daughters of the revolution schoolgirls daughters of the confederacy many of them wives or widows of old comradesthe bravest army of homedefenders valorinspiring soldiers that ever dared not only to die but to let die all that was highest and dearest in one common cause impressive is the marching of men but the marching of womenit is different wonderfully beautifully different what was said may soon be forgotten but what was seen by those who gathered at the grave will live forever in the memory of all those who saw above the opening of the last restingplace of general longstreet the two flags he loved so well were again crossed and stacked for the bivouac that knows no waking just as the near relatives and dearest friends were gathered about the grave there stepped up an old veteran and delivered the stars and bars as the last loving message from general jenkins of north carolina with this old flag and the stars and stripes the general was buried then just as the body was about to be lowered another figure bent with the ravages of time and trembling with the emotion that bespeaks a tender heart and brave courage made his way to the circle about the grave his interruption of the services was beautiful beyond all hope of describing i want he said and he hesitated not as one who has forgotten some carefully prepared speech but rather as one whose heart was getting the better of his attempt at expression i want to bury this jacket my old gray jacket with my general ive got my papers too my enlistment papers theyre all here and theyre all clean i wasnt an officer but i belonged to longstreets command and id rather be a private in the old corps than than well ive served my time and the general hes served his time too and i reckon i wont need my uniform and papers again but id like to leave them with him for always they were enlisted under his command and as i dont ever want to be mustered out again id just like to leave them with him always if you dont mind and as no one minded unless it was in the most beautiful way possible the faded gray jacket and the enlistment papers were lowered with the crossed flags of two republics and many floral offerings as a last loving tribute to general longstreet who with the final sounding of taps again passed for ever and ever to his waiting commander and his old command we think it safe to say that there is something in the suggestion that these late attacks on general longstreets action at the battle of gettysburg have for their inspiration a political bitterness of more than thirty years standing certainly it is true that up to the close of the civil war and indeed for several years afterwards no one ever heard a question raised as to his military ability on the contrary it was everywhere conceded especially by his immediate comrades and associates that he stood almost at the top of the list of confederate warriors not only in the matter of professional equipment but in that of personal integrity and character with the exception of robert e lee longstreet was regarded as the very prince of the fighters strategists and great commanders of that heroic episode if any one had hinted even as late as 1869 that there was the smallest flaw in his fame either as a soldier or a gentleman the author of the intimation would have had enough quarrels on his hands to last him to his dying day along in the later sixties however longstreet was a resident of new orleans he had engaged in business there having as his partner colonel owen another southern soldier of high standing and distinguished service the shadow of reconstruction was then brooding over the south and thoughtful men who had accepted the result of the war in loyal faith consulted together as to the best means of averting its evils which were at that time sufficiently defined finally in 1870 or 1871 the socalled unification movement was launched at its head were numbers of the most prominent and influential men in louisiana and conspicuous among them was beauregard the project was discussed by the newspapers and generally approved in the more substantial and responsible circles at last a meeting was called for the purpose of bringing together the best representatives of both races and arranging if possible a course of action which would make for peace and order and avert the turmoil that afterwards succeeded to the irruption of the carpetbaggers and the consequent rgime of chaos before the appointed day however longstreets coadjutors experienced a change of heart they abandoned the experiment which they themselves had devised and longstreet was left almost without countenance or sympathy with characteristic determination he adhered to the policy his judgment and conscience had originally approved of course it came to nothing and he stung by what he regarded as the desertion of the others and still more deeply hurt by criticisms showered on him often from the ranks of his quondam associates went on as he had begun then began the breach which in time widened to animosity ostracism and lifelong alienation he may have been mistaken at least he was courageous and consistent but we feel sure it cannot be successfully denied that doubts as to his military genius were cradled in that unhappy episode we have no idea of participating in any controversy over the details of gettysburg that may be left to the survivors who were in a position to form intelligent opinions for our part we think of longstreet now as all of his compatriots thought of him up to 1870that he was one of the finest figures on the stage of the civil war a spectacle of perfect gallantry an example of warlike force and splendor we do not believe he ever received an order from lee which he did not execute with instant energy we do not believe he failed in anything either there or elsewhere that became a valorous and brilliant soldier he is dead now and cannot answer his accusers but nearly forty years have elapsed since he sheathed his stainless sword in 1865 and in our calm dispassionate opinion his are as noble ashes as rest beneath the sod of any land now that james longstreet is no more the south should forgive the estrangement that followed long years of service perhaps he was wiser than weperhaps today we are not very far from the position he took a generation ago perhaps his greatness as a soldier was largely due to the same qualities which set his people in opposition to him in civil lifehe had utter confidence in his own judgment and he went straight for what he thought was right regardless of all prudential considerations we have accepted the result of the war in good faithlet us accept all that goes with it in our hearts and minds others advised while longstreet actedonce we hated him because he headed our foes to make us keep order were the riots against which longstreet stood in new orleans to be repeated in atlanta we know gordon or wheeler would head the regulars to restore peace and order if their counsels were disregarded the time makes a difference to the sufferersbut not to the historian through whose glasses we can now afford to look longstreet is deadweave violets and amaranth in his wreath of laurelpeace and honor to his stormdriven soul a camp of united confederate veterans at wilmington at a regular meeting declined to send resolutions of condolence and sympathy to the family of general longstreet on his death and yet general longstreet was a hero of two wars he was the warhorse of the confederacy he was in the thickest of the fight from manassas to appomattox he was familiarly known throughout the army as old pete and was considered the hardest fighter in the confederate service he had the unbounded confidence of his troops and the whole army became imbued with new vigor in the presence of the foe when it became known down the line that old pete was up why then did not the wilmington camp pass those resolutions because general longstreet was a republican for this reason he was hated abused slandered he was charged with disobeying general lees most vital orders at gettysburg causing the loss of the battle and the ultimate destruction of the confederacy general longstreet was a great general he was an able strategist a hard fighter and a faithful soldier so long as lee lived no one charged longstreet with failure to make the fanciful sunrise attack on the second day at gettysburg but when lee had died this calumny was started and it was used in hounding him to the day of his deathon that day certain misguided daughters of the confederacy refusing to send flowers for his bier longstreet was the victim of a foul persecution by a partisan pressthe like of which we see nowadays at everincreasing intervals they did not approve his ideas and they ruined him he advised the south to accept the results of the war his business was taken from him his friends were estranged and his life was made a burden his magnificent services deserved better reward but history will give him his place intolerance even now is departing and as for longstreet himself he stands tonight before the judge of all the world one aspect of general longstreets career from appomattox till his death the other day brings out a very unlovely attribute which was obtrusive in the south during these years that was the ostracism to which he was subject because he joined the republican party and accepted two or three offices from republican presidents this antagonism towards him by a large portion of the old confederate element gradually diminished as a new generation in the south appeared on the scene some of the feeling however remained to the close of his days and evinced itself in the obituaries of many of the southern papers a few facts are sufficient to expose the absurdity of this southern antagonism to confederates who cast their fortunes with the republicans after the confederacy fellthis feeling that an adherent of the lost cause must cling everlastingly to the democratic party through evil and good reports under the penalty of eternal proscription in the score of years from longstreets graduation from west point to his resignation shortly after sumters fall he was in the army and a participant in the wars in mexico and along the frontier in which the army was engaged the probability is that until after appomattox he never cast a ballot in his life moreover at the time of his graduation many of the souths most prominent statesmentyler brownlow toombs legare bell clayton upshur henry t wise botts alexander h stephens and otherswere whigs the whig zachary taylor of louisiana carried more southern states than did his democratic antagonist cass what warrant had the south for proscribing longstreet because he a soldier who never had any politics in the old days joined the republican party just as soon as he became a civilian and got a chance to exercise his privileges as a citizen mosby mahone and many other exconfederates who had been civilians before the war and who presumably had taken some part in politics also joined the republican party though they did not do this quite so promptly as did longstreet when foote of mississippi and orr of south carolina both of whom had been prominent in democratic politics before the war the latter of whom had been speaker of the house in part of buchanans days in the presidency and both of whom had been in the confederate service became republicans soon after the confederacy collapsed their neighbors ought to have grasped the fact that there must have been something in this party which appealed to intelligent publicspirited men of all localities and that membership in it by a south carolinian a georgian or a louisianian did not necessarily and inevitably involve treason either to the souths interests or to its traditions mixed in with the many shining virtues of the people below mason and dixons line there was as shown in their attitude for many years towards longstreet one very unattractive trait as truly as warwick was the last of the barons of the feudal era was longstreet the last of the great confederate commanders he rose to prominence in the early engagements of the warhis was a household name as one of the chief hopes of the cause when those of all the remaining survivors of like rank were colonels and brigadiers at the first manassas williamsburg seven pines seven days fight the second manassas sharpsburg and fredericksburg he was the chief subordinate figure except where he divided the honors with stonewall jackson and after the death of that very napoleon of war until the ultimo suspiro at appomattox longstreet was lees right hand or as our great commander fondly called him my old warhorse how highly he was held at headquarters and the war department was shown in his being made the senior lieutenantgeneral even over jackson after the 1862 test by fire at gettysburg longstreet was in charge of the fighting line of placing the divisions in action on the second and third days of that titanic struggle whatever may be said of the resultof the errors which misinformation and sycophancy have attempted to make him the scapegoat ofthere was no more magnificent display of heroism during the entire war it has not been the southern fashion of late years to praise or even practise justice towards longstreet but now that the stout warrior is dead and gone to eternal judgment all should speak of his virtues his glorious deeds of arms without thought or reference to that sad error of judgment that no smaller in its intent and inception than a mans hand grew to a dark cloud between longstreet and his people this will be appreciated by survivors of the old first corps no good soldier of which has ever failed to repeat with pride i followed longstreet as one of that band the editor of the herald has always left criticism of our old chiefs politics to others if ever the inclination came to us there rose up two pictures of the past that forbadethe heroic and inspiring figure of longstreet as he rode up to colonel humphreys of the twentyfirst mississippi towards the close of that grand centre rush of barksdales brigade that swept sickles and his third corps off of the peachorchard hill at gettysburg to tell him that barksdale was killed and to take command of the brigade and longstreet as he was borne from the front at the wilderness all faint and bloody from what seemed a death wound longstreet is now no more but there is a thrill in the name that carries his surviving followers backward forty yearsrecalling the roar of cannon the charging column the rebel yell the groans of wounded and dying comrades for the death of general longstreet at his gainesville home the other day removes one of the few grand actors of the war drama of the sixties he was known as the old warhorse of the confederacy and perhaps in point of military ability he ranked next to the great lee himself his soldiers had the most remarkable confidence in him and he it was who could inspire them to deeds of valor unparalleled at times since there have been those who have attempted to cast aspersions on his illustrious name saying that he disobeyed lees orders at gettysburg a timely article has just been published and curiously in the same paper that conveyed the sad intelligence of his death from the pen of mrs longstreet presumably composed with the aid of the general in his last feeble days that answers completely and satisfactorily all charges of stubbornness or disobedience at that famous battle it is a pity that so great a soldier and military genius should not have been allowed to have worn the laurels of so many peerless campaigns undisturbed and without envy now that he is dead his memory should be enshrined in the hearts of a grateful people for whose cause he did battle and the remembrance of his illustrious deeds should be handed down to future generations as those of the knights of the round table it is passing strange that any one should make such a charge against general longstreet in view of the fact that general lee never made any such charge and any sane man knows that he would have made the charge had it been true and no doubt general longstreet would have been courtmartialed for such an offence especially as it is charged that this probably lost the battle to the confederates general longstreet was one of the greatest and bravest of the confederate generals and no man should endeavor to dim the lustre of his brilliant military record or cast reflections upon his good name as a citizen or doubt his loyalty to the south no hero that wore the gray deserves more honor and thanks than this gallant southern hero who like lee jackson johnston and a long list of other loyal southern sons resigned a position of prominence in the army of the united states and cast his fortunes with his southern brethren in defense of southern rights homes and firesides and many of whom died for southern honor sleep on noble and illustrious soldier and patriot thy good name and record as a soldier is safe from the attacks of politicians rivals and socalled daughters of the confederacy of savannah it should not be forgotten that when the war began general longstreet like general lee and many others of the souths illustrious leaders was an officer in the army of the united states had he adhered to the union high command awaited him the siren voice of ambition whispered to him of a splendid future of fame and honor and rich reward while he knew more doubtful was the issue if he heeded the call of duty and offered his sword to the south yet he did not hesitate to his mothers cry he responded like the faithful son and hero that he was and proved superior to human vanity or ambition this being true it is but fair to presume that whatever step he took afterwards was inspired by the high sense of duty and that he took it only after having taken counsel with his conscience and with due regard for the requirements of patriotism and honor in every position in civil life many and responsible as they were he bore himself with ability dignity efficiency and with stainless honor there was never a spot upon his official record but the civilian as was the soldier was without reproach if any man or woman doubts or calls in question the record of james longstreet as a soldier let him or her ask the veteran southern soldier who followed him and there are a number in houston what they think of him and with one voice they will say he was lees warhorse when we heard longstreet was in the lead or in command or was coming we knew that victory would follow the fighting we trusted him lee trusted him the army trusted him where beyond these voices there is peace the old hero is at rest little it recks whether men praise or blame him nowthe peace of god which passeth all understanding is upon him and history will write him down as he was a brave able faithful soldier who so loved his native land as to pour out his heroic blood in its defence than this he asks no higher praise a great soldier in the ripeness of years and yet enduring to the latest breath the pangs of the wounds of four decades ago has fallen upon earths final sleep in the brave days of his earlier soldiership and then in the strenuous years of one of the worlds most tragic wars wherein his genius lifted him to the next highest rank of generalship general james longstreet was a conspicuous figure and always a force to be reckoned with the finest and justest military critics of america and europe have pronounced him a commander in whom were combined those abilities of initiative strategy and persistent daring that make the historic general of any age or people while to others who were concerned in the great campaigns and battles of which he was a distinguished factor there may have appeared in his acts some incidents for criticism yet to his immediate officers and men he was ever the ideal soldier and the peerless commander but in the presence of his shrouded frame in the revived memories of his loyalty and his heroism and in the knowledge that the seeming errors of men in pivotal crises are often the misunderstood interferences of the supreme ruler judgments cease and reverence gratitude and honor form the threnody at the tomb the war record of general longstreet will always remain a theme of laudation by the sons of southerners for the reward of it thousands refused to sanction the rebukes his subsequent career sometimes engendered among his compatriots who that witnessed it can forget the embrace given longstreet by expresident davis here in atlanta and the tremendous ovation that greeted the old hero in his veteran gray uniform as he joined in the galaday made in honor of his disfranchised chief general longstreets taking of office under president grant has been always a misunderstood transaction it was not a surrender of his southern sentiments or an act of disloyalty to the southern people at the time when general grant feeling the impulses of former comradeship tendered an office and its emoluments to general longstreet whose fortunes were in sore straits the old soldier refused to consider acceptance of the offer until urged to it by his later fellowsoldiers in new orleans including generals hood beauregard harry hayes ogden and even jefferson davis himself he accepted it in the belief that it was his duty to take any occasion for public service that otherwise would be held in the hands of alien carpetbaggers and haters of the southern people but the occasion was too soonthe passions of the people yet too inflamed without full knowledge of the inwardness of his conduct the people whom he loved heaped upon him a penetrating scorn and livid coals of indignation he was too brave to complain too considerate to expose his advisers and his heroism was never more chivalrous than the long patience with which until now he has endured the misjudgments of his southern fellowmen but these things are naught now to the flown spirit hereafter truth will take hold upon the pen of history and rewrite much that has been miswritten of this great son of the south his stainless integrity his devotion to the cause of his militant people his incomparable bravery in battle his superb generalship on campaign and his later chivalry in the calm conduct of his citizenship and public service remain as wholesome memories of a worldacclaimed southern hero the pestiferous pertinacity with which certain women of the south seize every opportunity to fan the embers of a dying sectional animosity and to blazon their adherence to the principles of the lost cause is again illustrated in the refusal of the savannah daughters of the confederacy to send a wreath to be laid on general longstreets grave next to robert e lee longstreet had the reputation of being the ablest of the officers who fought on the southern side in the great rebellion but at the close of the war satisfied that the lost cause was lost forever and that it was useless to attempt to keep alive a spirit of revengeheartwon too by the splendid generosity of grant in his dealings with the defeated army of leehe accepted the situation accepted too from the republican soldierpresident the office of surveyor of the port of new orleans and addressed all his powers to the work of healing the wounds of war and of reuniting the sections for this he was ostracised by the ultra element of southern irreconcilablesan element made up principally of women and of men who did no fighting and which nurses its bitterness with the unsatisfied spirit of the child who not having finished his cry yesterday inquires today what was i crying about in order that he may indulge in the luxury of tears once more the men who fought under and with longstreet honor his later loyalty to the union as much as they do his steadfast courage and ability under the stars and bars in the bloody sixties the women who refuse his bier a tribute dishonor only themselves with the death of general james longstreet who was the first ranking general of the confederate army passes one of the most gallant spirits of the nineteenth century of all the men who fought with conspicuous valor and prowess for the confederate cause there was none who possessed more leonine courage or inspired in his men a greater degree of enthusiastic affection than this chieftain whom lee dubbed with the title of my old warhorse on the battlefield that remark of lees was like the touch of an accolade upon his shoulders and no subsequent misunderstandings or criticisms have ever been able to rob him of the place among the chivalrous souls of the south to which he was elevated by their irreproachable king arthur general lee and in view of the fact that the most choice and master military spirits of his age esteemed him to possess tactical ability and military judgment equal in degree to his undisputed qualities of persistent bravery such criticisms as there were are scarcely worthy of mention and demand no refutation now in any backward glance at his brilliant career the south can point to his record with pride as his military associates have ever pointed to the man himself with a quick and affectionate appreciation no note of apology should mingle with the praise and grief of those who look today with tearblurred eyes upon the soldiers bier and the memory of his actions on the boisterous stage of battle and of the singlehearted loyal rle he played through all the shifting scenes of that greatest wardrama of the century should in itself constitute a rebuke to those who have sought to rebuke him for certain generally misunderstood actions in his subsequent career he became an officeholder under general grant a very very human thing to do it was a very very natural thing that general grant who had married the cousin of the old warhorse and who was besides actuated by the spirit of a remembered youthful comradeship should give his friend comrade and relative an office when longstreet was walking along thorny financial paths and his acceptance urged as he was to accept by his confederate comrades was under the circumstances very human and very natural he made a good public servantwhere could grant have found a better in those reconstruction days which were not noted for the excellence of their public servants where could longstreet have better served his own people than by taking an office which might otherwise have been given to men who were still so inflamed by partisan prejudice as to hate those people his motives were of the highest in this acceptance and his attitude of silently bearing the remarks of those who criticised him under a misapprehension stamps his moral courage with the golden seal of a serene nobility he was misjudged but he happily lived to see most of those who misjudged him silenced by an exposition of facts which he was too proud to set forth himself the debtor years have rendered back to him the refined coin of a fixed fame for his life labor he is dead and his placea high one in the worlds historyis enduring the savannah daughters of the confederacy whose custom it is to send a laurel wreath for the tomb of deceased confederates refused to send one upon the death of general longstreet a few days ago whatever may be said of the attitude of the south since the war towards general longstreet the fact remains that his espousal of the republican cause in politics did most to invite criticism and this he always felt was unjust to him it seems strange that general john b gordon should have so bitterly attacked general longstreet and it is charity to say that he did it from political reasons and not by way of challenging war records with his fresh grave denied its laurel wreath at the hands of the savannah daughters and his lifeless lips beyond reply to carping critics it is refreshing to see that the loyal wife who walked with him in the evening of life brings her own wreath of the roses of love dewy with her tears and places it upon the grave that holds his valiant dust the author of the article on longstreet which recently appeared in the ledger and which we republish below has been a close student of military history and was personally observant of great movements in virginia during the war the savannah chapter of the daughters of the confederacy has made itself ridiculous by throwing a brick at the dead lion at gainesville it seems a pity that the enterprising news gatherers in the forest city should have given out to the public the silly action of these young women their offence was a resolution refusing to send a wreath to lay upon the grave of general longstreet because he disobeyed orders at gettysburg the causes for the drawn battle at the critical point in the history of the struggle of the 60s will be debated while time lasts so will the causes for the defeat of napoleon at waterloo this debate has been and will be participated in by the great commanders of the world but no reproach has been can or will be cast upon the bravery or devotion of the famous old fighter whose courage knew no abatement in the hundreds of engagements participated in during the trying experiences of three wars alexander and csar and napoleon and grant and lee made their mistakes so did longstreet but how does it seem for a bevy of young women to pounce upon the cold remains of this battlescarred veteran and hero lying in state and attempt to punish him for an alleged mistake made forty years ago in the midst of the roar and clash of the greatest battle in history their mothers knew better we are not surprised that veterans in savannah feel aggrieved as they must feel everywhere that the action is known general gordon believes that longstreet made a mistake at gettysburg but lee said it is all my fault the great chieftain in command made no charge against his great fighting arm touching this controversy colonel mcbride writing to the atlanta constitution says longstreet although a prudent and cautious fighter was not only always ready to fight but he was always anxious and wanted to fight on the second day he was not slow but was simply putting himself in shape to do the bloodiest fight of the war at least twothirds of the casualties in americas greatest battle happened in front of longstreets corps reports show this the records also show that he only obeyed lees orders to the letter grant however that longstreet made a costly mistake there are times other than those at the grave to discuss them there are persons other than young women unborn in those days to administer rebuke or punishment if these young women who sit in judgment at the tomb could not lay a flower on the newmade grave of an old warhorse of the confederacy it seems as if they might have restrained their tongues while the muffled drum passing by rolled its last tattoo at the age of eightythree general longstreet has passed awaya noble character a good soldier one of the hardest fighters of the civil war general longstreet was pretty badly treated by the people whose battles he fought with so great courage and capacity he was no politicianjust a soldier and at the close of the war committed the error of fraternizing with all his countrymen he accepted the situation not wisely but too early with a fine and generous unwisdom he laid away the animosities of the wartime and put himself at once where all stand nowon the broad high ground of american citizenship no part had he in the provincial conceit of the thing that has the immodesty to call itself a southern gentleman it probably never occurred to him that the qualities distinguishing a gentleman from a pirate of the spanish main had so narrow a geographical distribution as the term implies he paid for his breadth of mindbecame a kind of social outlaw and political excommunicant in the land once proud of him briefly his shipmates marooned him well he has escapedhe has beaten the game as sooner or later we all conquer without exertion after a while southern capitals will be adorned with statues of longstreet and upon his grave posterity will see his foemens children loose the rose the death of general james longstreet as was to be expected has revived to some extent the controversies which have raged over certain memorable incidents in his military career for the last twentyfive years persistent efforts have been made to throw on general longstreets shoulders responsibility for lees defeat at gettysburg not a few southern writers have gone so far as to accuse him if not of insubordination at least of culpable inattention to orders given him by the confederate commanderinchief general john b gordon in his recently published reminiscences revived and amplified these charges against longstreet stating explicitlyas his own conclusion and as that of impartial military critics generallythat longstreets blunders had blasted confederate hopes at gettysburg and that general lee died believing he had lost by longstreets disobedience strangely enough general longstreets wife had prepared an elaborate refutation of general gordons theories and had arranged for its publication on january 3the day following general longstreets death we do not think that history will sustain the contentions of general longstreets critics they are interesting enough as postmortem demonstrations of what might have been but they ignore actual conditions they picture a situation which could have existed only as a military afterthought general longstreet cannot be made a scapegoat for all the sins of hesitation or omission chargeable to confederate commanders at gettysburg general gordon is himself disposed to censure general lee for not vigorously attacking the federal forces in their new position on the evening of july 1 he condemns utterly longstreets failure to assault the federal left wing early in the morning of july 2 but he waves aside entirely the exhaustion of a p hills corps at the conclusion of the first days battle and the physical impediments to forming and executing an attack on the federal left wing before noon of july 2 that longstreets assault suffered in effectiveness from the delays of july 2 is greatly to be doubted the fighting done by his corps far excelled in dash and brilliance anything done at gettysburg by ewells corps or a p hills longstreet bore the brunt of both the second and third days struggle and emerged from the conflict with his reputation as a corps commander unimpaired there is no reason to think that he could have fought more brilliantly or more successfully if he had attempted the attack which general gordon philosophizes about in the early morning of the second day general lee at the close of the battle justly and honorably assumed entire responsibility for the confederate defeat lee lost at gettysburg because on the offensive he seemed incapable of rising to the full height of his military talent his generalship in his two brief invasions of northern territory was commonplace in lees own lifetime not a word of criticism was aimed at longstreet it is needless to inquire what influences have conspired to foist on him the blame for the confederate failure at gettysburg another generation of southern writers will do him more impartial justice he will certainly be classed hereafter by openminded critics as one of the ablest and most intelligent of the commanders who fought under the souths flag in the civil war the death of general longstreet removes from the worlds stage of action one who in time of war had his name and his deeds sounded by the trumpet of fame throughout the civilized world he was a conspicuous figure in the eyes of the world and his name was at one time familiar to and honored in every confederate household he was lees rock of gibraltar that never failed to stem the tides of assault and when he led in his turn the attack he was a thunderbolt of war that never failed to strike with terrible effect in council he was calm and calculated well and closely all the chances of conflict in scales well balanced and as a rule with almost unerring exactness he was essentially a soldier whose education training and services for a generation in years made his enforced change to civil life practically the adoption of a new life at total variance to that in which he has always been a conspicuous and a noted figure his was a lovable nature loyal to principle and to truth and when his confidence was secured his trust was sure to follow that trait in his character was the cause of the ban under which he suffered for such a long period from the southern people and as many an old confederate veteran will now say with such injustice at the time the storm of ostracism first burst in fury over his head i was an official of the state of mississippi and resided at jackson the state capital and i was then as i am now familiar with the cause of the outbreak of public sentiment against him let me explain that there had been on the part of the southern people a practical nullification of the federal laws regarding the negro and his rights so recently conferred and it was hard for southern people to swallow the doctrine of equality in anything where the negro was concerned the entire south was in a tempestuous turmoil that threatened the very foundations of society by rising like the stormtossed waves of tempestuous seas and sweeping away the barriers that had been erected against the domination of the southern whites at this juncture prominent and influential leaders of public thought who saw the coming storm at a conference held in new orleans explained the situation to certain popular and influential exconfederate generals then residents of that city and represented to them that an appeal by them to their old soldiers to accept the situation obey the federal laws and maintain peace and order would result in great good and assist in allaying the suppressed indeed often open excitement of the people they were appealed to as patriots to come to the rescue of their people and lead them in peace as they had in war the text of a letter to be written by each was then outlined and at a second conference each submitted his letter the substance of all the letters was identical each with the others they were published in the new orleans papers simultaneously to insure the object in view the influencing of public opinion their publication aroused a storm of reproach and denunciation that was without measure instead of acting like oil on the troubled waters they provoked the fury of the tempest and the authors of the letters were overwhelmed with letters of protest and reproach explanation after explanation by the authors save general longstreet that amounted to public retraction followed longstreet firm as the rock of gibraltar bared his breast to the storm and proudly declared that he had nothing to retract he explained the circumstances under which he had written the letter cited its approval by leaders of public thought and declared that the sentiment of the letter but expressed his honest convictions and he stood by it every old veteran of longstreets corps who reads this will say thats just like old pete he could have saved his popularity had he sacrificed principle but like the noble roman that he was he could in weighing one against the other defiantly proclaim i was among the few who saw nothing then in any of the letters to merit the disapproval of the southern people and looking through the vista of time back to those days i can say in all candor and sincerity that had the seed of longstreets advice fallen in ground ripe for it reconstruction would have been shorn of many of the evils that accompanied it and blighted the land some time after these occurrences general longstreet made a trip through territory in mississippi from which his mercantile firm derived much business one day governor humphreys said to me general longstreet is coming this way if he comes here what would you do instantly i replied i would not wait for him to come but i would insist on his coming and tell him that he would be welcomed at the governors mansion he directed me to write the invitation saying i had made up my mind to so act for nothing could make me turn my back on old pete i served under him too long to do that he accepted the invitation and was the guest of the governor in honoring him the governor set an example that the whole town followed and the period of his stay was almost a constant levee on me was placed the special and agreeable duty of attendance upon him i was with him much of the time and participated in conversations in which the letter that brought to him only woe was discussed never did a bitter word pass his lips in denunciation of those who led him to the slaughter and themselves stepped aside and raised no hand to help him he declared that the letter expressed his true sentiments and that it was written after deliberate thought it proved to be unfortunate and though he was then reaping only thorns from it time would vindicate him and his course he bore his fate like an ancient stoic i count my association with him at this time as among the most pleasant of a checkered life i never saw him again general joseph e johnston of whose staff i was a member told me with his own lips that the plan by which the army of stonewall jackson was withdrawn from the valley and hurled on the flank of mcclellan was first suggested to him by longstreet he said that the idea had occurred to him but at a time when it was not feasible but just previous to the battle of seven pines longstreet submitted a plan that he had matured that met his favor and determined him to adopt it at the battle that almost immediately occurred he was incapacitated by wounds and general lee assumed command shortly after jacksons force was transferred from the valley and hurled on the federal flank we know with what result the plan was communicated to general lee shortly after his accession to command the plan which general lee adopted may have been his own but the idea first originated in the soldierly brain of longstreet again at the second manassas when longstreet to the rescue of jackson debouched through thoroughfare gap a glance at the field showed him jacksons peril and his masterful soldierly ability needed no general in command to direct him as to the placing of his battalions like a thunderbolt of war his command struck the federal army jackson was saved and the victory was won space forbids further prolixity while the theme invites it let me say that no southern man suffered more at the hands of the southern people and deserved it less i uncover my head in honor to his memory and bid him all hail and farewell little cares he now for the plaudits of the world or the censure of his critics when a chapter of the daughters of the confederacy refused a wreath to his remains jeff davis lee stonewall jackson the two johnstons and a host of others gone before were giving him brotherly welcome in the city of the living god and his old corps who have crossed the river joined in shouts of welcome to his knightly soul let us all feel that new york january 4longstreet fought hard enough to suit mehe gave me all i wanted i was perfectly satisfied when the second days fight was over this was general sickless comment today at the city hall with reference to criticism by general john b gordon who seems to think that the defeat of the confederates at gettysburg was due to general longstreet gordon is a gallant gentleman and he was a gallant soldier continued general sickles but he commanded a brigade while longstreet commanded a corps lee told longstreet afterwards that he had done as well as he could he had no criticism to make gordon was in no position to judge the merits of the case longstreet was on my front i led the third corps on the second day the fighting was on hancocks front on the third day he was in the centre i guess every one who was there knew that longstreet fought brilliantly longstreet was practically in command of the confederate fighting on both the second and third days if lee had been dissatisfied on the second day he would not have let longstreet command on the third day as a matter of fact the confederates had no better fighter than longstreet the able editorial in your issue of several days ago touching the savannah incident in which the daughters of the confederacy refused to send flowers to the funeral of general longstreet assigning as the reason that general longstreet refused to obey the order of general lee at gettysburg met a responsive chord in the hearts of many old veterans of the confederate army longstreets war record like that of stonewall jacksons needs no defence history is replete with his grand deeds of chivalry and places his name high in the ranks of the great commanders of the civil war the rank and file who fought under this great and intrepid commander know that he was incapable of such conduct and the only tongue that could convince them otherwise was forever stilled when our peerless lee passed over the river in the first battle of manassas at seven pines when he lead the main attack at gaines mill fraziers farm malvern hill and at second manassas when the illustrious stonewall jackson was being sorely pressed by the entire army of general pope he hurried to jacksons relief and together gained one of the greatest victories of the war he commanded the right wing of our army on the bloody field of sharpsburg and was in the thickest of the fight during the entire battle at the battle of fredericksburg he commanded the left wing of the army where the assault proved most fatal to the enemy in all of these battles and others i do not now recall general longstreet participated winning fresh laurels in each fight at gettysburg during the second and third days of the battle he commanded the right wing of the army and i never saw an officer more conspicuous and daring upon the battlefield one of the most lasting pictures made upon my mind during the war and which still lingers in my memory was in connection with this officer while in line of battle during the terrible cannon duel between the two armies when at a signal our cannons ceased firing i saw general longstreet as he motioned his staff back sitting superbly in his saddle gallop far out in our front in full view and range of more than one hundred of the enemys cannon stop his horse and standing up in his stirrups place his field glasses to his eyes and deliberately and for some time view the enemys line of battle while shells were bursting above and around him so thick that at intervals he was hidden from sight by the smoke from exploding shells his object having been accomplished he turned his horse and slowly galloped back to his line of battle no officer upon the battlefield of gettysburg displayed greater courage than longstreet and his presence upon the battlefield like that of lee and jackson was always worth a thousand men general lee trusted longstreet implicitly and every act of his from the time he assumed command of the army of northern virginia to appomattox courthouse sustains this assertion when president davis requested general lee to send to the relief of general bragg who was hard pressed by sherman he sent his old warhorse and true to his mission longstreet reached chickamauga in time to turn the tide of battle in favor of the south afterwards he was ordered to drive the federal army under general burnside from east tennessee which he ably accomplished driving him behind his entrenchment at knoxville tennessee when general grant attacked general lee at the wildernessthe second battle in magnitude of the warand by overwhelming numbers was driving our army back longstreet by forced marches reached the field in time to snatch from grant a victory almost won here he received a wound which nearly cost him his life and which perhaps saved grants army from being driven into the rappahannock at appomattox courthouse where ceased forever the southern soldiers hope general lee asked his old warhorse if the necessity should arise to lead the remnant of the army out and he was ready to do so and would have done so had not general grant granted honorable terms of surrender would general lee have trusted general longstreet after the battle of gettysburg had he been in the least disloyal to his commands impartial history will ever link the names of lee jackson and longstreet upon the brightest page of the history of the incomparable army of northern virginia one word more about gettysburg i happened to be there but at the time would have liked to have been elsewhere and i decided then and am still of the opinion that the yankees are to blame for our defeat if the conduct of some of our people towards general longstreet the great soldier just dead was not pitiful it would be brutal he the stubborn fighter of all our armies the trusted arm of general lee the idol of the army of northern virginia dead forty years after his many battles and the establishment of his undying fame is refused by some of the daughters and granddaughters of the men who fought and fell under his banners a wreath of flowers for his gravea grave that makes hallowed the land that holds it is refused a resolution of praise by the sons and grandsons of the men who cheered his plume as it waved them to victory why is this a silly story attributed to general lee published after lees death by general gordon upon the authority of fitz lee the story contained the charge that the faithful old warhorse as general lee affectionately dubbed him failed wilfully or from other cause to obey orders at gettysburg can this story be true that depends upon two contingencies neither of which the wildest of general longstreets defamers have dared to formulate first that general lee was lacking in candor or secondly he did not know his best soldiers can either of these propositions be true a thousand times no we all or at least those of us who had the honor of serving in the army of northern virginia recall that in september 1863 it became necessary to detach a portion of that army to send west to relieve bragg then being driven south by rosecrans from chattanooga we also remember that with all of his general officers to select from including gordon and fitz lee general lee selected general longstreet to lead his immortal battalion and the fame of how well he performed that proud duty is still ringing in the ears of all who love honor and glory would general lee have selected general longstreet miscalled by malice and envy the slow the disobeyer of orders the loser of the battle of gettysburg and so of the southern cause if he could have found in all his army one general braver or more competent surely not this fact established and established it is and it also establishes general lees unshaken confidence in his old warhorse what becomes of the improbable story of fitz lee it is a matter of common history that the fighting soldiers of 186165 have been silent since this at least is true of the southern soldiers and pity tis true because our own general r f hoke fighting then silent since could add rich chapters to the history of those titanic days if he would only speak with this conclusive evidence of general lees faith in general longstreet how pitiful is the unearned slander that has made the reputation of so many babblers longstreet a traitor or imbecile out upon it one other equally conclusive refutation of this miserable story is in 1866 general lee it seems determined to write the story of his campaignshis object to disseminate the truth would his example had been contagiousat the close of an affectionate letter to general longstreet uses these wordswords which general longstreet might have claimed as a charter of nobility had he not already had his glorious war record to ennoble him does any sane man or silly woman either believe the noble heart that inspired these words could have asked its tongue to utter the things of general longstreet that have been falsely attributed to it can argument be more cogent or conclusion more conclusive general gordon is i hope with general longstreet both are at rest and i know the old warhorse of the army of northern virginia in the presence of his grand old chief has forgiven his comrade the wrongs done him here peace to the ashes of both the wronged and the wrongdoer general thomas l rosser of virginia who commanded a regiment at gettysburg and who was with the army of northern virginia from the first battle to the surrender bitterly resents the criticism of general longstreets course at gettysburg general rosser was appointed an officer in the spanish war by president mckinley and in recent years has been acting with the republican party reviewing the work of some of the great confederate generals general rosser said to a reporter for the star with the death of general longstreet passes the last of the great soldiers of the army of northern virginia he fought alone the battle of the 18th of july 1861 and won the first victory of that splendid army he shared in the glory of the great battles that army fought longstreet and lee as soldiers were similar in many respects both were great defensive generals but neither can be classed among the successful offensive generals of history take jackson for instance his campaign from kernstown to port republic in the valley of virginia in 1862 was as brilliant as the first italian campaign of the great napoleon he drew mcdowell from fredericksburg he left shields fremont and banks confused as to his whereabouts dashed across the mountains joined lee on the 26th of june striking mcclellan the surprise blow forced him to the james and raised the siege of richmond with the despatch of lightning he wheeled around met pope at cedar mountain stopped his advance upon lees rear and flank held him until lee could arrive with reinforcements passed to his rear and fought the battle of the 28th of september at groveton heights opened the way for lee to press on with his army and crowned the campaign with the successful battle of the second bull run he crossed the potomac with lee was detached sent back captured harpers ferry and joined lee at sharpsburg in time to stop mcclellan and save lees army in may 1863 when lee was hesitating in the wilderness believing that hookers movement below fredericksburg was a serious one with the foresight of genius jackson pronounced it a feint urged lee to allow him to move around hookers right which in audacity boldness and brilliancy seemed to paralyze lee and while on this wonderful march sickles got between him and lee with an army nearly equal his own jackson pressed on turned hookers right as he contemplated dissipated the eleventh corps and all its support and was within a halfmile of his goal the bullock house had he gained possession of which hookers retreat would have been impossible and he would have been at the mercy of the confederate army when he was shot and mortally wounded by his own men lee then in command of an army that knew no defeat and not realizing that his great offensive general had been taken from the army committed the fatal blunder of attempting an invasion of the north at no time during that campaign did he move with celerity manuvre to the surprise of the enemy or do anything of a brilliant character marking him with the genius of war the battle of gettysburg was lost the first day although the confederates claimed a victory and it might have been turned into a victory had lee been a master of the art of aggressive warfare but he followed up the first day with a stubborn attack of the enemy in an intrenched position and failing to dislodge him seemed to hesitate and his plans seemed to be confused finally he committed a great error in attacking a superior enemy in an intrenched position at the strongest point in the history of battles very few generals have ever made an attack of the centre of the enemys position and history gives only one example of where such an attack has been successful that was the battle of wagram where the great napoleon deceived the archduke charles by so threatening his flank as to cause him to weaken his centre when quick as a flash napoleon struck the centre of the enemy with macdonald and his reserves but then the world has only given us one napoleon and the western hemisphere has given us only one jackson when lees army was beaten from the fatal attack which he ordered on the 3d of july he rode among his fleeing soldiers begging them to rally and reform on seminary ridge telling them that it was his fault that they had failed and not their own no criticism was made of longstreet at that time longstreet was retained in the most important corps of lees army and served honorably and faithfully under lee to the end at appomattox longstreet with lee and the army of northern virginia at the close of a most glorious achievement honestly surrendered the southern confederacy was eliminated from the map of the world its flag was forever furled and all soldiers who surrendered there had either to return to the union and become loyal to the flag of their country or remain hypocrites and traitors which they could not do if they had honestly surrendered and accepted the terms that grant had given them longstreet came out of the war with a record for courage devotion to the cause he had espoused and loyalty to the stars and bars second to none disabled by wounds his right arm hanging lifeless and helpless at his side his profession that of a soldier gone he turned his attention to civil pursuits and was struggling for a living when his old friend grant the president of the united states offered him service in the government lee was dead southern politicians had expected longstreet to keep the fires of southern antipathy to the north alive and as they were seeking to inflame the passions of the people as a basis upon which to unite the south and to fuse with the copperhead party in the north as a means for repossessing themselves of a government they had lost by the results of the war this action of longstreet in accepting the offer of grant tended to break their influence with the old soldiers of the south to counteract that they brought up the charge of disloyalty and disobedience to lee at gettysburg never having thought of it before and never in fact having had a foundation for it this in a measure served their purpose because the old soldiers and their sons in the south are always ready to resent anything said or done unfavorable to lee now i am mortified to see that even the ladies have taken this matter up and the daughters of the confederacy at savannah refused to lay a wreath of laurels on the tomb of the great hero i was surprised that fitzhugh lee should have charged longstreet with disobedience for i dont believe that general lee ever made such a charge himself after the war i went to lexington and studied law and saw lee every day and every night our comrades and enemies were often discussed but i never heard him speak of longstreet but in the most affectionate manner colonel venable was professor of mathematics when i moved back to charlottesville eighteen years ago and my relations with him up to his death were close and intimate i never heard him suggest the idea that longstreet disobeyed orders or failed to do his duty at gettysburg or anywhere else general lee relieved general ewell one of his corps commanders at gettysburg from duty with his army he criticised a p hill severely for his failure and mismanagement at bristow station but no man ever heard him say one word against longstreet now that longstreet is laid away to rest all old and true soldiers of the southern confederacy will kneel around his tomb and pray that they may stand at the great reveille with lee jackson and longstreet it is rather significant in the life of general longstreet that under the storm of anathemas which have been hurled upon him both by private tongue and public pen he always observed that silence commensurate with his dignity of character and magnanimity of soul it is furthermore significant that whenever an attack was made upon his official conduct at any time it was only necessary that he point to the official report of the matter as made of it at the time in every case where unfair criticism was indulged in where there was no foundation for such and of course no official data to which recourse could be had the kind offices of some distinguished friend was invariably volunteered it is also rather a singular fact that although he took a prominent part in numberless engagements among which could be mentioned some of the most sanguinary of the 60s he never suffered serious defeat and almost invariably bore off the laurels this statement applies to longstreet more truthfully than to any other general of either side it was characteristic of him and at the same time evincing his great military skill and genius that he very often manipulated his forces as emergencies suggested in the absence of orders from his superior in no instance where this was done does it appear that he ever received a reprimand but the approval rather of the commanding officer after the war his course seems to have met with some disapprobation on the part of some of his admirers south this is a matter which seems rather best decided by an appeal from the arena of individual judgment to the forum of justice and rightold veteran huntsville alabama january 8general samuel h moore a brave exconfederate soldier of this city claims to know inside history concerning the career of general longstreet after the close of the civil war and in a communication written for the public he calls upon general joseph wheeler and colonel w w garth to tell what they know in justice to the departed chieftain general moore writes it is due general lees old warhorse who was familiarly known to the army of northern virginia as old pete longstreet that a statement should be made which will vindicate his actions soon after the surrender and reinstate him in the hearts of those who always felt safe in battle when he was at their head and who would have been proud to shed their last drop of blood to shield his fair name if they had only been cognizant of the facts which impelled him to pursue the course he didas he believed for the benefit of his southern people in 1866 when reconstruction hung over the south like a sword of damocles five lieutenantgenerals of the confederate army held a meeting in new orleans in general hoods room to discuss the situation and publish to the south the easiest way to bear the yoke sad fate had placed upon their necks after discussing all the pros and cons they unanimously decided to accept the situation as it was return to the union like good and loyal citizens and be the recipients of the offices of trust which were being given to carpetbaggers because the government could not find in the southern states men willing to accept the offices that would have gladly been given them in this caucus of generals longstreet was selected to write and publish a letter he did it there was a howl of protest from the illinformed people the men who advised longstreet to do this did not face this opposition avoided this martyr let him bear the odium alone i ask general joseph wheeler to say what he personally knows of this i call upon colonel w w garth to say what he knows and the source of his information let the south beg pardon for the wrong it has done our greater soldier general james longstreet we are here today to pay our tribute to james longstreet the soldier who faithfully and ably served the fighter who fiercely fought the leader who bravely led the sleepless watchful persistent valorous captain of a glorious host whom his great chief implicitly trusted in every hour of supreme and dangerous service and who on many a bloody field hurled his bold and devoted followers like an avalanche on the serried ranks of his countrys foes and who when valor could avail no more bore with him from the field of strife the passionate love of the legions he had led and the unstinted praise and tearful benediction of his great commander who knew him best and had trusted him in many an imminent and deadly breach every man capable by reason of environment character or ability of exerting an influence upon affairs in any important field of human endeavor is called upon at some time to act under such circumstances that his decision must infallibly indicate the character of the man and forever fix his place in the estimation of his contemporaries and of posterity that time came to james longstreet in 1861 he was then an officer in the army of the greatest and most powerful republic on all the earth and had won high and deserved honor in battle beneath its flag high commission in that army awaited him if he but adhered to that flag and the future held in store for him exalted rank which his reputation and ability easily assured him on the other hand was a young nation scarcely emerged from its chrysalis stage and without moral or physical support among the nations of the earth his training and education as a soldier and his knowledge of the power and resources of that great government in whose service he had been so long enlisted enabled him to appreciate and realize the odds in its favor in the rapidly approaching struggle the conditions which confronted him required the exertion of all the virtues of courage honor consistency and fidelity to conviction he was called upon to illustrate the loftiest qualities of human character and immolate self on the shrine of duty or give heed to the siren voice of ambition and lured by the selfish hope of high reward turn his sword against the land of his birth in the hour of her sorest need as daniel virginias great orator has so fitly said of robert e lee since the son of man stood upon the mount and saw all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory thereof stretched before him and turned away from them to the agony and bloody sweat of gethsemane and to the cross of calvary beyond no follower of the meek and lowly saviour can have undergone a more trying ordeal or met it in a higher spirit of heroic sacrifice in that hour of supreme test trial and temptation james longstreet did not hesitate he dallied not with dishonor he was deaf to every call save that of duty obedient to the conviction that his first highest and holiest obligation was to the land of his birth he responded to her call and for four long years feasted glory till pity cried no more his gleaming sword flashed in the forefront of the fighting till when stricken and scarred with many a wound and with honor unstained he bowed to the stern arbitrament of battle when he made his choice and upon bended knee offered his sword as a loving and loyal son to his native south he thereby avouched himself unto all the ages as one who in every hour of trial and in every sphere of duty would keep his robes and his integrity stainless unto heaven he then and there gave to the world perpetual and irrefutable proof that his every act since that day whether as soldier or civilian was prompted by an exalted sense of duty performed in obedience to the convictions of an intelligent and deliberate judgment and approved by a clear conscience and standing on that high vantage ground he courted truth and defied malice no man who rises superior to temptation and offers his life as an offering upon the altar of duty and freely sheds his blood in testimony to the sincerity of his convictions is called upon to explain his conduct in any sphere of life in which it may please god to place him the exercises of this occasion take color and purpose from that tragic era in which james longstreet was so conspicuous and honorable a figure and his record as a soldier is absolutely beyond impeachment did he do his duty as a soldier brave and true did he bear himself as became a man in the hour of battle let history unroll her proud annals and say let williamsburg sharpsburg gettysburg chickamauga and the wilderness make reply ask those who met him and his dauntless legion on many a bloody field and they will tell how often he swept down upon them like an avenging whirlwind ask his boys who for four years followed him with unquestioning devotion and with everincreasing love and admiration and they will with one accord and with voices tremulous with emotion answer that he never lagged failed or faltered hear the testimony of robert e lee his great commander who though dead yet speaketh general longstreet at gaines mill perceived that to render the diversion effectual the feint must be converted into an attack he resolved with characteristic promptness to carry the heights by assault after chickamauga he says my whole heart and soul have been with you and your brave corps in your late battle finish your work my dear general and return to me i want you badly and you cannot get back too soon let joseph e johnston bear witness to the world of his great subordinate at williamsburg i was compelled to be a mere spectator for general longstreets clear head and brave heart left no apology for interference the skill vigor and decision of general longstreet at seven pines was worthy of the highest praise we have yet further testimony which in pathos and convincing power excels all speech or written language it is an historic truth that when the end had come at appomattox and those who had so long shared the hardships of the camp and the peril and the glory of the battlefield were about to separate general longstreet and his staff proceeded to where general lee and his staff had gathered for the last time before their final parting and general lee grasped the hand and spoke a few kindly words to each member of the group until he reached general longstreet when each threw his arms about the other and as they thus stood clasped together both sobbed like children when general lee had recovered his composure turning to a member of the party who is now in this presence he said captain into your care i commend my old warhorse robert e lee standing on the fateful and historic field of appomattox amid the gathering gloom of that awful hour of defeat and disaster with his arms about james longstreet while his majestic frame shook with uncontrollable grief was a scene worthy to have been limned by genius on immortal canvas the tears of robert e lee falling upon the symbol and insignia of longstreets rank converted it then and there into a badge of honor grander than the guerdon of a king it is known to countless thousands that only a few years before he passed away jefferson davis moved out from the midst of a mighty throng which was acclaiming him with every manifestation of earthly honor to greet with open arms general longstreet turning aside for a time from the thousands who pressed about him in a very frenzy of love and enthusiasm he advanced and folded the great soldier to his bosom thus testifying before god and a multitude of witnesses to his faith in the fidelity to conviction and to duty of the old hero davis lee johnston immortal triumvirate of heroes glorious sons of a glorious land fortunate indeed is that man who by such as they is avouched unto posterity when lee and davis laid their hands in blessing and benediction upon james longstreet he was then and there given passport unto immortality the brevity of the time properly allotted me wherein to perform my part in the exercises of this occasion makes impossible any discussion or analysis of the campaigns of general longstreet even if such discussion were necessary which it is not his fame is securely fixed and the faithful historian of the future will assign him to his due and fitting place in the annals of his age the history of that great struggle in which he was so majestic and forceful a figure which does not bear tribute to his fidelity skill and valor will be manifestly and unjustly incomplete and if any page thereof be not lighted with the lines of glory reflected by his heroic deeds it will be because the truth has not been thereon written in the galaxy of the glorious and the great james longstreet will stand through all the ages enshrined with his great companions in arms in the pantheon of the immortals to those who loved and honored him the thought is comforting that after all the battles and trials and hardships of his arduous and eventful life he has found that rest reserved for the faithful in the realm of eternal reunion well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joy of thy lordjudge norman g kittrell houston texas no soldier of longstreets corps during the war whether he was one of the boys in the trenches or wore the stars upon his collar ever doubted either the courage or the capacity or the loyalty of james longstreet no man ever heard an insinuation of that kind no he was entitled to the splendid name the immortal lee gave him of old warhorse and he held in the very highest degree the implicit confidence of the men he commanded and who loved him i love to think of lee and jackson and longstreet and hill as the big four of the army of northern virginia many years have passed since that bloody conflict we are now one people with one common flag and one country and one destiny but we ought not to forget how can we forget the glorious names which became as familiar as household words to us during that trying time among all the other great names that of james longstreet the ranking lieutenantgeneral of the confederate army who earned that title in the field and worthily wore it to the end must shine forever in that noble galaxycaptain john h leathen second regiment virginia infantry stonewall brigade nothing but sickness and a cold drive of twentyfive miles could have prevented me from attending the funeral obsequies of my old friend and great military chieftain and placing my humble tribute of flowers upon his grave and now in the quiet of a sickchamber i undertake to weave a little garland to his memory i know that nothing i may write will add any lustre or greatness to a name that has become immortal in the annals of a people who more than a third of a century ago and for four long years performed deeds of heroic valor that would have shed glory upon the military renown of any country or people that have ever lived or had a place in history i have never permitted any criticism or detraction that has been written or uttered against general longstreet no matter by whom or for what purpose the same may have been written or uttered to have a feathers weight in varying my love and veneration for this almost incomparable commander i watched him in his course from bull run to appomattox and to me he was always a plumed knight without reproach i have seen him on the field of battle and i have seen him at his quiet tent the very first order i heard given to fire was delivered by longstreet at bull run on the 18th day of july 1861 it was the prelude to the great victory on the bloody field of manassas three days after bull run may have been the beginning of battles in northern virginiaintroductory to greater performances but it was nevertheless a finished battle a flag of truce came in and asked for a suspension of hostilities and that the federal dead be buried the union forces had fallen back to centreville three miles detachments from bonhams south carolinians and earlys louisianians were called for to bury the dead longstreets brigade had done the principal fighting and longstreets brigade rested the dead were buried by those who had been fighting them only a few hours before the days battle was over and the sun went down with the victors in possession of the field and its dead the battle of bull run 18th of july 1861 will always remain in my memory a separate picture and like a diamond however small it may be when compared with greater jewels will retain its own halo and its own setting of gems longstreet was the hero of that historic field beauregard was higher in command but longstreet began and ended the fight i hope to be pardoned for this reference to an almost forgotten engagement wherein nearly four thousand south carolinians and an almost equal number of virginians and louisianians received their first baptism of fire i will relate an incident that occurred after the war to illustrate the inward character of general longstreet and how this great man desired to be on friendly terms with every one especially old friends whom the accidents of war had estranged it had come to my knowledge that in some way or other during the war general longstreet and general lafayette mclaws lifelong friends and fellowofficers in the old united states army had become separated in their friendships seventeen years and more had passed and yet no healing balm had been poured upon these two proud hearts general longstreet was a patron of the n g a college he had two sons lee and james at this military institution general mclaws was contemplating sending a son to the school knowing that there was estrangement between these great military heroes i induced governor a h colquitt to place these two men on the board of visitors to the college in the hope that they might meet each other in the quietude of my mountain home and become reconciled they both came and i arranged that they might be my guests with others and in some way i hoped to bring them close together their meeting was quite formal and i thought they were very cold to each other but after the supper was over and getting my other guests to seats on the piazza where they might smoke and talk i gently asked the two to walk into the parlor with me and seated them within easy distance of each other i then began the conversation by alluding to some affair of the war with which they were familiar for both of them had commanded kershaws brigade to which i belonged it was not long before the clouds began to roll away as these old warriors passed from one scene to another and their voices became friendlier i then thought i could be excused and passed from the room and kept others from disturbing them and when they came out together shook hands and bade each other goodnight i thought then that they were friends again that night i called at general longstreets room and knocked but heard no response i pushed the door gently and peered in and discovered that the general was kneeling and praying i went away as softly as i could and the next day general longstreet thanked me for the quiet way in which i had brought them together for said he we are friends again if i ever knew i have long since forgotten the cause of the estrangement it might have occurred at gettysburg it was my pleasure to have witnessed the meeting between general longstreet and president davis so often alluded to as occurring at the unveiling of the ben hill statue in atlanta i had been given by colonel lowndes calhoun on that occasion the command of several hundred onearmed and onelegged confederate veterans when these two great heroes met and embraced my command went wild and they never got into line any more longstreet was almost a giant in stature and always attracted attention and produced enthusiasm whatever his political views were after the war was over he honestly and fearlessly entertained them but he never offensively presented them to any one and it remains yet to be seen whether he was not right in many matters concerning which he was perhaps too harshly judged by some people in 1896 general longstreets name was on the mckinley electoral ticket he came to dahlonega to address the people on the political issues of the day although not a member of his political party i had the honor of introducing him to the people of my native county in the following words as published in the eagle october 29 1896 fellowcountrymen and ladiesa few of the survivors of that gallant band who rushed to arms in defence of the sunny south more than a third of a century ago without regard to past or present affiliation with political parties have with only a few moments notice met to pay an humble tribute to one who with dauntless and conspicuous bravery led the southern cohorts through many bloody battlefields like the plumed knight henry of navarre his sword always flashed fiercest where the fighting was the hottest his was the first voice of command to fire when the army of northern virginia was receiving its baptism of fire at bull run on the 18th of july 1861 and from the following sunday the memorable battle of manassas to appomattox our comrades followed him from gettysburg to chickamauga with unfaltering step they went wherever he led them and from chickamauga to the wilderness they unswervingly obeyed his commands his fame has become the common heritage of us all no longer the sole cynosure of southern hearts and eyes he is the beloved citizen of a restored country and a reunited union his patriotism his history his name are the common property of all the people both north and south he is with us today for only a few hours possibly our eyes may never look into his again nor our hands clasp his on earth nor ever hear that voice once so potent to thousands of his countrymen that voice is feeble but he raises it now only for the purpose of guiding his friends into what he deems to be the paths of peace and prosperity listen to him with patience i now have the honor of introducing to you my fellowcountrymen that distinguished soldier and statesman general james longstreetw p price major j h stine historian of the army of the potomac has this to say of general longstreet it would be unjust in me to keep silent after enjoying general longstreets confidence especially in regard to that great battle in which the blue and the gray met at gettysburg a quarter of a century after that great battle i had longstreet invited here as the guest of the first corps of the army of the potomac he came to washington some two days in advance and was a member of my household during that time we occupied a room together at gettysburg and went over the whole field when he gave me a full description of the confederates movements he was never disloyal to lee but he feared the pickett charge would not be as successful as macdonalds at wagram longstreet attempted to persuade lee not to order it but rather a retreat at night and take up a position on the south bank of pipe creek where meade wanted to fight the battle if we could have chosen a point to meet our plans of operation i do not think we could have found a better one than that upon which they are now concentrating all we have to do is to throw our army around by their left and we shall interpose between the federal army and washington no said general lee the enemy is there and i am going to attack him there lee was a great military student he had before him napoleons great victory at wagram when he ordered macdonald with sixteen thousand men to charge the enemys centre but few of that number were alive when success crowned that daring military movement if picketts charge had been successful it would have crowned the southern confederacy as one of the nations of the world for it would not only have had foreign recognition but valuable assistance upon every field except one lee had been successful and that was a drawn battle he had great confidence in himself and thought that it was impossible to defeat him with his southern legions under his command longstreet differed from him on that charge and i am truly glad for the sake of my country that lee did not listen to him they are both gone forever but it seems strange to me that any military mind cannot recognize the foresight of longstreet at gettysburg the recent death of the gallant old warhorse of the army of northern virginia general james longstreet has again revived some of the slanderous and unfounded reports of his lack of duty unfaithfulness and disobedience of orders at the battle of gettysburg i want to offer some thoughts in regard to this matter and the first thing i want to say is that general longstreet retained the love and confidence of the soldiers of lees army up to the surrender at appomattox on the 9th of april 1865 his soldiers never for one moment questioned his loyalty his courage or his patriotism if these late reports of his default of duty at gettysburg be true is it not passing strange that he retained the love and confidence of general lee until the close of the war if longstreet had disobeyed lees orders at gettysburg thereby causing the battle to fail of success to southern arms does any one pretend to believe that general lee would have continued to place faith and confidence in him his first lieutenant until the close of the war no man who has a proper conception of the character of robert e lee as a soldier and as a great military commander will believe it another remarkable circumstance in connection with these grave charges against general longstreet is that the men composing the army of northern virginia never heard a word of them until long after the death of general lee who could and would have refuted or confirmed them the fame and character of general lee as a great military chieftain does not need that the fame and reputation of another great and gallant soldier of the confederate army shall be besmirched another remarkable fact is these charges came from men that were only brigadiergenerals at the battle of gettysburg brigadiergeneral pendleton it seems first made this charge against general longstreet in a public speech at lexington virginia in 1873 in which he said that general lee told him that he had ordered longstreet to attack at sunrise on the 2d of july longstreet emphatically denied that general lee ever gave him any such orders and colonel w h taylor colonel c s venable colonel charles marshall and general a l long all of general lees staff testified after this charge was made by pendleton that they never heard of any such orders colonel venable replying to general longstreet said i did not know of any order for an attack on the enemy at sunrise on the 2d of july nor can i believe any such order was issued by general lee about sunrise on the 2d i was sent by general lee to general ewell to ask him what he thought of the advantages of an attack on the enemy from his position i do not think that the errand on which i was sent by the commanding general is consistent with the idea of an attack at sunrise by any portion of the army it seems clearly by the testimony of these eminent officers and soldiers who were at that time members of general lees official family and were active participants in that supreme struggle of gettysburg that this charge by general pendleton was only a discharge of hot air i think the general view taken by the best authority upon the history of the fighting at gettysburg on july the 2d which was the second day of these battles that up to 11 am general lee was undecided as to whether he would attack on the right or left no matter in what eloquent words we may clothe our admiration for him as a soldier the soldiers of the army of northern virginia would regard all these eloquent words of praise as inadequate to express the admiration we feel for the brave deeds in war and the unselfish and gallant service rendered the confederate army by this grand old hero general james longstreet general lee told general pickett and the army of northern virginia that the lack of their success at gettysburg was his fault this man of glorious and immortal fame as the greatest military leader of modern times realized that he himself had overrated the ability of his army and underrated the army of his enemy who had the advantage of numbers and of far better position general lee realized then as the world has since that he made a mistake in attacking the union army at gettysburg after general meade had secured and to some extent had fortified an almost impregnable position grant made the same mistake when lee caught him on the fly in the wilderness at spottsylvania and at cold harbor with this difference grant was depending upon his superior numbers and equipment while lee was depending upon the morale and fighting qualities of his army and while the morale and fighting qualities of lees army were never equalled in the history of modern warfare even they could not accomplish the impossible and the traducers of general longstreets fidelity are strangely oblivious of the fact that general longstreet at the battle of the wilderness made a forced march that taxed his soldiers to their utmost capacity to get there in time and when he arrived on the field he found the southern line was being driven back by superior numbers and throwing his troops into line and with his accustomed impetuosity drove the federal line rapidly back and saved the day and gave the southern army the victory at the wilderness in this fight he was severely wounded and the gallant jenkins of south carolina at the same time was killed pendleton said that general lee died believing that but for the disobedience of longstreet at gettysburg that battle would have been a victory for the southern army how did he know that lee died with that belief did general lee ever tell any one so if so whom it is one thing to make an assertion but quite a different thing to prove it i have seen men in my day look pretty cheap in court when called on to prove some things they had said on the streets in conclusion i want to say that while we all regretted and were grieved when general longstreet joined the republican party that fact ought not to have created prejudice sufficient to have caused us to ignore and belittle and cast any reproach upon his character or unjust reflection upon his long and brilliant career as a soldier he was a soldier by profession and according to his own testimony he never cast a ballot in civil life prior to the confederate war he and general grant were warm personal friends they were schoolmates at west point comrades in the mexican and some indian wars general grant clasped his hand and called him jim at the surrender at appomattox grant at appomattox was a democrat and a slaveholder and he went over to the republican party and was elected president of the united states what influence general grant brought to bear upon general longstreet may have been very great for all the outside world knows be that as it may we do know that up to the close of the war he had taken no active part in politics in any party we also have every reason to believe that if general longstreet had espoused the democratic party and become a strong partisan in that party we never would have heard a word of this imaginary default at gettysburg the soldiers of longstreets corps do not believe he disobeyed general lees orders at gettysburg or at any other time we dont believe it now we never did believe it and we never will believe itw h edwards tribute to the memory of general james longstreet adopted by sterling price camp no 31 dallas texas comrade a w nowlin in submitting the report of the committee said in part the following was adopted as camp sterling prices tribute to lieutenantgeneral james longstreet whereas lieutenantgeneral james longstreet recently passed away at his home in gainesville georgia and was buried amid the tears and regrets of thousands of those who loved him and had assembled from every part of this country to pay this last honor to him be it that the comrades of camp sterling price have heard with profound sorrow of the death of this great southern soldier and comrade that educated in the profession of arms he gave many years of his young manhood to the service of his country in the war with mexico and in conflicts and campaigns with the savages of the west and everywhere distinguished himself for courage and ability so as to win promotion and the gratitude and applause of his countrymen that when wrongs and passion disrupted the nation and his native state withdrew from the union and united with the confederate states of america he felt that his allegiance no longer belonged to the other states of the union but to the one of which he was a citizen and he resigned his office in the united states army and offered his services to the government of the confederacy he received the rank of brigadiergeneral and being always in the front when campaigns were most important and the enemy the most powerful and battles were furious he was promoted for distinguished bravery conduct and generalship to be majorgeneral lieutenantgeneral and second in command of the great army of northern virginia under the great commander lee as brigadiergeneral at manassas he held the left wing of the enemy by his boldness so that it could not give assistance to the defeated right wing as majorgeneral he covered general johnstons retreat in the peninsula before the advance of mcclellan and fought the victorious battle of williamsburg as majorgeneral he commanded the right wing in the bloody battle of seven pines and with d h hill drove the enemy from the field in the seven days battle around richmond no general gained greater renown and soon thereafter when congress directed the president to appoint seven corps commanders with the rank of lieutenantgeneral majorgeneral longstreet was made the ranking lieutenantgeneral and second in command of the army under lee which position he held through the great battles and campaigns of that army for three years until with lee and the remnant of his heroes he surrendered at appomattox at the second battle of manassas he commanded the right wing of the army and with jackson on the left drove pope into the fortification of washington at south mountain he held mcclellan with a death grip until jackson could storm harpers ferry and commanded the right wing at sharpsburg and fought more than double his number under mcclellan from early dawn until darkness spread her sombre shadows over the bloodiest scene in american history it was here that lee knighted him as his warhorse as the last guns were sending their hoarse echoes among the mountains next at fredericksburg he commanded the left wing and at nightfall on the 13th of december 1862 eight thousand of the enemy were stretched out dead or bleeding in front of his corps at gettysburg riding by the side of lee without expecting nor desiring at that time to join battle with the enemy they heard the thunder of hills and ewells guns and hastened to their assistance the first days battle was fought and won before lee or longstreet could take an active part on the second day longstreet commanded the right wing and fought one of the bloodiest battles of the war driving almost the entire army of meade before him and leaving more than ten thousand of the enemy slain or wounded on the field the third day of this great battle he exhibited the loftiest courage next he and his corps were sent from virginia to georgia and joined bragg in the terrible battle of chickamauga where he commanded the left wing and routed the right wing of rosecranss army when grant and meade with their forty thousand veteran soldiers were advancing upon lee in the wilderness of virginia the great commander of the army of northern virginia called longstreet with his men back from tennessee and with panting breath and quick step and double ranks he headed the texas brigade and rushed upon the cheering and triumphant enemy on the second day in the wilderness and drove them over their works amid the blazing woods and a great victory was in the grasp of lee when a bullet from our own men by mistake crashed through his body and he was carried from the field desperately wounded the guiding hand of the great general and fighter was gone and victory fled as the fatal opportunity was lost in the long siege and through the many battles around richmond and petersburg lasting nearly twelve months longstreet commanded the left wing on the north side of the james and stood like an immovable mountain between the enemy and the confederate capital when the sad day of five forks came and lees lines were broken about petersburg longstreet was called from richmond with his men to the assistance of his great commander and covered the retreat and gave blow for blow to the charging enemy and when the sun rose on the day of the 9th of april and grant was about to offer terms for the surrender of the southern army longstreet told general lee that if the terms were not honorable they would fight again and die fighting thus he fought and stood by his chief to the bitter end retaining the confidence of his commander and his president to the last and if they who knew him best and trusted him most and were with him day and night and knew his thoughts and opinions and witnessed his deeds and actions throughout all the vicissitudes and trials of those days that measured the souls of menif they believed in him trusted him leaned on him and kept him second to lee who shall have the temerity to criticise to condemn and to throw stones at this imperial soldier those of us who have heard the thunder of his guns those of us who have seen him leading his warriors in battle those of us who have seen him stand like a gibraltar against the charging thousands of a fierce foe will honor him as a great soldier who has added to the fame of southern manhood and who is worthy to stand through the ages with lee and johnston and jackson and stewart and all the brave men who laid their bare breasts to the storm of war in the name of freedom and independence we honor ourselves by honoring such a man that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of this camp and a copy be sent to mrs james longstreet by the adjutant the following resolution in memory of lieutenantgeneral james longstreet

opening of the campaign of 1862 his stubborn gallantry saved the army of northern virginia for its long career of glory how later in the same campaign his superb strategy rescued stonewall jackson from the swarming thousands about to overwhelm him how in 1863 he flew to the aid of the heroic army of tennessee and with it won the resplendent victory of chickamauga in short we know him by the proud title of the warhorse of the confederacy a title worthily bestowed by general robert e lee himself he was a grand soldier a solomon in council and a samson in the field that these resolutions be inscribed on a special page of our minutes and that a copy thereof be transmitted by our adjutant to the family of the valiant dead verily though dead yet in history he will continue to live be it therefore that while we the daughters of the confederacy deplore the loss of our beloved confederate general james longstreet who was the first ranking general of the confederate army passes one of the most gallant spirits of the nineteenth century in the war drama of his life he played a most important part at the beginning of the scene of the civil war he took up the southlands cause and began as brigadiergeneral a career of courageous fighting which won for him the admiration of the world he was a comrade of jackson and a companion of lee in personal appearance general longstreet was well adapted to play this important part so distinguished in appearance he was indeed a veritable warhorse his career in the confederate army was a magnificent display of this loyal adherence to his views of truth and right his fame as a soldier is imperishably inscribed on the scroll of history worn by recurring paroxysms of exquisite pain the great warrior was weary as the evening shadows fell and patiently asked his devoted wife to rearrange his couch i shall rest better on the other side he said gently then the spirit took its flight perish the hand and strike down the pen that would rob him of a peoples gratitude to a brave and loyal son his death caused universal sorrow among those who honor the chivalry gallantry and bravery which lent to the confederate cause the lustre that can never dim and left a laurelled history that will never die for he who best knows how to endure shall possess the greater peace that we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his bereaved family in this hour of unspeakable sorrow and pray that the hand of our heavenly father may be laid in gracious healing upon their broken hearts that the holy one may abide with them in comforting influence and that the sunshine of his wonderful presence may brighten the present sad separation by the sure promise of reunion with their beloved in the land where suffering and death are unknown that a copy of these resolutions be sent to the city papers and to the bereaved family and that they be inscribed in our minutes we have assembled here to pay tribute to the memory of the warhorse of the army of northern

of manassas and fought his way up to lieutenantgeneral being the ranking lieutenantgeneral in lees grand army he served with conspicuous gallantry in nearly all the battles in which that army was engagedmanassas williamsburg seven pines under johnston the seven days battles around richmond cedar mountain second manassas sharpsburg it was here that general lee knighted him as his warhorse fredericksburg gettysburg chickamauga the wilderness around richmond and petersburg and in almost all the great battles in which lees army was engaged however we may have differed with him in the political path which he chose when the army which he led with such conspicuous ability laid down their arms and returned to peaceful pursuits we recognize in him a great general and the battlefields of virginia will ever attest and pay tribute to his military genius history will hand down his name to posterity as one of the great generals of the south one who was true and faithful to the starspangled banner under which he fought and in whom our great commander general r e lee placed his confidence and trust general longstreet possessed the esteem and confidence of his troops in a marked degree in camp and field and in advance or retreat his deeds of daring are coupled with that of the army of general lee and are as lasting as the hills of virginia we extend our sympathy to the family of this grand old general who has passed over the river to the memory of general longstreet passed by camp james longstreet u c v at their regular meeting in ennis texas january 17 1904 whereas the commanderinchief has been pleased to call the late lieutenantgeneral james longstreet across the river to rest in the shade on the other shore with his former commanding general r e lee and his associates hood jackson and others who had preceded him and whereas in the removal of this great soldier from the walks of life to his future reward the military world has lost one of the most distinguished military characters known to the history of civil warfare america has lost a loyal patriot whose inflexible devotion to duty as he saw it from a viewpoint of patriotic loyalty to his country commanded the admiration of the age in which he lived the south has lost a son whose distinguished services as a gallant soldier and whose superior ability as a general in the army of northern virginia easily classed him with the greatest of the worlds great generals one whose brilliant record sheds an honorable lustre on the southern soldier of which the american people feel justly proud therefore be it that while we deplore with sadness the death of general longstreet who enjoyed the full confidence of his commanding general and of the officers and men of his command as a gallant and prudent officer we cherish his record as a general in the army of virginia as a spotless sheen of soldierly merit and worth faultless in every respect that a page in the recordbook of camp james longstreet be set apart and that these resolutions in memory of our departed general be recorded thereon longstreet was the chosen leader and central figure in every great conflict from the first battle of manassas to the fateful day at appomattox sparta never had a worthier son than the south had in general longstreet from the firing of the first gun his ardor never ceased his courage never failed often in the midst of the greatest battle did he stand with his men when they fell around him like forests in a storm his presence was inspiring and his word talismanic no soldier was ever more loved or confided in than he who shall say that his name shall not emblazon the brightest page of our history who will deny him that great praise so justly his own by reason of his great services and terrible suffering history will be incomplete without according him her brightest page and as long as we live to recount deeds of valor and heroism on the battlefield will live the names of lee longstreet and stonewall jackson who that was at gettysburg spottsylvania and the wilderness when the earth rocked with the tramp of armed men and the roar of battle resounded almost to heaven would deny him this mead of praise in all these was general longstreet a prime warrior a conspicuous actor he rarely if ever was defeated he planned his marches battles and retreats with a strategy little less than transcendent and when he made a stand he placed his back to the rock and bid defiance to his enemies he was to lee what ney was to napoleon a guide a friend and a confidant i cannot pass this occasion without recalling an incident at the wilderness on the 5th day of may 1864 general grant had devastated the entire country from the rapidan river to fredericksburg his soldiers were as numerous as the assyrian hosts hancocks corps had advanced to the west side of the plank road that ran through that dismal swamp and had driven both pendor and heath out of their breastworks thus breaking through the centre of our line of battle it was an awful hourfear and despair could be seen in every face in vain did heath and pendor try to repossess their works just at that moment longstreet arrived on the ground hoods texans were in front lee came in a gallop to meet them with tears in his eyes and his long hair flying in the wind he asked what troops are these hoods texans was the reply follow me he said when he started to lead them a texan belonging to the first texas regiment commanded by colonel j r harding now of jackson mississippi caught the bridle of general lees horse and turned him back away went the texans followed by the mississippi arkansas alabama and louisiana brigades and drove the enemy back and saved the day this was but one of the glorious acts of general longstreet cold harbor seven pines gaines mill sharpsburg fredericksburg are not less glorious than others named and all made so by the energy and courage of longstreet and his faithful soldiers at the battle of sharpsburg for a long time our army was threatened with defeat our lines began to waver before the terrible fire of the superior numbers with which we were contending when general longstreet just from a hot contest on our left was brought around to the centre and for six long hours he repelled the assailants of this numerous host and kept the executives at bay and drove back the mamalukes of power forget him no the names of lee and longstreet will live as those of csar and napoleon and when this physical world shall have perished and the heavens rolled together as a scroll the names of these men will be remembered that in the death of general longstreet the south has lost one of her most brilliant soldiers that in battles his name was a synonym of success and his presence an inspiration to his men a terror to his enemies that the camp wear the usual badge for thirty days and a copy of this paper be sent to his family at gainesville georgia comradesat his home at gainesville georgia at 5 pm saturday january 2 1904 in his eightythird year lieutenantgeneral longstreet answered his last rollcall if alabama had done nothing save to give us longstreet and pelham she would have done much for herself the southland and for fame if with alexander hannibal and napoleon robert e lee takes first rank among the worlds great generals surely general longstreet may stand with those who occupy second rank among the worlds great military men if jackson was lees right hand longstreet was his left from manassas to appomattox longstreet was a very thunderbolt of war when jackson at the second battle of manassas was hard pressed by popes whole army longstreet rushed to his aid and striking popes flank crushed it as an eggshell in the hand of a strong man thus always and everywhere that longstreet led his men hurried to death as joyously as the bridegroom to greet the bride where his flag waved his lines stood as immovable as gibraltar to the storms of the ocean and when he moved forward there the enemy were beaten or death and carnage reigned supreme if after appomattox longstreet made mistakes or we imagined he did the mantle of death covers them all remembering there has only one lived without fault they are forgotten and standing by his grave we remember only his virtues and the heroism and skill which made him great in times and places where great men were thick as fallen leaves in vallombrosa therefore be it that we mourn the death of our great leader and tender to his bereaved family our sincere sympathy that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of this camp and that copies be furnished our town papers for publication and a copy be sent to general longstreets widow commander john purifoy spoke of the death of general longstreet and introduced the subjoined resolutions which were unanimously adopted in the death of lieutenantgeneral james longstreet a great soldier has passed over the river to his final rest no more will he wake to behold the splendor and fame of his men he has fought his last battle in the school of war he had learned courage promptness and determination its stern lessons had taught him fortitude in suffering coolness in danger and cheerfulness under reverses every southerner should feel proud of his record as a soldier while some of those who were associated with him in the many great battles in which he was a conspicuous figure have permitted themselves to engage in some adverse criticism of his conduct on one occasion only the officers and men under his immediate command never for a moment doubted his courage his skill his integrity his sincerity or his loyalty to the cause for which he unsheathed his sword nor did the great lee whose confidence he retained to his death ever intimate that longstreet was not faithful brave and prompt in the discharge of every duty as a soldier as surviving comrades we will cherish his memory as alabamans we are proud of his record his integrity his honesty and his heroic conduct are worthy of emulation that our sincere condolence is hereby tendered his bereaved widow and other members of his family that this memorial and resolutions be spread upon our minutes and that they be given to the press for publication that a copy of the same be mailed to his widow at gainesville georgia whereas we the members of the george b eastin camp of united confederate veterans louisville kentucky have heard with profound regret of the death of our distinguished comrade lieutenantgeneral james longstreet and feel that we should pay tribute to the memory of one who was so conspicuously associated with the cause for which we fought therefore be it that we recognize and testify to the valor and devotion which he exhibited on so many fields made memorable by confederate effort and caused him to be worthily ranked among the best and bravest soldiers of the army of northern virginia with the history and the glory of that army his name will ever be signally and inseparably connected his fame as a skilful resolute and sagacious commander the honor due him as a dauntless defender of his native soil his record for faithful performance of duty and unflinching courage from manassas to appomattox will endure so long as the story of the great struggle shall be told forgetting in the presence of his death and grave all later

requested to publish same also that a copy be sent to the bereaved widow of our distinguished comrade two weeks ago today the wires flashed the news over the country that general james longstreet the

years of age he graduated from west point in 1842 was in the war with mexico and brevetted for meritorious service at churubusco and molino del rey he was wounded september 8 1847 at the storming of chapultepec he was commissioned brigadiergeneral in the confederate army at the first battle of bull run in 1861 where he commanded a brigade on the right of the confederate army and held in check a strong force of the enemy in a vain effort to turn general johnstons flank and from then until the dark day at appomattox when the sun of the confederacy went down in gloom to rise no more the flag of old pete as he was familiarly called by his old comrades was everywhere in the thick of the fight and he was one of lees most trusted lieutenants and every true confederate soldier will drop a tear to his memory he has crossed the dark river and is now resting with lee jackson and thousands of others who have answered the last rollcall heard the last tattoo and will hear the roll of the drum and

military chieftains the united states one of her most illustrious citizens and the south one who in the darkest hours of peril boasted him among her noblest and best his sword was one of the most trenchant ever drawn in her defence and to her is left the proud heritage of his brilliant career that as this sad news is flashed around the world it is fitting that every exconfederate soldier should bow his head in deep sadness as his bier passes us to the silent city of the dead that as our great comrade has obeyed his last tattoo and after a long and useful life has gone to peaceful rest where wars dread alarm is heard no longer that we pray the reveille of resurrection morning will wake him to receive a crown of glory brighter far than heroes ever won in the battlefield that we his

james longstreet respectfully report as follows lieutenantgeneral longstreet was the commander of the first corps of the army of northern virginia and the last survivor of the great warriors upon whom that rank was first conferred when the confederate armies were organized into corps he was known as the fighting general and with the exception of the battle of chancellorsville was with general lee in all his campaigns from the seven days fight around richmond until the war ended at appomattox save only when incapacitated a few months by wounds received in the battle of the wilderness in 1864 he was loved and respected by his soldiers and the surviving veterans of his corps have always honored their leader and are mourners at his grave that we who knew him and followed him through the dangers and trials of protracted war claim the privilege of paying our tribute of heartfelt sorrow to the memory of our dead commander that we extend to his widow and surviving children our sympathy in their affliction that this memorial be spread upon the records of this camp and that a copy be sent to his bereaved family in the death of general james longstreet passes away one of the most prominent generals of the southern confederacy he was born in edgefield district south carolina january 8 1821 when ten years old in 1831 he moved with his mother to alabama and from this state he was appointed to the united states military academy from whence he graduated in 1842 he was assigned to duty at jefferson barracks missouri in 184244 on frontier duty at natchitoches louisiana 184445 in the occupation of texas 184546 and in the war with mexico here he was wounded was promoted several times for gallantry his courage being observable on all occasions he faithfully discharged his duties as an officer of the united states until june 1 1861 when he resigned and entered the service of the southern confederacy his career is well known to his comrades and is a part of the glorious history of our southern cause he was a brave soldier a superior officer brave and true and one of the hardest fighters of the army of northern virginia general lee had implicit confidence in him and leaned on him as a strong arm of defence in the most desperate fighting and splendid generalship longstreet was a man of the front where he stood to execute orders the most difficult and hazardous and did not lay aside his sword until his leader surrendered his shattered forces until there was no more fighting to do he was cool deliberate and yet generous it became an acknowledged fact that where longstreet and his brave men were was sure and desperate fighting he stood in line of battle ready for engagement when the surrender came loosening his grip on his faithful sword only when the war had ended we honor him for his works sake and bow our heads in memory of his wonderful achievements his devotedness to duty and love for our great southland that this memorial be spread upon the minutes of this camp a copy furnished the family of our deceased comrade and a copy furnished such papers as may wish to publish the same done by order of j e b stuart camp no 45 u c v terrell texas january 16 ad 1904 first that in general longstreets death we have lost one of the bravest generals who fought on either side of the civil warone whom the great lee called the right arm of the army of northern virginia he was one of the most persistent and determined fighters that any country ever produced second he was independent selfreliant watchful devoted to the cause he espoused he never flinched from unexpected difficulties and showed his readiness to die at his post if need be he was a man of superb courage he not only acted without fear but he had that fortitude of soul that bears the consequence of the course pursued without complaint in the presence of death the good man judges as he would be judged in the grave should be buried every prejudice and passion born in conflict of opinion fortunate are we indeed when we become great enough to know and appreciate the great longstreet was brave enough to follow the path of duty as he saw it no matter where it led in speaking words of love and praise over his grave we honor ourselves may we with gratitude remember the good that he has done may he rest in peace that a copy of these resolutions be sent the family of the deceased and that they be spread upon the record of the camp the foregoing resolutions were adopted by a rising vote of the camp january 14 1904 whereas it has come to our knowledge that our esteemed honorary member lieutenantgeneral james longstreet late of the confederate army has passed to that bourne from which no traveller has ever returned and whereas we had reason to respect him as a foe with whom we were often in conflict and to whom we sometimes had to yield the palm of victory and especially do we remember the gallant fight he and his tried veterans made at fort saunders knoxville east tennessee on november 29 1863 when we were victorious only after he had thrice been repulsed and whereas we also remember with pleasure the reunion of the blue and the gray held at knoxville in 1890 where we again renewed our acquaintance with the general and his gallant band but under far different and pleasanter circumstancesthey were our foes in 1863 our friends in 1890 and we also recall the many hours we passed in his company when we fought our battles over and over again and where we had the pleasure of placing upon our roll the name of general longstreet as an honorary member therefore be it that in his death we feel that there has passed away a gallant soldier and gentleman who in the conflict and struggle of the civil war where so many gave their lives to defend the cause which each espoused we learned to respect and in peace we learned to love and we therefore extend to his widow and family in their bereavement our heartfelt sympathy committing them to the loving care of the divine master who alone can comfort them in their affliction whereas this is the first meeting of this camp held since death has claimed as one of its victims the distinguished confederate soldier general james longstreet who departed this life on the 2d day of january 1904 at gainesville georgia and whereas this camp recognizes the great services rendered to the cause by the brilliant soldier and desires to render its meed of just tribute to the memory of the gallant officer and commander therefore be it that in the death of general james longstreet we mourn the loss of one of the most illustrious of the great generals who led our armies to victory on many a hardfought field against almost overwhelming odds gaining for our devoted armies a worldwide reputation that ranks them among the best soldiers of the age that these resolutions be entered in the records of our camp as a memento of our admiration and appreciation of this distinguished general and citizen and that a copy be sent to the family of the deceased whereas it has pleased almighty god to call to him the immortal soul of general james longstreet lieutenantgeneral in the army of the confederate states of america whose record as a broadminded citizen and conscientious upright and honorable officer in the various civil positions he has held is only excelled by the great service he rendered his country as the soldier and general whose bravery fortitude ability and devotion to duty was excelled by none whose fortunes were cast with his beneath the stars and bars and whereas there is among certain ones in the south a disposition to reflect upon his fidelity to the trust imposed upon him at the battle of gettysburg and place upon his shoulders the blame for general lees loss of that engagement be it that we deprecate the spirit that would induce one confederate soldier to stoop from the pedestal upon which history has placed him to deprive another of the honor to which he is justly entitled that we heartily approve of the course taken during his life by the late general longstreetin ignoring the attacks and calumnies heaped upon him by those who were his comrades in armsas showing the true greatness of the man that we further believe when the true facts are known an admiring and grateful people will place him second only to the immortal lee who though all the facts were known to him exhonerated longstreet from all blame saying the fault is mine that this camp do hereby attest its belief in his fidelity ability and high moral character and that the socalled gettysburg charges are not supported by authentic history or satisfactory evidence that we here extend to the family of general longstreet our heartfelt sympathy in this their and their nations loss and that one copy of these resolutions be mailed to mrs james longstreet one be printed in our local papers and another be spread on the minutes of this camp your committee respectfully recommend the following resolutions as to general longstreet whereas we have heard with deep regret of the recent death of general james longstreet commander forty years ago of the first corps army of northern virginia confederate states army therefore be it that in the death of general james longstreet the country at large has lost a true and tried leader of men and the confederate veterans have parted with a comrade and commander in whom they reposed implicit confidence and one ever ready to defend his cause against any foe foreign or domestic that the war that has been and is being waged on the military record of general longstreet for failure to do his duty at the battle of gettysburg is not in keeping in our opinion with the record as it is made up from the reports of general lee commanderinchief of the confederate army in that conflict if general longstreet had failed to execute the orders of general lee and been the cause of the defeat of the confederate army as is charged we believe he would have been courtmartialed and dismissed from the service instead of being retained and trusted on down to appomattox as he was that we deplore and deeply regret the action of the savannah chapter of the daughters of the confederacy in refusing a floral offering to be placed on the bier of general longstreet his heroic conduct as a soldier of the confederacy his wounds and sacrifices in our glorious but disastrous struggle for freedom would have certainly entitled him to the slight token of gratitude as he was passing out from among us forever whereas it has pleased an all wise providence to remove from this life lieutenantgeneral james longstreet commander of the first corps of the army of northern virginia and second ranking officer in that army and whereas in all the eventful campaigns of that army from manassas to appomattox general longstreet was a conspicuous figure enjoying the full confidence and affection of our peerless chieftain general robert e lee whose own right arm leaned on him for support and whereas in our second struggle for independence he displayed sincere devotion great military skill serene courage and an indomitable will and resolution which has shed honor upon southern arms and added lustre to the imperishable fame of southern soldiers and whereas he shed his blood freely in our behalf and at the end of the unequal contest sheathed a stainless sword which for four years had flashed in the front of battle and victory that we mourn with deep sorrow the death of this illustrious leader and will ever cherish with gratitude and admiration the memory of his example his sacrifices and his heroic achievements that we tender to his family our sincere sympathy in this great bereavement that a page be set apart in

the highest degree the courage chivalry and patriotism of the south upon a hundred of his countrys battlefields that in common with all citizens of the southland we lament his demise and honor and revere his memory for his great service to his country and his people as a soldier of the southern confederacy no braver heart beat beneath the confederate gray no more heroic soul paid allegiance to

of longstreets corps csa and of our deep sorrow at his death and to report and recommend suitable action by this camp respectfully submit the following general james longstreet was a native of south carolina born of an illustrious family distinguished alike for intellectual strength and nobility of character his love for his native state and the south was inherent and strengthened by associations early education and environments in keeping with his natural tastes and fitness for his chosen profession his education was completed at the military school of the united states at west point where he developed that strong and wonderful intellectual power of perception combination and comparison coupled with cool selfpossession knightly valor and lofty ambition which in the field of terrific war and deadly battle won for him the armies he led and the southern confederacy his diadem of glory as enduring as the history of the struggles of nations in freedoms cause general james longstreet was the friend comrade and companion of the matchless lee generals joseph e and albert sidney johnston of the incomparable stonewall jackson leonidas polk john b gordon and the other great leaders of the confederate army and was inspired with the same love of his native state and the south his love for his subalterns and privates of his army was as true and sincere as that of father to son many of the members of this camp knew him personally in the tent and on the march on the battlefield and in the dreadful charge heard his commands witnessed his noble deeds and listened to his kind words of encouragement and sympathy he was our comrade our friend and our great leader and there is a sting a sense of bereavement which finds some solace in the flowing tear and the glorious hope that we shall meet again he was a christian soldier that we regard it a duty which we owe to posterity that the state of georgia all surviving confederate veterans and especially those of longstreets corps should provide an equestrian statue of general longstreet to be erected on the capitol grounds at atlanta that a committee be appointed by the commander of this camp to inaugurate the movement and take all necessary steps to secure such a statue that camp no 763 u c v tenders to the widow and family of our beloved chieftain our heartfelt sympathy in the hour of their bereavement and sorrow that a copy of the foregoing be forwarded to the family that the action of the camp be published in the cobb county papers atlanta camp no 159 united confederate veterans in the following report pays glowing tribute to the memory of the late general james longstreet who died on january 2 at his home in gainesville georgia in the death of general james longstreet there passed away a notable and commanding figure of the army of northern virginia in the late civil war his history and service are indissolubly connected with all of the great movements of that army it would not be within the purview of this memorial to attempt to even epitomize the part he took in the many great battles coming into that struggle with a prestige and honor which shone with brilliant lustre on account of his intrepid bravery and gallantry as an officer of the army of the united states on many fields in mexico and being withal an educated and trained soldier a majestic man of mild manners and speech and of leonine courage his very name throughout the army and the whole country was a tower of strength from first manassas to appomattox his command and leadership held the first place among the great army corps of the greatest army that was ever marshalled in this or in any other country made a lieutenantgeneral in the early part of the war the conspicuous bravery skill and reliability shown by him in the very crisis of the battles of williamsburg and at seven pines and other great conflicts before richmond in 1862 won for him from general lee the sobriquet of the old warhorse after general lee had planned the advance on general pope and after jackson had passed through thoroughfare gap to the rear of general pope and when he was heavily engaged and sorely pressed lee and longstreet were passing through thoroughfare gap after a spirited contest at that mountainpass longstreets corps moved like a majestic stream on to the plains of manassas where his lines were quickly formed striking the enemy with the hand of mars the thunder of his guns greeted the ear of jackson giving hope and succor to his forces as the sound of the scottish bagpipes heralded the approach of the relieving column to the beleaguered garrison at lucknow the welldirected assault which he made in general popes front crowned the southern arms with complete victory the southern cause had no more loyal supporter nor courageous soldier than general longstreet as the honorable wounds and scars which he carried to his death abundantly attest he had the unbounded confidence of his commanderinchief the history of that great war gives but one record of longstreet being absent from his command and that was on account of serious wounds received on the field of the wilderness in may 1864 where in preparing to lead in person his forces against general hancocks corps he momentarily halted to receive a word of congratulation from general micah jenkins of south carolina when longstreets own men mistaking these two generals with the little group of horsemen composing their staff surrounding them for the enemy fired killing general jenkins and wounding general longstreet in the throat and shoulder from which he was ever afterwards maimed we would not omit to mention that in 1863 when several of his divisions were ordered from virginia to georgia to reinforce the army of tennessee on his arrival in atlanta and when at the old trout house at the junction of decatur and pryor streets where the old austell building now stands he was called to the balcony of the hotel to speak to the large and enthusiastic multitude of soldiers and citizens who thronged every inch of the two streets he said i came not to speak i came to meet the enemy the inspiration of his presence and this short and pithy declaration called forth from the assembled multitude the exclamation what a magnificent looking man and soldier how well he fulfilled his mission in the battle of chickamauga history makes no mistake in its record how his forces were hurled against those of general thomas and how his army turned the tide of battle into victory are too well known to need repetition in this battle like others where he led his advance was stubborn and decisive he followed with unfaltering bravery and devotion the fortunes of the confederacy until the last drama was enacted at appomattox and was a member of the last council of war held in the woods on the night of april 8 1865 and was the senior commissioner on the part of the confederate forces appointed by the commanderinchief to arrange the details and terms of the surrender of that little shattered band which through fire and smoke hunger and cold had stood by the flag of the confederacy through all the trying ordeals of four years grim and bloody strife the name and fame of general longstreet are the common heritage of the south and the whole american people the names of his immediate ancestors are historic and dear especially to every georgian his qualities as a soldier have won for him the highest encomiums not only of the southern people but from the northern people as well all true history including that written from an english standpoint places longstreet in the very first rank as to ability and generalship among any of lees subordinates no time nor mere political differences can affect or dim the lustre of that name the past is secure the future is safe we can say with all the emphasis that the words import that he was one of the bravest truest safest and the most devoted of the confederate leaders in the generations to come when passion and prejudice shall vanish like the mists of the morning at the presence of the clear sunlight of truth longstreets name shall receive at the hands of the entire civilized world the praise and honor to which it is justly entitled we may be permitted to refer briefly to an incident that occurred on the occasion of the unveiling of the ben hill monument in atlanta among the many distinguished exconfederate chieftains seated on the platform was expresident jefferson davis general longstreet came down from his home in gainesville clad in the full uniform of a lieutenantgeneral of the confederate army wearing his sword providing himself with a superb mount he rode out peachtree street to the site of the monument and dismounting walked unannounced to the platform into the outstretched arms of jefferson davis as they embraced each other they presented a scene worthy of the brush of a raphael or a rubens once heroes in common victory they were now heroes in common defeat this was a beautiful and shining example for all latter day critics this silent episode as if too impressive to be broken stilled the vast multitude for a moment and then spontaneously from forty thousand confederate veterans and citizens the ladies joining in the demonstration by waving their handkerchiefs there went up a loud and continuous shout of applause that rent the air let us never forget the four years of glorious service rendered by general longstreet to the lost cause and let the south erect a monument to his memory to tell to future generations that the south is never forgetful or indifferent to that glorious service rendered in the cause for which it fought and for which many bled and died general longstreet died in gainesville georgia january 2 1904 and was buried with military honors on the 6th day of the same month a detail from this camp as well as detachments from various military organizations joined in paying the last honor to the old soldier touching and beautiful was the kindly sympathy shown his memory by his neighbors in gainesville who were bound to him by ties that no time can sever never was a funeral more largely attended and more universal respect shown to the dead by the entire community in which he lived all places of business were closed the confederate veterans the public school children the college girls the citizens all joined in the procession which followed his remains to beautiful alta vista where on the crown of the hill overlooking the faraway blue ridge was laid to rest all that is mortal of the old battlescarred hero at a meeting of the old soldiers of houston county georgia to commemorate the birth of the immortal lee and also by previous arrangement to take cognizance and condolence of the death of general longstreet under whom many of these old soldiers served throughout the war the following resolutions were submitted and unanimously adopted that in the death of general james longstreet we sustain the loss of one of the most valiant and capable soldier commanders of the lost cause that while during the gigantic war and struggle between the states general lee regarded him as almost a part of himself my old warhorse in the carrying out and accomplishments of apparently at times the impossible against and over the enemy we view him as from behind the guns and under those conflicts whose fierceness and terrible results were sufficient to stagger and even turn back the stoutest manhood yet we never saw him evince the least fear turn his back in dishonor nor disobey his noble chieftain his war structure shows the hand of no ordinary builder and cannot be pulled down he carved his way through the ranks of the enemy in such a fashion that they themselves and their descendants admire the man for his great military ability nor can they be less thrilled by that chivalry and americanism he and so many others equally valorous and capable displayed and forged for conscience sake thus awakening and holding the world as never before in any age this was general james longstreet as we saw him then and without superficiality as we see him today through our vanishing memories and waning manhoods one of the greatest soldiers who crossed swords with the many gallant spirits of the other sidebrother americansover a principle which did not and thank god could not diea gift of god to humanity to stand for the right fight for the right and die for the right even though in failure that others may profit by it that we regret to have to antagonize and reprove even one chapter of that great good and soulful organization known as the daughters of the confederacy but we can neither endorse the spirit and sentiment nor the statement made by that savannah chapter that general longstreet disobeyed general lees order at the battle of gettysburg that we believe and would advise that the life and future good of that great organization lies in the thorough education of its chapters to correct history and a proper appreciation of the spirit and tenets of the ordera proper observance of its constitution that a copy of these resolutions be sent to mrs longstreet carrying with it as it does a sympathy love and sorrow such as only can be given by old soldiers bronzed by the same smoke buffeted by the same battles and scarred by the same fury through which he passed for the love of home and country for the love of truth and for the love of a cause then dearer than even life itself and for which so many gallant spirits went down that the home journal be requested to publish these proceedings another set of resolutions showing the esteem in which longstreets men held the dead general and the love that they bear for him were drawn up yesterday by mr a k wilson who was a member of longstreets corps and were signed by the veterans in the city who like mr wilson had been followers of the dead leader the resolutions were as follows comradesour comrade and our leader has left us he has gone to join the hosts on the other side of the great river and we that followed him at the manassases thoroughfare gap yorktown fairfax falls church munsons and uptons hills the wilderness where he received that wound said to be from his own men williamsburg sharpsburg to tennessee chickamauga knoxville lookout mountain missionary ridge back to virginia and on all the great fields on her soil testify to his worth with his corps back to virginia see him as he appeared at petersburg and countless other places of trust lastly with his ragged halfstarved barefooted remnant bearing scars as he bore them see him as he approaches appomattox his men drawing but one ear of corn for a days rations my comrades he needs no emblems history in time will give to him that which is due and those that were with him his survivors will ever hold his memory green like ourselves his services at appomattox show to the world that he was ever faithful to his enlistment and true to the cause that he espoused and his parting with lee establishes that fact now be it that we the survivors of longstreets corps tender to his bereaved family our heartfelt sympathy showing the love and esteem that we had for our dear old leader your committee appointed to report resolutions commemorative of the life and service of the late lieutenantgeneral james longstreet recommends the following that in the testimony of the estimate of old soldiers of his life and services to the south in the great war between the states camp hardee adopt the following statement general longstreet a south carolinian by birth a graduate of the west point military academy as a cadet from alabama while assured of position in the federal army resigned the commission he held in an established service to enter the unorganized poorly equipped army of the confederacy and undertook all the arduous duties and dangers of that war and fought it out to the disastrous end from the time of his appointment as brigadiergeneral under beauregard along the line of bull run creek in july 1861 to the surrender at appomattox in april 1865 he was distinguished as a stalwart skilful commander and a gallant soldier he was remarkable for staying qualities rather than for dash in all that brave service there was nothing spectacular but he was always steadfast true and reliable whatever may have been said of general longstreet it is remarkable that at no time for inefficiency or the absence of results or disobedience of order was he relieved of his command no other subordinate was so often intrusted with independent and difficult enterprises now that death has silenced all complaints and the great commander has gone to his reward we who survive him desire to crown his memory with the degree of praise which his great deeds wrought in behalf of his people so richly deserve as a soldier he was wholly faithful to the south and for that fidelity merits the grateful appreciation of our people such a great soul needs no defence time will cover with its mantle whatever has been charged as his faults it may be that in the great conservatism of his nature he saw more clearly what was best for his country in this hour of bereavement let us only remember that a great and gallant spirit has gone to his reward and therefore that this memorial be spread on the minutes of the camp and a copy be sent to the widow of the dead general with the assurance in this hour of her great bereavement she has the sympathy of camp w j hardee comrades we assemble to pay tribute to the memory of lieutenantgeneral longstreet one of our great chieftains for him taps have sounded lights are out and all is still this fearless leader is gone he was the hard fighter of northern virginia and his opponents always knew when he was in their front or directing the assault he had the confidence of his men and they loved him he led them but to victory the south admired and trusted him his name is enshrined with that of the army of northern virginia and when her history shall be gathered and cast into final form honorable will be the place assigned to our great general we would therefore recommend the adoption of the following tribute of esteem and respect whereas lieutenantgeneral longstreet recently passed away at his home in gainesville georgia and was buried amid the regrets and tears of many who had gathered from different parts of our southland to pay the respect due his illustrious name therefore be it that we bow our heads unto him who is the author and finisher of our career and acknowledge that while we can not always understand yet we know that he doeth all things well that the comrades of camp no 135 confederate veterans have heard with sorrow and regret of the death of this brave general and fearless commander educated in the profession of arms he gave the best years of his life to the service of his country for twentyfive years prior to the action which necessitated his state severing her connection with the union he most valiantly drew his sword in her defence through the mexican war and during the continuous troubles with the indians on our western plains his services were so conspicuous for gallantry that he attained the rank of major when his state could no longer remain in the union but withdrew he resigned his commission and cast his lot with that of his state as he had been gallant and successful in the army of the union he now became more so in the army of the confederacy the enlarged opportunities furnished what his great ability needed from the rank of major he rose rapidly to that of lieutenantgeneral and second in command to our peerless lee as brigadiergeneral at manassas he engaged the left wing of the enemy with the result that is familiar to all of us as majorgeneral he was selected to cover johnstons retreat in the peninsula he won williamsburg and was at seven pines for his service in the seven days fight around richmond congress rewarded him with the rank of senior lieutenantgeneral and second in command of all the confederate forces he was at the second manassas with jackson and at south mountain at sharpsburg he was knighted warhorse by his chieftain fredericksburg gettysburg chickamauga and the wilderness felt his presence while petersburg five forks and appomattox beheld his gallantry comrades we knew him we loved him we trusted him today we would pay him his tribute believing him to be worthy to be placed beside lee albert sidney and joseph e johnston and jackson that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of our camp copies be furnished each of our county papers for publication and that a copy be sent to mrs longstreet together with expressions of our sympathy by the adjutant comradeswe your committee appointed at a meeting held this day to draft resolutions upon the death of lieutenantgeneral james longstreet late commander of the first corps army of northern virginia beg leave to submit the following whereas it having pleased the deity to call our great commander to cross over the river and take permanent position with the majority of his old comrades who have preceded him therefore be it that in the death of general longstreet we realize the loss of the senior and last surviving lieutenantgeneral of the army of northern virginia and while freighted with the events of eightythree years and suffering from the effects of many wounds received in battle still he bore up with a fortitude becoming his great spirit that in his character we recognize the true patriot and soldier devotion to duty and a genius which added glory to our arms and inspired faith in our cause that in the remotest history his achievements will be appreciated with all the glory that came to us during that bloody drama while oblivion will shut out those who would assail his fair name that to his family we tender sincere condolence with the assurance that his kind consideration for his men courtly bearing and bravery will ever have a place in the memory of the survivors of his command who followed him from the first manassas to appomattox that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of this camp the adjutant to forward a copy to the family and that the state press be requested to publish same whereas the ruler of the universe has seen fit to call from his earthly home the spirit of general longstreet and take him to his home on high as a bright reward for his faithfulness and fidelity here in life general longstreet was as brave and gallant a soldier as wore the gray during the fierce struggle of the south he was known and loved throughout this fair sunny southland not only as a soldier and general who so gallantly and fearlessly led his men in the southern cause but as a true and noble man and when his final summons came and he laid down his earthly armor for a heavenly crown it cast a shadow over all the south that another of her brave generals who had so nobly defended her cause was no more but since he has left us and is no more among his family comrades and friends be it that this chapter of the daughters of the confederacy regrets with deepest sorrow the death of general longstreet and through this little tribute to his memory expresses its deepest and sincerest sympathy

recognized one of the ablest and most gallant soldiers of the lost cause as commander of one of the corps of the army of northern virginia his name is inseparably connected with the glory that rightly gathers about the achievements of that immortal organization true and faithful to his every conviction of duty and unswerving in his devotion to his country and people in the hour of their supremest trial and need his name deserves to be enrolled among the immortals of our southland that we extend to the bereaved family our deepest sympathy and that a copy of these resolutions be sent to the

family consisting of his wife and five children at the ripe old age of eightythree years lieutenantgeneral james longstreet a graduate of west point one of the heroes of the mexican war where he was desperately wounded in storming cherubusco and where he was twice brevetted for gallantry on the field of battleonce as captain for churubusco and again as major for molino del reya professional soldier in the army of the united states the highest in rank from the state of alabama at the time of the secession of that state he resigned from the united states army tendered his sword to alabama and from thenceforward was identified with the south in her immortal struggle for the right of local selfgovernment guaranteed to her in the constitution of the united states and as laid down in the declaration of independence from bull run to appomattox and at its close was recognized as the left arm of lee since his death his record as a soldier has been criticised at a time when he cannot defend himself but we congratulate the people of the south and the future historian that the congress of the confederate states february 17 1864 passed unanimously resolutions thanking lieutenantgeneral longstreet and his command for their patriotic services and brilliant achievements in virginia maryland pennsylvania georgia and tennessee and participating in nearly every great battle fought in those states the commanding general ever displaying great ability skill and prudence in command and the officers and men the most heroic bravery fortitude and energy in every duty that they have been called upon to perform this resolution was approved by jefferson davis and was adopted on the recommendation of the commanding general of the army of the confederate states of america the immortal robert e lee after the adoption of these resolutions nothing which we can say could add to his soldiers record he needs no defence we consign his name to history so long as mankind reads it they will find no brighter page than that written by longstreets corps he illustrated the south in a long life the best years of it devoted to her and her cause he sacrificed to serve her as much as any other one man he fought a score of battles for her and never one against her and this state over his grave mingle their tears with those of the people whom he served and the devoted family who survive him therefore that the army of the confederate states of america is rapidly passing to the great beyond leaving a record a part of the history of the american people to which we point with pride and to which in a few generations civilized man will look and admit that it illustrated the highest type of american citizenship that we extend our sympathies to the surviving family of general longstreet and to the south at his death and that a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions be furnished to his family and to the press as one of his defenders in the interest of
