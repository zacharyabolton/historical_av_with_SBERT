here i am at your service madame idleness waiting for any suggestion it may please you to put in my weary brain as a means to pass this dull cloudy sunday afternoon for the great pike clock over the way has this instant struck only halfpast three and if a rain is added to the high wind that has been blowing ever since the month commenced and prevents my going to mrs brunots before dark i fear i shall fall a victim to the blues for the first time in my life indeed it is dull miriam went to linewood with lydia yesterday and i miss them beyond all expression miriam is so funny she says she cannot live without me and yet she can go away and stay for months without missing me in the slightest degree extremely funny and i well it is absurd to fancy myself alive without miriam she would rather not visit with me and yet be it for an hour or a month i never halfway enjoy myself without her away from home miriam is my rock ahead in life ill founder on her yet its a grand sight for people out of reach who will not come in contact with the breakers but it is quite another thing to me perpetually dancing on those sharp points in my little cockleshell that forms so ludicrous a contrast to the grand scene around i am sure to founder i hold that every family has at heart one genius in some line no matter what except in our family where each is a genius in his own way hem and miriam has a genius for the piano now i never could bear to compete with any one knowing that it is the law of my being to be inferior to others consequently to fail and failure is so humiliating to me so it is that people may force me to abandon any pursuit by competing with me for knowing that failure is inevitable rather than fight against destiny i give up de bonne grce originally i was said to have a talent for the piano as well as miriam sister and miss isabella said i would make a better musician than she having more patience and perseverance however i took hardly six months lessons to her ever so many years heard how well she played got disgusted with myself and gave up the piano at fourteen with spasmodic fits of playing every year or so at sixteen harry gave me a guitar here was a new field where i would have no competitors i knew no one who played on it so i set to work and taught myself to manage it mother only teaching me how to tune it but miriam took a fancy to it and i taught her all i knew but as she gained i lost my relish and if she had not soon abandoned it i would know nothing of it now she does not know half that i do about it they tell me i play much better than she yet they let her play on it in company before me and i cannot pretend to play after why is it it is not vanity or i would play confident of excelling her it is not jealousy for i love to see her show her talents it is not selfishness i love her too much to be selfish to her what is it then simply lack of selfesteem i would say if there was no phrenologist near to correct me and point out that welldeveloped hump at the extreme southern and heavenward portion of my morgan head selfesteem or not mr phrenologist the result is that miriam is by far the best performer in baton rouge and i would rank fortythird even in the delectable village of jackson and yet i must have some ear for music to know as many songs as sarah is a family proverb not very difficult songs or very beautiful ones to be sure besides being very indifferently sung but the tunes will run in my head and it must take some ear to catch them people say to me of course you play to which i invariably respond oh no but miriam plays beautifully you sing i believe not at all except for father that is what i used to say and the children but miriam sings you are fond of dancing very but i cannot dance as well as miriam of course you are fond of society no indeed miriam is and she goes to all the parties and returns all the visits for me the consequence is that if the person who questions is a stranger he goes off satisfied that that miriam must be a great girl but that little sister of hers well a prig to say the least so it is miriam catches all my fish and so it is too that it is not raining and im off until that dreary 1861 i had no idea of sorrow or grief how i love to think of myself at that time not as myself but as some happy careless child who danced through life loving gods whole world too much to love any particular one outside of her own family she was more childish then yet i like her for all her folly i can say it now for she is as dead as though she was lying underground now do not imagine that sarah has become an aged lady in the fifteen months that have elapsed since for it is no such thing her heart does ache occasionally but that is a secret between her and this little rosewood furnished room and when she gets over it there is no one more fond of making wheelbarrows of the children or of catching charlie or mother by the foot and making them play lame chicken now all this done by a young lady who remembers eighteen months ago with so much regret that she has lost so much of her high spirits might argue that her spirits were before tremendous and yet they were not that other sarah was ladylike i am sure in her wildest moments but there is something hurried and boisterous in this ones tricks that reminds me of some one who is making a merit of being jolly under depressing circumstances no that is not a nice sarah now to my taste the commencement of 61 promised much pleasure for the rest of the year and though secession was talked about i do not believe any one anticipated the war that has been desolating our country ever since with no prospect of terminating for some time to come true the garrison was taken but then several pleasant officers of the louisiana army were stationed there and made quite an agreeable addition to our small parties and we did not think for a moment that trouble would grow out of it at least we girls did not next louisiana seceded but still we did not trouble ourselves with gloomy anticipations for many strangers visited the town and our parties rides and walks grew gayer and more frequent one little party shall i ever forget it was on the 9th of march i think such an odd funny little party such queer things happened what a fool mr mcg made of himself even more so than usual but hush its not fair to laugh at a lady under peculiar circumstances and he tried so hard to make himself agreeable poor fellow that i ought to like him for being so obedient to my commands say something new something funny i said tired of a subject on which he had been expatiating all the evening for i had taken a long ride with him before sunset he had escorted me to mrs brunots and here he was still at my side and his conversation did not interest me to hear with him was to obey something funny well here he commenced telling something about somebody the fun of which seemed to consist in the somebodys having knocked his shins against something else i only listened to the latter part i was bored and showed it shins was i to laugh at such a story day before yesterday just about this time of evening as i came home from the graveyard jimmy unexpectedly came in ever since the 12th of february he has been waiting on the yankees pleasure in the mississippi at all places below columbus and having been under fire for thirteen days at tiptonville island no 10 having surrendered monday night and commodore hollins thinking it high time to take possession of the ironclad ram at new orleans and give them a small party below the forts he carried off his little aide from the mcrae tuesday morning and left him here thursday evening to our infinite delight for we felt as though we would never again see our dear little jimmy he has grown so tall and stout that it is really astonishing considering the short time he has been away to our great distress he jumped up from dinner and declared he must go to the city on the very next boat commodore hollins would need him he must be at his post etc and in twenty minutes he was off the rascal before we could believe he had been here at all there is something in his eye that reminds me of harry and tells me that like hal he will die young and these days that are going by remind me of hal too i am walking in our footsteps of last year the eighth was the day we gave him a party on his return home i see him so distinctly standing near the pier table talking to mr sparks whom he had met only that morning and who three weeks after had harrys blood upon his hands he is a murderer now without aim or object in life as before with only one desire to die and death still flees from him and he dares not rid himself of life all those dancing there that night have undergone trial and affliction since father is dead and harry mr trezevant lies at corinth with his skull fractured by a bullet every young man there has been in at least one battle since and every woman has cried over her son brother or sweetheart going away to the wars or lying sick and wounded and yet we danced that night and never thought of bloodshed the week before louisiana seceded jack wheat stayed with us and we all liked him so much and he thought so much of us and last week a week ago today he was killed on the battlefield of shiloh among the many who visited us in the beginning of 1861 there was mr bradford i took a dislike to him the first time i ever saw him and being accustomed to say just what i pleased to all the other gentlemen tried it with him it was at dinner and for a long while i had the advantage and though father would sometimes look grave gibbes and all at my end of the table would scream with laughter at last mr bradford commenced to retaliate and my dislike changed into respect for a man who could make an excellent repartee with perfect goodbreeding and after dinner when the others took their leave and he asked permission to remain during his visit which lasted until ten oclock he had gone over such a variety of subjects conversing so well upon all that miriam and i were so interested that we forgot to have the gas lit and another was silly little mr br my little golden calf what a dont call names i owe him a grudge for cold hands and the other day when i heard of his being wounded at shiloh i could not help laughing a little at tom brs being hurt what was the use of throwing a nice big cannon ball that might have knocked a man down away on that poor little fellow when a pea from a popgun would have made the same impression not but what he is brave but little mrbr is so soft then there was that rattlebrain mr tt who commencing one subject never ceased speaking until he had touched on all one evening he came in talking and never paused even for a reply until he bowed himself out talking still when mr bradford who had been forced to silence as well as the rest threw himself back with a sigh of relief and exclaimed this man talks like a woman i thought it the best description of mr tts conversation i had ever heard it was all on the surface no pretensions to anything except to put the greatest possible number of words of no meaning in one sentence while speaking of the most trivial thing night or day mr tt never passed home without crying out to me ces jolis yeux bleus and if the parlor were brightly lighted so that all from the street might see us and be invisible to us themselves i always nodded my head to the outer darkness and laughed no matter who was present though it sometimes created remark you see i knew the joke coming from a party escorted by mr br miriam by mr tt we had to wait a long time before rose opened the door which interval i employed in dancing up and down the gallery followed by my cavalier singing which nave remark mr br not speaking french lost entirely and mr tt endorsed it with his approbation and belief in it and ever afterwards called me ces jolis yeux bleus another date in hals short history i see myself walking home with mr mcg just after sundown meeting miriam and dr woods at the gate only that was a friday instead of a saturday as this from the other side mr sparks comes up and joins us we stand talking in the bright moonlight which makes miriam look white and statuelike i am holding roses in my hand in return for which one little pansy has been begged from my garden and is now figuring as a shirtstud i turn to speak to that man of whom i said to dr woods before i even knew his name who is this man who passes here so constantly i feel that i shall hate him to my dying day he told me his name was sparks a good harmless fellow etc and afterwards when i did know him dr woods would ask every time we met well do you hate sparks yet i could not really hate any one in my heart so i always answered he is a goodnatured fool but i will hate him yet but even now i cannot my only feeling is intense pity for the man who has dealt us so severe a blow who made my dear father bow his gray head and shed such bitter tears the moon is rising still higher now and people are hurrying to the grand meeting where the state of the country is to be discussed and the three young men bow and hurry off too later at eleven oclock miriam and i are up at lydias waiting until the boat comes with miss comstock who is going away as usual i am teasing and romping by turns harry suddenly stands in the parlor door looking very grave and very quiet he is holding fathers stick in his hand and says he has come to take us over home i was laughing still so i said wait while i prepared for some last piece of folly but he smiled for the first time and throwing his arm around me said come home you rogue and laughing still i followed him he left us in the hall saying he must go to charlies a moment but to leave the door open for him so we went up and i ran in his room and lighted his gas for him as i did every night when we went up together in a little while i heard him come in and go to his room i knew nothing then but next day going into mothers room i saw him standing before the glass door of her armoir looking at a black coat he had on involuntarily i cried out oh dont hal dont what is nt it a nice coat he asked yes but it is buttoned up to the throat and i dont like to see it it looks here i went out as abruptly as i came in that black coat so tightly buttoned troubled me he came to our room after a while and said he was going ten miles out in the country for a few days i begged him to stay and reproached him for going away so soon after he had come home but he said he must adding perhaps i am tired of you and want to see something new ill be so glad to get back in a few days father said yes he must go so he went without any further explanation walking out to mr davidsons that evening lydia and i sat down on a fallen rail beyond the catholic graveyard and there she told me what had happened the night before sitting on dr woodss gallery with six or eight others who had been singing hal called on mr henderson to sing he complied by singing one that was not nice old mr sparks got up to leave and hal said i hope we are not disturbing you no he said he was tired and would go home as soon as he was gone his son who i have since heard was under the influence of opium though hal always maintained that he was not said it was a shame to disturb his poor old father hal answered you heard what he said we did not disturb him you are a liar the other cried that is a name that none of our family has either merited or borne with and quick as thought hal sprang to his feet and struck him across the face with the walkingstick he held the blow sent the lower part across the balcony in the street as the spring was loosened by it while the upper part to which was fastened the sword for it was fathers swordcane remained in his hand i doubt that he ever before knew the cane could come apart certainly he did not perceive it until the other whined piteously he was taking advantage over an unarmed man when cursing him he harry threw it after the body of the cane and said now we are equal the others answer was to draw a knife and was about to plunge it into harry who disdained to flinch when mr henderson threw himself on mr sparks and dragged him off it was a little while after that harry came for us the consequence of this was a challenge from mr sparks in the morning which was accepted by harrys friends who appointed monday at greenwell to meet lydia did not tell me that she said she thought it had been settled peaceably so i was not uneasy and only wanted harry to come back from seth davids soon the possibility of his fighting never occurred to me sunday evening i was on the front steps with miriam and dr woods talking of harry and wishing he would come you want harry the doctor repeated after me you had better learn to live without him what an absurdity i said and wondered when he would come still later miriam father and i were in the parlor when there was a tap on the window just above his head and i saw a hand for an instant father hurried out and we heard several voices and then steps going away mother came down and asked who had been there but we only knew that whoever it was father had afterward gone with them mother went on there is something going on which is to be kept from me every one seems to know it and to make a secret of it i said nothing for i had promised lydia not to tell and even i did not know all when father came back harry was with him i saw by his nod and how are you girls how he wished us to take it so neither moved from our chairs while he sat down on the sofa and asked what kind of a sermon we had had and we talked of anything except what we were thinking of until we went upstairs hal afterwards told me that he had been arrested up there and father went with him to give bail and that the sheriff had gone out to greenwell after mr sparks he told me all about it next morning saying he was glad it was all over but sorry for mr sparks for he had a blow on his face which nothing would wash out i said hal if you had fought much as i love you i would rather he had killed you than that you should have killed him i love you too much to be willing to see blood on your hands first he laughed at me then said if i had killed him i never would have seen you again we thought it was all over so did he but baton rouge was wild about it mr sparks was the bully of the town having nothing else to do and whenever he got angry or drunk would knock down anybody he chose that same night before harry met him he had slapped one man and had dragged another over the room by the hair but these coolly went home and waited for a voluntary apology so the mothers sisters and intimate friends of those who had patiently borne the blows and being woolled vaunted the example of their heroes and asked why dr morgan had not acted as they had done and waited for an apology then there was another faction who cried only blood could wash out that blow and make a gentleman of mr sparks again as though he ever had been one so knots assembled at street corners and discussed it until father said to us that monday night these people are so excited and are trying so hard to make this affair worse that i would not be surprised if they shot each other down in the street speaking of harry and the other hal seemed to think of it no more though and wednesday said he must go to the city and consult brother as to where he should permanently establish himself i was sorry yet glad that he would then get away from all this trouble i dont know that i ever saw him in higher spirits than he was that day and evening the 24th lilly and charlie were here until late and he laughed and talked so incessantly that we called him crazy we might have guessed by his extravagant spirits that he was trying to conceal something from us he went away before daybreak and i never saw him again there is no word in the english language that can express the state in which we are and have been these last three days day before yesterday news came early in the morning of three of the enemys boats passing the forts and then the excitement began it increased rapidly on hearing of the sinking of eight of our gunboats in the engagement the capture of the forts and last night of the burning of the wharves and cotton in the city while the yankees were taking possession today the excitement has reached the point of delirium i believe i am one of the most selfpossessed in my small circle and yet i feel such a craving for news of miriam and mother and jimmy who are in the city that i suppose i am as wild as the rest it is nonsense to tell me i am cool with all these patriotic and enthusiastic sentiments nothing can be positively ascertained save that our gunboats are sunk and theirs are coming up to the city everything else has been contradicted until we really do not know whether the city has been taken or not we only know we had best be prepared for anything so day before yesterday lilly and i sewed up our jewelry which may be of use if we have to fly i vow i will not move one step unless carried away come what will here i remain we went this morning to see the cotton burning a sight never before witnessed and probably never again to be seen wagons drays everything that can be driven or rolled were loaded with the bales and taken a few squares back to burn on the commons negroes were running around cutting them open piling them up and setting them afire all were as busy as though their salvation depended on disappointing the yankees later charlie sent for us to come to the river and see him fire a flatboat loaded with the precious material for which the yankees are risking their bodies and souls up and down the levee as far as we could see negroes were rolling it down to the brink of the river where they would set them afire and push the bales in to float burning down the tide each sent up its wreath of smoke and looked like a tiny steamer puffing away only i doubt that from the source to the mouth of the river there are as many boats afloat on the mississippi the flatboat was piled with as many bales as it could hold without sinking most of them were cut open while negroes staved in the heads of barrels of alcohol whiskey etc and dashed bucketsful over the cotton others built up little chimneys of pine every few feet lined with pine knots and loose cotton to burn more quickly there piled the length of the whole levee or burning in the river lay the work of thousands of negroes for more than a year past it had come from every side men stood by who owned the cotton that was burning or waiting to burn they either helped or looked on cheerfully charlie owned but sixteen bales a matter of some fifteen hundred dollars but he was the head man of the whole affair and burned his own as well as the property of others a single barrel of whiskey that was thrown on the cotton cost the man who gave it one hundred and twentyfive dollars it shows what a nation in earnest is capable of doing only two men got on the flatboat with charlie when it was ready it was towed to the middle of the river set afire in every place and then they jumped into a little skiff fastened in front and rowed to land the cotton floated down the mississippi one sheet of living flame even in the sunlight it would have been grand at night but then we will have fun watching it this evening anyway for they cannot get through today though no time is to be lost hundreds of bales remained untouched an incredible amount of property has been destroyed today but no one begrudges it every grogshop has been emptied and gutters and pavements are floating with liquors of all kinds so that if the yankees are fond of strong drink they will fare ill yesterday mr hutchinson and a dr moffat called to ask for me with a message about jimmy i was absent but they saw lilly jimmy they said was safe though sick in bed he had sprung up and had rushed to the wharf at the first tap of the alarm bell in new orleans but as nothing could be done he would probably be with us today bringing mother and miriam i have neither heard nor seen more the mcrae they said went to the bottom with the others they did not know whether any one aboard had escaped god be praised that jimmy was not on her then the new boat to which he was appointed is not yet finished so he is saved i am distressed about captain huger and could not refrain from crying he was so good to jimmy but i remembered miss cammack might think it rather tender and obtrusive so i dried my eyes and began to hope he had escaped oh how glad i should be to know he has suffered no harm mr hutchinson was on his way above going to join others where the final battle is to be fought on the mississippi he had not even time to sit down so i was doubly grateful to him for his kindness i wish i could have thanked him for being so considerate of me in my distress now in her agitation lilly gave him a letter i had been writing to george when i was called away and begged him to address it and mail it at vicksburg or somewhere for no mail will leave here for norfolk for a long while to come the odd part is that he does not know george but he said he would gladly take charge of it and remember the address which lilly told him was richmond well if the yankees get it they will take it for an insane scrawl i wanted to calm his anxiety about us though i was so wildly excited that i could only say dont mind us we are safe but fight george fight for us the repetition was ludicrous i meant so much too i only wanted him to understand he could best defend us there ah mr yankee if you had but your brothers in this world and their lives hanging by a thread you too might write wild letters and if you want to know what an excited girl can do just call and let me show you the use of a small sevenshooter and a large carvingknife which vibrate between my belt and my pocket always ready for emergencies what a day last night came a dispatch that new orleans was under british protection and could not be bombarded consequently the enemys gunboats would probably be here this morning such few as had succeeded in passing the forts from nine to fifteen it was said and the forts they said had not surrendered i went to church but i grew very anxious before it was over feeling that i was needed at home when i returned i found lilly wild with excitement picking up hastily whatever came to hand preparing for instant flight she knew not where the yankees were in sight the town was to be burned we were to run to the woods etc if the house had to be burned i had to make up my mind to run too so my treasurebag tied around my waist as a bustle a sack with a few necessary articles hanging on my arm some few quite unnecessary ones too as i had not the heart to leave the old and new prayer books father had given me and miriams too pistol and carvingknife ready i stood awaiting the exodus i heaped on the bed the treasures i wanted to burn matches lying ready to fire the whole at the last minute i may here say that when all was over i found i had omitted many things from the holocaust this very diary was not included it would have afforded vast amusement to the yankees there may yet be occasion to burn them and the house also people fortunately changed their minds about the autodaf just then and the yankees have not yet arrived at sundown so when the excitement calmed down poor lilly tumbled in bed in a high fever in consequence of terror and exertion i was right in that prophecy for this was not the will pinckney i saw last so woebegone so subdued careworn and sad no trace of his once merry self he is goodlooking which he never was before but i would rather never have seen him than have found him so changed i was talking to a ghost his was a sad story he had held one bank of the river until forced to retreat with his men as their cartridges were exhausted and general lovell omitted sending more they had to pass through swamps wading seven and a half miles up to their waists in water he gained the edge of the swamp saw they were over the worst and fell senseless two of his men brought him milk and woke him up he said his men fell from exhaustion were lost and died in the swamp so that out of five hundred but one hundred escaped this he told quietly and sadly looking so heartbroken that it was piteous to see such pain he showed me his feet with thick clumsy shoes which an old negro had pulled off to give him for his were lost in the swamp and he came out barefooted they reached the lafourche river i believe seized a boat and arrived here last night his wife and child were aboard heaven knows how they got there the men he sent on to port hudson while he stopped here i wanted to bring his wife to stay with us but he said she could not bear to be seen as she had run off just as she had happened to be at that moment in half an hour he would be off to take her to his old home in a carriage there he would rejoin his men on the railroad and march from clinton to the jackson road and so on to corinth a long journey for men so disheartened but they will conquer in the end beauregards army will increase rapidly at this rate the whole country is aroused and every man who owns a gun and many who do not are on the road to corinth we will conquer yet vile old yankee boats four in number passed up this morning without stopping after all our excitement this silent contempt annihilated me what in the world do they mean the river was covered with burning cotton perhaps they want to see where it came from our lawful owners have at last arrived about sunset day before yesterday the iroquois anchored here and a graceful young federal stepped ashore carrying a yankee flag over his shoulder and asked the way to the mayors office i like the style if we girls of baton rouge had been at the landing instead of the men that yankee would never have insulted us by flying his flag in our faces we would have opposed his landing except under a flag of truce but the men let him alone and he even found a poor dutchman willing to show him the road he did not accomplish much said a formal demand would be made next day and asked if it was safe for the men to come ashore and buy a few necessaries when he was assured the air of baton rouge was very unhealthy for yankee soldiers at night he promised very magnanimously not to shell us out if we did not molest him but i notice none of them dare set their feet on terra firma except the officer who has now called three times on the mayor and who is said to tremble visibly as he walks the streets last evening came the demand the town must be surrendered immediately the federal flag must be raised they would grant us the same terms they granted new orleans jolly terms those were the answer was worthy of a southerner it was the town was defenseless if we had cannon there were not men enough to resist but if forty vessels lay at the landing it was intimated we were in their power and more ships coming up we would not surrender if they wanted they might come and take us if they wished the federal flag hoisted over the arsenal they might put it up for themselves the town had no control over government property glorious what a pity they did not shell the town but they are taking us at our word and this morning they are landing at the garrison all devices signs and flags of the confederacy shall be suppressed so says picayune butler good i devote all my red white and blue silk to the manufacture of confederate flags as soon as one is confiscated i make another until my ribbon is exhausted when i will sport a duster emblazoned in high colors hurra for the bonny blue flag henceforth i wear one pinned to my bosom not a duster but a little flag the man who says take it off will have to pull it off for himself the man who dares attempt it well a pistol in my pocket fills up the gap i am capable too this is a dreadful war to make even the hearts of women so bitter i hardly know myself these last few weeks i who have such a horror of bloodshed consider even killing in selfdefense murder who cannot wish them the slightest evil whose only prayer is to have them sent back in peace to their own country i talk of killing them for what else do i wear a pistol and carvingknife i am afraid i will try them on the first one who says an insolent word to me yes and repent for it ever after in sackcloth and ashes o if i was only a man then i could don the breeches and slay them with a will if some few southern women were in the ranks they could set the men an example they would not blush to follow pshaw there are no women here we are all men last night about one oclock i was wakened and told that mother and miriam had come oh how glad i was i tumbled out of bed half asleep and hugged miriam in a dream but waked up when i got to mother they came up under a flag of truce on a boat going up for provisions which by the way was brought to by half a dozen yankee ships in succession with a threat to send a broadside into her if she did not stop the wretches knew it must be under a flag of truce no boats leave except by special order to procure provisions what tales they had to tell they were on the wharf and saw the ships sail up the river saw the broadside fired into will pinckneys regiment the boats we fired our gunboats floating down to meet them all wrapped in flames twenty thousand bales of cotton blazing in a single pile molasses and sugar thrown over everything they stood there opposite to where one of the ships landed expecting a broadside and resolute not to be shot in the back i wish i had been there and captain huger is not dead they had hopes of his life for the first time day before yesterday miriam saw the ball that had just been extracted he will probably be lame for the rest of his life it will be a glory to him for even the federal officers say that never did they see so gallant a little ship or one that fought so desperately as the mcrae men and officers fought like devils think of all those great leviathans after the poor little widow mickey one came tearing down on her sideways while the brooklyn fired on her from the other side when brave captain warley put the nose of the manassas under the first and tilted her over so that the whole broadside passed over instead of through the mcrae who spit back its poor little fire at both and after all was lost she carried the wounded and the prisoners to new orleans and was scuttled by her own men in port glorious captain huger and think of his sending word to jimmy suffering as he was that his little brass cannon was game to the last oh i hope he will recover brave daredevil captain warley is prisoner and on the way to fort warren that home of all brave patriotic men well have him out and my poor little jimmy if i have not spoken of him it is not because i have lost sight of him for a moment the day the mcrae went down he arose from his bed ill as he was and determined to rejoin her as his own boat the mississippi was not ready when he reached the st charles he fell so very ill that he had to be carried back to brothers only his desperate illness saved him from being among the killed or wounded on that gallant little ship a few days after he learned the fate of the ship and was told that captain huger was dead no wonder he should cry so bitterly for captain huger was as tender and as kind to him as his own dear father god bless him for it the enemys ships were sailing up so he threw a few articles in a carpetbag and started off for richmond corinth anywhere to fight sick weak hardly able to stand he went off two weeks ago yesterday we know not where and we have never heard from him since whether he succumbed to that jaundice and the rest and lies dead or dying on the road god only knows we can only wait and pray god to send dear little jimmy home in safety and this is war heaven save me from like scenes and experiences again i was wild with excitement last night when miriam described how the soldiers marching to the depot waved their hats to the crowds of women and children shouting god bless you ladies we will fight for you and they waving their handkerchiefs sobbed with one voice god bless you soldiers fight for us we too have been having our fun early in the evening four more gunboats sailed up here we saw them from the corner three squares off crowded with men even up in the riggings the american flag was flying from every peak it was received in profound silence by the hundreds gathered on the banks i could hardly refrain from a groan much as i once loved that flag i hate it now i came back and made myself a confederate flag about five inches long slipped the staff in my belt pinned the flag to my shoulder and walked downtown to the consternation of women and children who expected something awful to follow an old negro cried my young missus got her flag flyin anyhow nettie made one and hid it in the folds of her dress but we were the only two who ventured we went to the state house terrace and took a good look at the brooklyn which was crowded with people who took a good look at us likewise the picket stationed at the garrison took alarm at half a dozen men on horseback and ran saying that the citizens were attacking the kind officers aboard the ship sent us word that if they were molested the town would be shelled let them butchers does it take thirty thousand men and millions of dollars to murder defenseless women and children o the great nation bravo i i am disgusted with myself no unusual thing but i am peculiarly disgusted this time last evening i went to mrs brunots without an idea of going beyond with my flag flying again they were all going to the state house so i went with them to my great distress some fifteen or twenty federal officers were standing on the first terrace stared at like wild beasts by the curious crowd i had not expected to meet them and felt a painful conviction that i was unnecessarily attracting attention by an unladylike display of defiance from the crowd gathered there but what was i to do i felt humiliated conspicuous everything that is painful and disagreeable but strike my colors in the face of the enemy never nettie and sophie had them too but that was no consolation for the shame i suffered by such a display so totally distasteful to me how i wished myself away and chafed at my folly and hated myself for being there and every one for seeing me i hope it will be a lesson to me always to remember a lady can gain nothing by such display i was not ashamed of the flag of my country i proved that by never attempting to remove it in spite of my mortification but i was ashamed of my position for these are evidently gentlemen not the billy wilsons crew we were threatened with fine noblelooking men they were showing refinement and gentlemanly bearing in every motion one cannot help but admire such foes they set us an example worthy of our imitation and one we would be benefited by following they come as visitors without either pretensions to superiority or the insolence of conquerors they walk quietly their way offering no annoyance to the citizens though they themselves are stared at most unmercifully and pursued by crowds of ragged little boys while even men gape at them with open mouths they prove themselves gentlemen while many of our citizens have proved themselves boors and i admire them for their conduct with a conviction that i had allowed myself to be influenced by bigoted narrow minded people in believing them to be unworthy of respect or regard i came home wonderfully changed in all my newly acquired sentiments resolved never more to wound their feelings who were so careful of ours by such unnecessary display and i hung my flag on the parlor mantel there to wave if it will in the shades of private life but to make a show make me conspicuous and ill at ease as i was yesterday never again there was a dozen officers in church this morning and the psalms for the 11th day seemed so singularly appropriate to the feelings of the people that i felt uncomfortable for them they answered with us though i am beginning to believe that we are even of more importance in baton rouge than we thought we were it is laughable to hear the things a certain set of people who know they cant visit us say about the whole family when father was alive they dared not talk about us aloud beyond calling us the proud morgans and the aristocracy of baton rouge but now father is gone the people imagine we are public property to be criticized vilified and abused to their hearts content and now because they find absurdities dont succeed they try improbabilities so yesterday the town was in a ferment because it was reported the federal officers had called on the miss morgans and all the gentlemen were anxious to hear how they had been received one had the grace to say if they did they received the best lesson there that they could get in town those young ladies would meet them with the true southern spirit the rest did not know they would like to find out i suppose the story originated from the fact that we were unwilling to blackguard yes that is the word the federal officers here and would not agree with many of our friends in saying they were liars thieves murderers scoundrels the scum of the earth etc such epithets are unworthy of ladies i say and do harm rather than advance our cause let them be what they will it shall not make me less the lady i say it is unworthy of anything except low newspaper war such abuse and i will not join in i have a brotherinlaw in the federal army whom i love and respect as much as any one in the world and shall not readily agree that his being a northerner would give him an irresistible desire to pick my pockets and take from him all power of telling the truth no there are few men i admire more than major drum and i honor him for his independence in doing what he believes right let us have liberty of speech and action in our land i say but not gross abuse and calumny shall i acknowledge that the people we so recently called our brothers are unworthy of consideration and are liars cowards dogs not i if they conquer us i acknowledge them as a superior race i will not say that we were conquered by cowards for where would that place us it will take a brave people to gain us and that the northerners undoubtedly are i would scorn to have an inferior foe i fight only my equals these women may acknowledge that cowards have won battles in which their brothers were engaged but i i will ever say mine fought against brave men and won the day which is most honorable i was never a secessionist for i quietly adopted fathers views on political subjects without meddling with them but even father went over with his state and when so many outrages were committed by the fanatical leaders of the north though he regretted the union said fight to the death for our liberty i say so too i want to fight until we win the cause so many have died for i dont believe in secession but i do in liberty i want the south to conquer dictate its own terms and go back to the union for i believe that apart inevitable ruin awaits both it is a rope of sand this confederacy founded on the doctrine of secession and will not last many years not five the north cannot subdue us we are too determined to be free they have no right to confiscate our property to pay debts they themselves have incurred death as a nation rather than union on such terms we will have our rights secured on so firm a basis that it can never be shaken if by power of overwhelming numbers they conquer us it will be a barren victory over a desolate land we the natives of this loved soil will be beggars in a foreign land we will not submit to despotism under the garb of liberty the north will find herself burdened with an unparalleled debt with nothing to show for it except deserted towns burning homes a standing army which will govern with no small caprice and an impoverished land if that be treason make the best of it one of these days when peace is restored and we are quietly settled in our allotted corners of this wide world without any particularly exciting event to alarm us and with the knowledge of what is now the future and will then be the dead past seeing that all has been for the best for us in the end that all has come right in spite of us we will wonder how we could ever have been foolish enough to await each hour in such breathless anxiety we will ask ourselves if it was really true that nightly as we lay down to sleep we did not dare plan for the morning feeling that we might be homeless and beggars before the dawn how unreal it will then seem we will say it was our wild imagination perhaps but how bitterly horribly true it is now four days ago the yankees left us to attack vicksburg leaving their flag flying in the garrison without a man to guard it and with the understanding that the town would be held responsible for it it was intended for a trap and it succeeded for night before last it was pulled down and torn to pieces now unless will will have the kindness to sink a dozen of their ships up there i hear he has command of the lower batteries they will be back in a few days and will execute their threat of shelling the town if they do what will become of us all we expect in the way of earthly property is as yet mere paper which will be so much trash if the south is ruined as it consists of debts due father by many planters for professional services rendered who of course will be ruined too so all money is gone that is nothing we will not be ashamed to earn our bread so let it go but this house is at least a shelter from the weather all sentiment apart and our servants too how could they manage without us the yankees on the river and a band of guerrillas in the woods are equally anxious to precipitate a fight between the two fires what chance for us it would take only a little while to burn the city over our heads they say the women and children must be removed these guerrillas where please charlie says we must go to greenwell and have this house pillaged for butler has decreed that no unoccupied house shall be respected if we stay through the battle if the federals are victorious we will suffer for the officers here were reported to have said if the people here did not treat them decently they would know what it was when billy wilsons crew arrived they would give them a lesson that select crowd is now in new orleans heaven help us when they reach here it is in these small cities that the greatest outrages are perpetrated what are we to do a new proclamation from butler has just come it seems that the ladies have an ugly way of gathering their skirts when the federals pass to avoid any possible contact some even turn up their noses unladylike to say the least but it is maybe owing to the odor they have which is said to be unbearable even at this early season of the year butler says whereas the socalled ladies of new orleans insult his men and officers he gives one and all permission to insult any or all who so treat them then and there with the assurance that the women will not receive the slightest protection from the government and that the men will all be justified i did not have time to read it but repeat it as it was told to me by mother who is in utter despair at the brutality of the thing these men our brothers not mine let us hope for the honor of their nation that butler is not counted among the gentlemen of the land and so if any man should fancy he cared to kiss me he could do so under the pretext that i had pulled my dress from under his feet that will justify them and if we decline their visits they can insult us under the plea of a prior affront oh gibbes george jimmy never did we need your protection as sorely as now and not to know even whether you are alive when charlie joins the army we will be defenseless indeed come to my bosom o my discarded carvingknife laid aside under the impression that these men were gentlemen we will be close friends once more and if you must have a sheath perhaps i may find one for you in the heart of the first man who attempts to butlerize me i never dreamed of kissing any man save my father and brothers and why any one should care to kiss any one else i fail to understand and i do not propose to learn to make exceptions still no word from the boys we hear that norfolk has been evacuated but no details george was there gibbes is wherever johnston is presumably on the rappahannock but it is more than six weeks since we have heard from either of them and all communication is cut off i have had such a search for shoes this week that i am disgusted with shopping i am triumphant now for after traversing the town in every direction and finding nothing i finally discovered a pair of boots just made for a little negro to go fishing with and only an inch and a half too long for me besides being unbendable but i seized them with avidity and the little negro would have been outbid if i had not soon after discovered a pair more seemly if not more serviceable which i took without further difficulty behold my tender feet cased in crocodile skin patentleather tipped lowquarter boys shoes no 2 what a fall was there my country from my pretty english glovekid to sabots made of some animal closely connected with the hippopotamus a dernier ressort vraiment for my choice was that or cooling my feet on the burning pavement au naturel i who have such a terror of any one seeing my naked foot and this is thanks to war and blockade not a decent shoe in the whole community nimporte better days are coming well all have shoes after a while perhaps why did not mark tapley leave me a song calculated to keep the spirits up under depressing circumstances i need one very much and have nothing more suggestive than the old methodist hymn better days are coming well all go right which i shout so constantly as our prospects darken that it begins to sound stale the cry is ho for greenwell very probably this day week will see us there i dont want to go if we were at peace and were to spend a few months of the warmest season out there none would be more eager and delighted than i but to leave our comfortable home and all it contains for a rough pine cottage seventeen miles away even from this scanty civilization is sad it must be we are hourly expecting two regiments of yankees to occupy the garrison and some fifteen hundred of our men are awaiting them a little way off so the fight seems inevitable and we must go leaving what little has already been spared us to the tender mercies of northern volunteers who from the specimen of plundering they gave us two weeks ago will hardly leave us even the shelter of our roof o my dear home how can i help but cry at leaving you forever for if this fight occurs never again shall i pass the threshold of this house where we have been so happy and sad the scene of joyous meetings and mournful partings the place where we greeted each other with glad shouts after even so short a parting the place where harry and father kissed us goodbye and never came back again i know what lavinia has suffered this long year by what we have suffered these last six weeks poor lavinia so far away how easier poverty if it must come would be if we could bear it together i wonder if the real fate of the boys if we ever hear can be so dreadful as this suspense still no news of them my poor little jimmy and think how desperate gibbes and george will be when they read butlers proclamation and they not able to defend us gibbes was in our late victory of fredericksburg i know in other days going to greenwell was the signal for general noise and confusion all the boys gathered their guns and fishingtackle and thousand and one amusements father sent out provisions we helped mother pack hal and i tumbled over the libraries to lay in a supply of reading material and all was bustle until the carriage drove to the door at daylight one morning and swept us off it is not so gay this time i wandered around this morning selecting books alone we can only take what is necessary the rest being left to the care of the northern militia in general i never knew before how many articles were perfectly indispensable to me this or that little token or keepsake piles of letters i hate to burn many dresses etc i cannot take conveniently lie around me and i hardly know which to choose among them yet half must be sacrificed i can only take one trunk after all our trials and tribulations here we are at last and no limbs lost how many weeks ago was it since i wrote here it seems very long after all these events let me try to recall them wednesday the 28th a day to be forever remembered as luck would have it we rose very early and had breakfast sooner than usual it would seem for the express design of becoming famished before dinner i picked up some of my letters and papers and set them where i could find them whenever we were ready to go to greenwell burning a pile of trash and leaving a quantity equally worthless which were of no value even to myself except from association i was packing up my travelingdesk with all harrys little articles that were left to me and other things and i was saying to myself that my affairs were in such confusion that if obliged to run unexpectedly i would not know what to save when i heard lillys voice downstairs crying as she ran in she had been out shopping mr castle has killed a federal officer on a ship and they are going to shell bang went a cannon at the word and that was all our warning mother had just come in and was lying down but sprang to her feet and added her screams to the general confusion miriam who had been searching the libraries ran up to quiet her lilly gathered her children crying hysterically all the time and ran to the front door with them as they were lucy saved the baby naked as she took her from her bath only throwing a quilt over her i bethought me of my runningbag which i had used on a former case and in a moment my few precious articles were secured under my hoops and with a sunbonnet on i stood ready for anything the firing still continued they must have fired half a dozen times before we could coax mother off what awful screams i had hoped never to hear them again after harry died charlie had gone to greenwell before daybreak to prepare the house so we four women with all those children and servants were left to save ourselves i did not forget my poor little jimmy i caught up his cage and ran down just at this moment mother recovered enough to insist on saving fathers papers which was impossible as she had not an idea of where the important ones were i heard miriam plead argue insist command her to run lilly shriek and cry she should go the children screaming within women running by without crying and moaning but i could not join in i was going i knew not where it was impossible to take my bird for even if i could carry him he would starve so i took him out of his cage kissed his little yellow head and tossed him up he gave one feeble little chirp as if to ascertain where to go and then for the first and last time i cried laying my head against the gatepost and with my eyes too dim to see him oh how it hurt me to lose my little bird one jimmy had given me too but the next minute we were all off in safety a square from home i discovered that boy shoes were not the most comfortable things to run in so i ran back in spite of cannonading entreaties etc to get another pair i got home found an old pair that were by no means respectable which i seized without hesitation and being perfectly at ease thought it would be so nice to save at least miriams and my toothbrushes so slipped them in my corsets these in of course we must have a comb that was added then how could we stand the sun without starch to cool our faces this included the powderbag then i must save that beautiful lace collar and my hair was tumbling down so in went the tuckingcomb and hairpins with the rest until if there had been any one to speculate they would have wondered a long while at the singular appearance of a girl who is considered as very slight usually by this time miriam alarmed for me returned to find me though urged by dr castleton not to risk her life by attempting it and we started off together we had hardly gone a square when we decided to return a second time and get at least a few articles for the children and ourselves who had nothing except what we happened to have on when the shelling commenced she picked up any little things and threw them to me while i filled a pillowcase jerked from the bed and placed my powder and brushes in it with the rest before we could leave mother alarmed for us both came to find us with tiche all this time they had been shelling but there was quite a lull when she got there and she commenced picking up fathers papers vowing all the time she would not leave every argument we could use was of no avail and we were desperate as to what course to pursue when the shelling recommenced in a few minutes then mother recommenced her screaming and was ready to fly anywhere and holding her box of papers with a faint idea of saving something she picked up two dirty underskirts and an old cloak by dint of miriams vehement appeals aided by a great deal of pulling we got her down to the back door we had given our pillowcase to tiche who added another bundle and all our silver to it and had already departed as we stood in the door four or five shells sailed over our heads at the same time seeming to make a perfect corkscrew of the air for it sounded as though it went in circles miriam cried never mind the door mother screamed anew and i stayed behind to lock the door with this new music in my ears we reached the back gate that was on the street when another shell passed us and miriam jumped behind the fence for protection we had only gone half a square when dr castleton begged us to take another street as they were firing up that one we took his advice but found our new street worse than the old for the shells seemed to whistle their strange songs with redoubled vigor the height of my ambition was now attained i had heard jimmy laugh about the singular sensation produced by the rifled balls spinning around ones head and here i heard the same peculiar sound ran the same risk and was equal to the rest of the boys for was i not in the midst of flying shells in the middle of a bombardment i think i was rather proud of it we were alone on the road all had run away before so i thought it was for our especial entertainment this little affair i cannot remember how long it lasted i am positive that the clock struck ten before i left home but i had been up so long i know not what time it began though i am told it was between eight and nine we passed the graveyard we did not even stop and about a mile and a half from home when mother was perfectly exhausted with fatigue and unable to proceed farther we met a gentleman in a buggy who kindly took charge of her and our bundles we could have walked miles beyond then for as soon as she was safe we felt as though a load had been removed from our shoulders and after exhorting her not to be uneasy about us and reminding her we had a pistol and a dagger i had secured a for true one the day before fortunately she drove off and we trudged on alone the only people in sight on foot though occasionally carriages and buggies would pass going towards town one party of gentlemen put their heads out and one said there are judge morgans daughters sitting by the road but i observed he did not offer them the slightest assistance however others were very kind one i never heard of had volunteered to go for us and bring us to mother when she was uneasy about our staying so long when we went home to get clothes we heard him ring and knock but thinking it must be next door paid no attention so he went back and mother came herself we were two miles away when we sat down by the road to rest and have a laugh here were two women married and able to take care of themselves flying for their lives and leaving two lorn girls alone on the road to protect each other to be sure neither could help us and one was not able to walk and the other had helpless children to save but it was so funny when we talked about it and thought how sorry both would be when they regained their reason while we were yet resting we saw a cart coming and giving up all idea of our walking to greenwell called the people to stop to our great delight it proved to be a cart loaded with mrs brunots affairs driven by two of her negroes who kindly took us up with them on the top of their luggage and we drove off in state as much pleased at riding in that novel place as though we were accustomed to ride in wheelbarrows miriam was in a hollow between a flour barrel and a mattress and i at the end astride i am afraid of a tremendous bundle for my face was down the road and each foot resting very near the sides of the cart i tried to make a better arrangement though after a while these servants were good enough to lend us their umbrella without which i am afraid we would have suffered severely for the day was intensely warm three miles from town we began to overtake the fugitives hundreds of women and children were walking along some bareheaded and in all costumes little girls of twelve and fourteen were wandering on alone i called to one i knew and asked where her mother was she did nt know she would walk on until she found out it seems her mother lost a nursing baby too which was not found until ten that night white and black were all mixed together and were as confidential as though related all called to us and asked where we were going and many we knew laughed at us for riding on a cart but as they had walked only five miles i imagined they would like even these poor accommodations if they were in their reach the negroes deserve the greatest praise for their conduct hundreds were walking with babies or bundles ask them what they had saved it was invariably my mistresss clothes or silver or baby ask what they had for themselves it was bless your heart honey i was glad to get away with mistresss things i did nt think bout mine it was a heartrending scene women searching for their babies along the road where they had been lost others sitting in the dust crying and wringing their hands for by this time we had not an idea but what baton rouge was either in ashes or being plundered and we had saved nothing i had one dress miriam two but tiche had them and we had lost her before we left home presently we came on a guerrilla camp men and horses were resting on each side of the road some sick some moving about carrying water to the women and children and all looking like a monster barbecue for as far as the eye could see through the woods was the same repetition of men and horses they would ask for the news and one drunk with excitement or whiskey informed us that it was our own fault if we had saved nothing the people must have been fools not to have known trouble would come before long and that it was the fault of the men who were aware of it that the women were thus forced to fly in vain we pleaded that there was no warning no means of foreseeing this he cried you are ruined so am i and my brothers too and by there is nothing left but to die now and ill die good i said but die fighting for us he waved his hand black with powder and shouted that i will after us that was the only swearing guerrilla we met the others seemed to have too much respect for us to talk loud lucy had met us before this early in the action lilly had sent her back to get some babyclothes but a shell exploding within a few feet of her she took alarm and ran up another road for three miles when she cut across the plantations and regained the greenwell route it is fortunate that without consultation the thought of running here should have seized us all i was interrupted so frequently yesterday that i know not how i continued to write so much first i was sent for to go to mrs brunot who had just heard of her sons death and who was alone with dena and some hours after i was sent for to see fanny now mrs trezevant who had just come with her husband to bring us news of george a mrs montgomery who saw him every day at norfolk said jimmy was with him and though very sick at first was now in good health the first news in all that long time when the city was evacuated george went with his regiment seven miles from richmond jimmy to the city itself as aide to com hollins this lady brought georges opal ring and diamond pin howell and mr badger who had just joined the guerrillas as independents spent the day with me we were all in such confusion that i felt ashamed every one as dirty as possible i had on the same dress i had escaped in which though then perfectly clean was now rather dirty but they knew what a time we had had to return to my journal lucy met mother some long way ahead of us whose conscience was already reproaching her for leaving us and in answer to her what has become of my poor girls ran down the road to find us for lucy thinks the world cant keep on moving without us when she met us she walked by the cart and it was with difficulty we persuaded her to ride a mile she said she felt used to walking now about five miles from home we overtook mother the gentleman had been obliged to go for his wife so mary gave her her seat on the cart and walked with lucy three miles beyond where we heard that lilly and the children had arrived in a cart early in the day all the talk by the roadside was of burning homes houses knocked to pieces by balls famine murder desolation so i comforted myself singing better days are coming and i hope to die shouting the lord will provide while lucy toiled through the sun and dust and answered with a chorus of im arunnin arunnin up to glory it was three oclock when we reached mr davids and found lilly how warm and tired we were a hasty meal which tasted like a feast after our fatigue gave us fresh strength and lilly and miriam got in an old cart with the children to drive out here leaving me with mother and dellie to follow next day about sunset charlie came flying down the road on his way to town i decided to go and after an obstinate debate with mother in which i am afraid i showed more determination than amiability i wrung a reluctant consent from her and promising not to enter if it was being fired or plundered drove off in triumph it was a desperate enterprise for a young girl to enter a town full of soldiers on such an expedition at night but i knew charlie could take care of me and if he was killed i could take care of myself so i went it was long after nine when we got there and my first act was to look around the deserted house what a scene of confusion armoirs spread open with clothes tumbled in every direction inside and out ribbons laces on floors chairs overturned my desk wide open covered with letters trinkets etc bureau drawers half out the bed filled with odds and ends of everything i no longer recognized my little room on the bolster was a little box at the sight of which i burst out laughing five minutes before the alarm miriam had been selecting those articles she meant to take to greenwell and holding up her box said if we were forced to run for our lives without a moments warning i d risk my life to save this rather than leave it yet here lay the box and she was safe at greenwell it took me two hours to pack fathers papers then i packed miriams trunk then some of mothers and mine listening all the while for a cannon for men were constantly tramping past the house and only on condition our guerrillas did not disturb them had they promised not to recommence the shelling charlie went out to hear the news and i packed alone it seems the only thing that saved the town was two gentlemen who rowed out to the ships and informed the illustrious commander that there were no men there to be hurt and he was only killing women and children the answer was he was sorry he had hurt them he thought of course the town had been evacuated before the men were fools enough to fire on them and had only shelled the principal streets to intimidate the people these streets were the very ones crowded with flying women and children which they must have seen with their own eyes for those lying parallel to the river led to the garrison at one end and the crevasse at the other which cut off all the lower roads so that the streets he shelled were the only ones that the women could follow unless they wished to be drowned as for the firing four guerrillas were rash enough to fire on a yawl which was about to land without a flag of truce killing one wounding three one of whom afterwards died they were the only ones in town there was not a cannon in our hands even if a dozen men could be collected and this cannonading was kept up in return for half a dozen shots from as many rifles without even a show of resistance after so ended the momentous shelling of baton rouge during which the valiant farragut killed one whole woman wounded three struck some twenty houses several times apiece and indirectly caused the death of two little children who were drowned in their flight one poor little baby that was born in the woods and several cases of the same kind besides those who will yet die from the fatigue as mrs w d phillips who had not left her room since january who was carried out in her nightgown and is now supposed to be in a dying condition the man who took mother told us he had taken a dying woman in the act of expiring in his buggy from her bed and had left her a little way off where she had probably breathed her last a few moments after there were many similar cases hurrah for the illustrious farragut the woman killer it was three oclock before i left off packing and took refuge in a tub of cold water from the dust and heat of the morning what a luxury the water was and when i changed my underclothes i felt like a new being to be sure i pulled off the skin of my heel entirely where it had been blistered by the walk dust sun etc but that was a trifle though still quite sore now for three hours i dreamed of rifled shells and battles and at halfpast six i was up and at work again mother came soon after and after hard work we got safely off at three saving nothing but our clothes and silver all else is gone it cost me a pang to leave my guitar and miriams piano but it seems there was no help for it so i had to submit it was dark night when we reached here a bright fire was blazing in front but the house looked so desolate that i wanted to cry miriam cried when i told her her piano was left behind supper was a new sensation after having been without anything except a glass of clabber no saucers and a piece of bread since halfpast six i laid down on the hard floor to rest my weary bones thankful that i was so fortunate as to be able to lie down at all in my dozing state i heard the wagon come and miriam ordering a mattress to be put in the room for me i could make out very well you may take that one to miss eliza but the next one shall be brought to miss sarah poor miriam she is always fighting my battles she and the servants are always taking my part against the rest of the world she and lucy made a bed and rolled me in it with no more questions and left me with damp eyes at the thought of how good and tender every one is to me poor lucy picked me a dish of blackberries to await my arrival and i was just as grateful for it though they were eaten by some one else before i came early yesterday morning miriam nettie and sophie who did not then know of their brothers death went to town in a cart determined to save some things miriam to save her piano as soon as they were halfway news reached us that any one was allowed to enter but none allowed to leave the town and all vehicles confiscated as soon as they reached there alarmed for their safety mother started off to find them and we have heard of none of them since what will happen next i am not uneasy they dare not harm them it is glorious to shell a town full of women but to kill four lone ones is not exciting enough from the news brought by one or two persons who managed to reach here yesterday i am more uneasy about mother and the girls a gentleman tells me that no one is permitted to leave without a pass and of these only such as are separated from their families who may have left before all families are prohibited to leave and furniture and other valuables also here is an agreeable arrangement i saw the pass just such as we give our negroes signed by a wisconsin colonel think of being obliged to ask permission from some low plowman to go in or out of our own house cannon are planted as far out as colonel davidsons six of them at our graveyard and one or more on all the other roads if the guerrillas do not attempt their capture i shall take it upon myself to suggest it to the very next one i see even if they cannot use them it will frighten the yankees who are in a state of constant alarm about them their reason for keeping people in town is that they hope they will not be attacked so long as our own friends remain thereby placing us above themselves in the scale of humanity since they acknowledge we are not brute enough to kill women and children as they did not hesitate to do farragut pleads that he could not restrain his men they were so enraged when the order was once given to fire and says they would strike a few houses though he ordered them to fire solely at horses and the clouds of dust in the street where guerrillas were supposed to be the dust was by no means thick enough to conceal that these guerrillas were women carrying babies instead of guns and the horses were drawing buggies in which many a sick woman was lying a young lady who applied to the yankee general for a pass to come out here having doubtless spoken of the number of women here who had fled and the position of the place was advised to remain in town and write to the ladies to return immediately and assure them that they would be respected and protected etc but that it was madness to remain at greenwell for a terrific battle would be fought there in a few days and they would be exposed to the greatest danger the girl wrote the letter but mr fox we are not quite such fools as to return there to afford you the protection our petticoats would secure to you thereby preventing you from receiving condign punishment for the injuries and loss of property already inflicted upon us by you no we remain here and if you are not laid low before you pass the comite bridge we can take to the woods again and camp out as many a poor woman is doing now a few miles from town many citizens have been arrested and after being confined a while and closely questioned have been released if the information is satisfactory a negro man is informing on all cotton burners and violent secessionists etc the girls have just got back riding in a mule team on top of baggage but without either mother or any of our affairs our condition is perfectly desperate miriam had an interview with general williams which was by no means satisfactory he gave her a pass to leave and bring us back for he says there is no safety here for us he will restrain his men in town and protect the women but once outside he will answer neither for his men nor the women and children as soon as he gets horses enough he passes this road going to camp moore with his cavalry and then we are in greater danger than ever any house shut up shall be occupied by soldiers five thousand are there now five more expected what shall we do mother remained sending miriam for me determined to keep us there rather than sacrifice both our lives and property by remaining here but then two weeks from now the yellow fever will break out mother has the greatest horror of it and we have never had it dying is not much in the present state of our affairs but the survivor will suffer even more than we do now if we stay how shall we live i have seventeen hundred dollars in confederate notes now in my runningbag and three or four in silver the former will not be received there the latter might last two days if we save our house and furniture it is at the price of starving i am of opinion that we should send for mother and with what money we have make our way somewhere in the interior to some city where we can communicate with the boys and be advised by them this is not living home is lost beyond all hope of recovery if we wait what we have already saved will go too so we had better leave at once with what clothing we have which will certainly establish us on the footing of ladies if we chance to fall among vulgar people who never look beyond i fear the guerrillas will attack the town tonight if they do god help mother general williams offered miriam an escort when he found she was without a protector in the most fatherly way he must be a good man she thanked him but said she felt perfectly safe on that road he bit his lip understanding the allusion and did not insist she was to deliver a message from parties in town to the first guerrillas they met concerning the safest roads and presently six met them and entered into conversation she told them of the proffered escort when one sprang forward crying why did nt you accept miss the next time ask for one and if it is at all disagreeable to you i am the very man to rid you of such an inconvenience ill see that you are not annoyed long i am glad it was not sent she would have reproached herself with murder forever after i wonder if the general would have risked it well day before yesterday i almost vowed i would not return and last evening i reached here verily consistency thou art a jewel i determined to get to town to lay both sides of the question before mother saving home and property by remaining thereby cutting ourselves off forever from the boys and dying of yellow fever or flying to mississippi losing all save our lives so as mrs brunot was panicstricken and determined to die in town rather than be starved at greenwell and was going in on the same wagon that came out the night before i got up with her and nettie and left greenwell at ten yesterday morning bringing nothing except this old book which i would rather not lose as it has been an old and kind friend during these days of trouble at first i avoided all mention of political affairs but now there is nothing else to be thought of if it is not burnt for treason i will like to look it over some day if i live i left greenwell without ever looking around it beyond one walk to the hotel so i may say i hardly know what it looks like miriam stayed much against her will i fear to bring in our trunks if i could send a wagon a guerrilla picket stopped us before we had gone a mile and seemed disposed to turn us back we said we must pass our all was at stake they then entreated us not to enter saying it was not safe i asked if they meant to burn it we will help try it was the answer i begged them to delay the experiment until we could get away one waved his hat to me and said he would fight for me hope he will at a distance they asked if we had no protectors none we said dont go then and they all looked so sorry for us we said we must starvation and another panic awaited us out there our brothers were fighting our fathers dead we had only our own judgment to rely on and that told us home was the best place for us if the town must burn let us burn in our houses rather than be murdered in the woods they looked still more sorry but still begged us not to remain we would though and one young boy called out as we drove off whats the name of that young lady who refused the escort i told him and they too expressed the greatest regret that she had not accepted we met many on the road nearly all of whom talked to us and as they were most respectful in their manner though they saw us in a mule team we gave them all the information we could which was all news to them though very little such a ride in the hot sun perched up in the air one of the servants remarked miss sarah aint ashamed to ride in a wagon with truth i replied no i was never so high before two miles from home we met the first federal pickets and then they grew more numerous until we came on a large camp near our graveyard filled with soldiers and cannon from first to last none refrained from laughing at us not aloud but they would grin and be inwardly convulsed with laughter as we passed one laughed so comically that i dropped my veil hastily for fear he would see me smile i could not help it if any one smiled at me while i was dying i believe i would return it we passed crowds for it was now five oclock and all seemed to be promenading there were several officers standing at the corner near our house who were very much amused at our vehicle i did not feel like smiling then after reducing us to riding in a mule team they were heartless enough to laugh i forgot them presently and gave my whole attention to getting out respectably now getting in a wagon is bad enough but getting out i hardly know how i managed it i had fully three feet to step down before reaching the wheel once there the driver picked me up and set me on the pavement the net i had gathered my hair in fell in my descent and my hair swept down halfway between my knee and ankle in one stream as i turned to get my little bundle the officers had moved their position to one directly opposite to me where they could examine me at leisure queens used to ride drawn by oxen hundreds of years ago so i played this was old times the mules were oxen i a queen and stalked off in a style i am satisfied would have imposed on juno herself when i saw them as i turned they were perfectly quiet but nettie says up to that moment they had been in convulsions of laughter with their handkerchiefs to their faces it was not polite i found mother safe but the house was in the most horrible confusion jimmys empty cage stood by the door it had the same effect on me that empty coffins produce on others oh my birdie at six i could no longer stand my hunger i had fasted for twelve hours with the exception of a mouthful of hoecake at eleven i that never fasted in my life except last ash wednesday when lydia and i tried it for breakfast and got so sick we were glad to atone for it at dinner so i got a little piece of bread and corn beef from mrs daigres servant for there was not a morsel here and i did not know where or what to buy presently some kind friend sent me a great shortcake a dish of strawberry preserves and some butter which i was grateful for for the fact that the old negro was giving me part of her supper made me rather sparing though she cried eat it all honey i get plenty more mother went to cousin wills and i went to mrs brunots to sleep and so ended my first days ride on a mule team bah a lady can make anything respectable by the way she does it what do i care if i had been driving mules better that than walk seventeen miles i met dr duchne and dr castleton twice each this morning they were as kind to me as they were to the girls the other day the latter saved them a disagreeable visit while here he and those three were packing some things in the hall when two officers passed and prepared to come in seeing three goodlooking girls seemingly alone for miriams dress hid dr castleton as he leaned over the box just then she moved the doctor raised his head and the officers started back with an ah of surprise the doctor called them as they turned away and asked for a pass for the young ladies they came back bowing and smiling said they would write one in the house but they were told very dryly that there were no writing accommodations there they tried the fascinating and were much mortified by the coldness they met dear me why was nt i born old and ugly suppose i should unconsciously entrap some magnificent yankee what an awful thing it would be sentinels are stationed at every corner dr castleton piloted me safely through one expedition but on the next we had to part company and i passed through a crowd of at least fifty alone they were playing cards in the ditch and swearing dreadfully these pious yankees many were marching up and down some sleeping on the pavement others picking odious bugs out of each others heads i thought of the guerrillas yellow fever and all and wished they were all safe at home with their mothers and sisters and we at peace again what a day i have had here mother and i are alone not a servant on the lot we will sleep here tonight and i know she will be too nervous to let me sleep the dirt and confusion were extraordinary in the house i could not stand it so i applied myself to making it better i actually swept two whole rooms i ruined my hands at gardening so it made no difference i replaced piles of books crockery china that miriam had left packed for greenwell i discovered i could empty a dirty hearth dust move heavy weights make myself generally useful and dirty and all this is thanks to the yankees poor me this time last year i thought i would never walk again if i am not laid up forever after the fatigue of this last week i shall always maintain i have a constitution but it all seems nothing in this confusion everything is almost as bad as ever besides that i have been flying around to get miriam a wagon i know she is half distracted at being there alone mother chose staying with all its evils charlies life would pay the penalty of a cotton burner if he returned so lilly remains at greenwell with him we three will get on as best we can here i wrote to the country to get a wagon sent a pass from headquarters but i will never know if it reached her until i see her in town i hope it will i would be better satisfied with miriam miriam and mattie drove in in the little buggy last evening after sunset to find out what we were to do our condition is desperate beauregard is about attacking these federals they say he is coming from corinth and the fight will be in town if true we are lost again starvation at greenwell fever and bullets here will put an end to us soon enough there is no refuge for us no one to consult brother whose judgment we rely on as implicitly as we did on fathers we hear has gone to new york there is no one to advise or direct us for if he is gone there is no man in louisiana whose decision i would blindly abide by let us stay and die we can only die once we can suffer a thousand deaths with suspense and uncertainty the shortest is the best do you think the few words here can give an idea of our agony and despair nothing can express it i feel a thousand years old today i have shed the bitterest tears today that i have shed since father died i cant stand it much longer ill give way presently and i know my heart will break shame where is god a fig for your religion if it only lasts while the sun shines better days are coming i cant troops are constantly passing and repassing they have scoured the country for ten miles out in search of guerrillas we are here without servants clothing or the bare necessaries of life suppose they should seize them on the way i procured a pass for the wagon but it now seems doubtful if i can get the latter a very faint chance well let them go our home next then we can die sure enough with gods help i can stand anything yet in store for me i hope to die shouting the lord will provide poor lavinia if she could only see us i am glad she does not know our condition what a day of agony doubt uncertainty and despair heaven save me from another such every hour fresh difficulties arose until i believe we were almost crazy every one of us as miriam was about stepping in the buggy to go to greenwell to bring in our trunks mothers heart misgave her and she decided to sacrifice her properly rather than remain in this state any longer after a desperate discussion which proved that each argument was death she decided to go back to greenwell and give up the keys of the house to general williams and let him do as he pleased rather than have it broken open during her absence mattie and mr tunnard were present at the discussion which ended by the latter stepping in the buggy and driving miriam to the garrison general williams called her by name and asked her about major drum it seems all these people native and foreign know us while we know none miriam told him our condition how our brothers were away father dead and mother afraid to remain yet unwilling to lose her property by going away how we three were alone and unprotected here but would remain rather than have our home confiscated he assured her the house should not be touched that it would be respected in our absence as though we were in it and he would place a sentinel at the door to guard it against his own men who might be disposed to enter the latter she declined but he said he would send his aide to mark the house that it might be known a moment after they got back the aide mr biddle i have his name to so many passes that i know it now came to the door mr tunnard left him there uncertain how we would receive a christian and i went out and asked him in he looked uncertain of his reception too when we put an end to his doubt by treating him as we invariably treat gentlemen who appear such he behaved remarkably well under the trying circumstances and insisted on a sentinel for he said though they would respect the property there were many bad characters among the soldiers who might attempt to rob it and the sentinel would protect it after a visit of ten minutes devoted exclusively to the affair he arose and took his leave leaving me under the impression that he was a gentleman wherever he came from even if there were a few grammatical errors in the pass he wrote me yesterday but thou that judgest another dost thou sin well now we say fly to greenwell yes and by tonight a most exaggerated account of the whole affair will be spread over the whole country and we will be equally suspected by our own people those who spread useless falsehoods about us will gladly have a foundation for a monstrous one did nt camp moore ring with the story of our entertaining the federal officers did nt they spread the report that miriam danced with one to the tune of yankee doodle in the state house garden what will they stop at now o if i was only a man and knew what to do we were so distressed by the false position in which we would be placed by a federal sentinel that we did not know what course to pursue as all our friends shook their heads and said it was dangerous we knew full well what our enemies would say if we win baton rouge as i pray we will they will say we asked protection from yankees against our own men are consequently traitors and our property will be confiscated by our own government to decline general williamss kind offer exposes the house to being plundered in our dilemma we made up our minds to stay so we could say the sentinel was unnecessary presently a file of six soldiers marched to the gate an officer came to the steps and introduced himself as colonel mcmillan of 21st indiana volunteers he asked if this was mrs morgans the general had ordered a guard placed around the house he would suggest placing them in different parts of the yard madam the pickets await your orders miriam in a desperate fright undertook to speak for mother and asked if he thought there was any necessity no but it was an additional security he said then if no actual necessity we will relieve you of the disagreeable duty as we expect to remain in town she said he was very kind and discussed the whole affair with us saying when we made up our minds to leave we told him after we could not decide to write him word and he would place a guard around to prevent his men and the negroes from breaking in it was a singular situation our brothers off fighting them while these federal officers leaned over our fence and an officer standing on our steps offered to protect us these people are certainly very kind to us general williams especially must be a dear old gentleman he is so good how many good and how many mean people these troubles have shown us i am beginning to see my true friends now there is a large number of them too everybody from whom we least expected attention has agreeably surprised us general williams will believe we are insane from our changing so often his guard positively refused last night i determined to stay miriam went after our trunks at daylight a few hours after lilly wrote we must go back mcclellans army was cut to pieces and driven back to maryland by jackson the federals were being driven into the swamp from richmond too beauregard is undoubtedly coming to attack baton rouge his fire would burn the town if the gunboats do not the yankees will shell at all events if forced to retire it cannot stand we cant go to new orleans butler says he will lay it in ashes if he is forced to evacuate it from yellow fever or other causes both must be burned greenwell is not worth the powder it would cost so we must stand the chance of murder and starvation there rather than the certainty of being placed between two fires here well i see nothing but bloodshed and beggary staring us in the face let it come i hope to die shouting the lord will provide we dined at mrs brunots yesterday and sitting on the gallery later had the full benefit of a yankee drill they stopped in front of the house and went through some very curious manoeuvres and then marched out to their drillground beyond in returning the whole regiment drew up directly before us and we were dreadfully quiet for five minutes the most uncomfortable i have experienced for some time for it was absurd to look at the sky and i looked in vain for one man with downcast eyes whereon i might rest mine but from the officers down to the last private they were all looking at us i believe i would have cried with embarrassment if the command had not been given at that moment they drilled splendidly and knew it too so went through it as though they had not been at it for an hour before one conceited redheaded lieutenant smiled at us in the most fascinating way perhaps he smiled to think how fine he was and what an impression he was making we got back to our solitary house before twilight and were sitting on the balcony when mr biddle entered he came to ask if the guard had been placed here last night it seems to me it would have saved him such a long walk if he had asked colonel mcmillan he sat down though and got talking in the moonlight and people passing some citizens some officers looked wonderingly at this unheardof occurrence i wont be rude to any one in my own house yankee or southern say what they will he talked a great deal and was very entertaining what tempted him i cannot imagine it was two hours before he thought of leaving he was certainly very kind he spoke of the scarcity of flour in town said they had quantities at the garrison and asked permission to send us a barrel which of course we refused it showed a very good heart though he offered to take charge of any letters i would write said he had heard general williams speak of harry and when he at last left i was still more pleased with him for this kindness to us he says captain huger is dead i am very very much distressed they are related he says he talked so reasonably of the war that it was quite a novelty after reading the abusive newspapers of both sides i like him and was sorry i could not ask him to repeat his visit we are unaccustomed to treat gentlemen that way but it wont do in the present state to act as we please mob governs mother kept me awake all night to listen to the mice in the garret every time i would doze she would ask whats that and insist that the mice were men i had to get up and look for an imaginary host so i am tired enough this morning miriam has just got in with all the servants our baggage is on the way so we will be obliged to stay whether we will or no i dont care it is all the same starve or burn oh i forgot mr biddle did not write that pass it was his clerk he speaks very grammatically so far as i can judge these people mean to kill us with kindness there is such a thing as being too kind yesterday general williams sent a barrel of flour to mother accompanied by a note begging her to accept it in consideration of the present condition of the circulating currency and the intention was so kind the way it was done so delicate that there was no refusing it i had to write her thanks and got in a violent fit of the trembles at the idea of writing to a stranger one consolation is that i am not a very big fool for it took only three lines to prove myself one if i had been a thundering big one i would have occupied two pages to show myself fully and to think it is out of our power to prove them our appreciation of the kindness we have universally met with many officers were in church this morning and as they passed us while we waited for the door to be opened general williams bowed profoundly another followed his example we returned the salute of course but by tomorrow those he did not bow to will cry treason against us let them howl i am tired of lies scandal and deceit all the loudest gossips have been frightened into the country but enough remain to keep them well supplied with town talk it is such a consolation to turn to the dear good people of the world after coming in contact with such cattle here for instance is mr bonnecase on whom we have not the slightest claims every day since we have been here he has sent a great pitcher of milk knowing our cow is out one day he sent rice the next sardines yesterday two bottles of port and madeira which cannot be purchased in the whole south what a duck of an old man that is only one instance this morning while i was attending to my flowers several soldiers stopped in front of me and holding on the fence commenced to talk about some brave colonel and a shooting affair last night when all had gone except one who was watching me attentively as he seemed to wish to tell me i let him go ahead the story was that colonel mcmillan was shot through the shoulder breast and liver by three guerrillas while four miles from town last night on a scout he was a quarter of a mile from his own men at the time killed one who shot him took the other two prisoners and fell from his horse himself when he got within the lines the soldier said these two guerrillas would probably be hanged while the six we saw pass captives sunday would probably be sent to fort jackson for life i think the guerrilla affair mere murder i confess but what a dreadful fate for these young men one who passed sunday was jimmys schoolmate a boy of sixteen another willie garig the pet of a whole family of good honest country people these soldiers will get in the habit of talking to me after a while through my own fault yesterday i could not resist the temptation to ask the fate of the six guerrillas and stopped two volunteers who were going by to ask them they discussed the fate of the country told me fort pillow and vicksburg were evacuated the mississippi opened from source to mouth i told them of bankss and mcclellans defeat they assured me it would all be over in a month which i fervently prey may be so told me they were from michigan one was mr bee he laid cousin of our general and they would probably have talked all day if i had not bowed myself away with thanks for their information it made me ashamed to contrast the quiet gentlemanly liberal way these volunteers spoke of us and our cause with the rabid fanatical abusive violence of our own female secession declaimers thank heaven i have never yet made my appearance as a billingsgate orator on these occasions all my violent feelings which in moments of intense excitement were really violent i have recorded in this book i am happy to say only the reasonable dislike to seeing my country subjugated has been confided to the public ear when necessary and that even now i confess that nothing but the reign of terror and gross prejudice by which i was surrounded at that time could justify many expressions i have here applied to them fact is these people have disarmed me by their kindness i expected to be in a crowd of ruffian soldiers who would think nothing of cutting your throat or doing anything they felt like and i find among all these thousands not one who offers the slightest annoyance or disrespect the former is the thing as it is believed by the whole country the latter the true state of affairs i admire foes who show so much consideration for our feelings contrast these with our volunteers from new orleans all gentlemen who came to take the garrison from major haskins several of them passing our gate where we were standing with the brunots one exclaimed what pretty girls it was a stage aside that we were supposed not to hear yes said another beautiful but they look as though they could be fast fast and we were not even speaking not even looking at them sophie and i were walking presently and met half a dozen we had to stop to let them pass the crossing they did not think of making way for us no 1 sighed such a sigh no 2 followed and so on when they all sighed in chorus for our edification while we dared not raise our eyes from the ground that is the time i would have made use of a dagger two passed in a buggy and trusting to our not recognizing them from the rapidity of their vehicle kissed their hands to us until they were out of sight all went back to new orleans vowing baton rouge had the prettiest girls in the world these were our own people the lite of new orleans loyal southerners and gentlemen these northerners pass us satisfied with a simple glance some take off their hats for all these officers know our name though we may not know theirs how i cant say when i heard of colonel mcmillans misfortune mother conspired with me to send over some bandages and something tiche manufactured of flour under the name of nourishment for he is across the street at heromans miriam objected on account of what our people will say and what we will suffer for it if the guerrillas reach town but we persuaded her we were right you can imagine our condition at present many years hence sarah when you reflect that it is the brave noblehearted generous miriam who is afraid to do that deed on account of public opinion which indeed is down on us at greenwell they are frantic about our returning to town and call us traitors yankees and vow vengeance a lady said to me the guerrillas have a black list containing the names of those remaining in town all the men are to be hanged their houses burned and all the women are to be tarred and feathered i said madam if i believed them capable of such a vile threat even much less the execution i would see them cut down without a feeling of compassion which is not true and swear i was a yankee rather than claim being a native of the same country with such brutes she has a long tongue when i next hear of it it will be that i told the story and called them brutes and hoped they would be shot etc and so goes the world no one will think of saying that i did not believe them guilty of the thought even our three brothers may be sick or wounded at this minute what i do for this man god will send some one to do for them and with that belief i do it last evening mother and miriam went to the arsenal to see if they would be allowed to do anything for the prisoners general williams received them and fascinated miriam by his manner as usual poor miriam is always being fascinated according to her own account he sent for little nathan castle and willie garig and left them alone in the room with them showing his confidence and delicacy by walking away the poor young men were very grateful to be remembered one had his eyes too full of tears to speak mr garig told miriam that when the story of her refusing the escort was told in camp the woods rang with shouts of three cheers for miss morgan they said they were treated very well and had no want except clean clothes and to let their mothers know they were well and content i have been hard at work mending three or four suits of the boys clothing for those poor young men some needed thread and needle very much but it was the best we could do so i packed them all up not forgetting a row of pins and sent tiche off with the bundle perched real congo fashion on her manycolored headhandkerchief which was tied in the most superb creole style in honor of the occasion my poor old diary comes to a very abrupt end to my great distress the hardest thing in the world is to break off journalizing when you are once accustomed to it and mine has proved such a resource to me in these dark days of trouble that i feel as though i were saying goodbye to an old and tried friend thanks to my liberal supply of pens ink and paper how many inexpressibly dreary days i have filled up to my own satisfaction if not to that of others how many disagreeable affairs it has caused me to pass over without another thought how many times it has proved a relief to me where my tongue was forced to remain quiet without the blessed materials i would have fallen victim to despair and the blues long since but they have kept my eyes fixed on better days acoming while slightly alluding to present woes kept me from making a fool of myself many a day acted as lightning rod to my mental thunder and have made me happy generally for all of which i cry vivent pen ink and paper and add with regret adieu my mental conductor i fear this unchained lightning will strike somewhere in your absence there is no use in trying to break off journalizing particularly in these trying times it has become a necessity to me i believe i should go off in a rapid decline if butler took it in his head to prohibit that among other things i reserve to myself the privilege of writing my opinions since i trouble no one with the expression of them i insist that if the valor and chivalry of our men cannot save our country i would rather have it conquered by a brave race than owe its liberty to the billingsgate oratory and demonstrations of some of these ladies if the women have the upper hand then as they have now i would not like to live in a country governed by such tongues do i consider the female who could spit in a gentlemans face merely because he wore united states buttons as a fit associate for me lieutenant biddle assured me he did not pass a street in new orleans without being most grossly insulted by ladies it was a friend of his into whose face a lady spit as he walked quietly by without looking at her wonder if she did it to attract his attention he had the sense to apply to her husband and give him two minutes to apologize or die and of course he chose the former such things are enough to disgust any one loud women what a contempt i have for you how i despise your vulgarity some of these ultrasecessionists evidently very recently from down east who think themselves obliged to kick up their heels over the bonny blue flag as brother describes female patriotism shriek out what see those vile northerners pass patiently no true southerner could see it without rage i could kill them i hate them with all my soul the murderers liars thieves rascals you are no southerner if you do not hate them as much as i ah a a trueblue yankee tell me that i born and bred here am no southerner i always think it is well for you my friend to save your credit else you might be suspected by some people though your violence is enough for me i always say you may do as you please my brothers are fighting for me and doing their duty so that excess of patriotism is unnecessary for me as my position is too well known to make any demonstrations requisite this war has brought out wicked malignant feelings that i did not believe could dwell in womans heart i see some of the holiest eyes so holy one would think the very spirit of charity lived in them and all christian meekness go off in a mad tirade of abuse and say with the holy eyes wondrously changed i hope god will send down plague yellow fever famine on these vile yankees and that not one will escape death o what unutterable horror that remark causes me as often as i hear it i think of the many mothers wives and sisters who wait as anxiously pray as fervently in their faraway homes for their dear ones as we do here i fancy them waiting day after day for the footsteps that will never come growing more sad lonely and heartbroken as the days wear on i think of how awful it would be if one would say your brothers are dead how it would crush all life and happiness out of me and i say god forgive these poor women they know not what they say o women into what loathsome violence you have abased your holy mission god will punish us for our hardheartedness not a square off in the new theatre lie more than a hundred sick soldiers what woman has stretched out her hand to save them to give them a cup of cold water where is the charity which should ignore nations and creeds and administer help to the indian and heathen indifferently gone all gone in a union versus secession that is what the american war has brought us if i was independent if i could work my own will without causing others to suffer for my deeds i would not be poring over this stupid page i would not be idly reading or sewing i would put aside womans trash take up womans duty and i would stand by some forsaken man and bid him godspeed as he closes his dying eyes that is womans mission and not preaching and politics i say i would yet here i sit o for liberty the liberty that dares do what conscience dictates and scorns all smaller rules if i could help these dying men yet it is as impossible as though i was a chained bear i cant put out my hand i am threatened with coventry because i sent a custard to a sick man who is in the army and with the anathema of society because i said if i could possibly do anything for mr biddle at a distance he is sick i would like to very much charlie thinks we have acted shockingly in helping colonel mcmillan and that we will suffer for it when the federals leave i would like to see any man who dared harm my fathers daughter but as he seems to think our conduct reflects on him there is no alternative die poor men without a womans hand to close your eyes we women are too patriotic to help you i look eagerly on cry in my soul i wish you die god judges me behold the woman who dares not risk private ties for gods glory and her professed religion coward helpless woman that i am if i was free yesterday and day before boats were constantly arriving and troops embarking from here destined for vicksburg there will be another fight and of course it will fall i wish will was out of it i dont want him to die i got the kindest sweetest letter from will when miriam came from greenwell it was given to her by a guerrilla on the road who asked if she was not miss sarah morgan how long o how long is it since i have lain down in peace thinking this night i will rest in safety certainly not since the fall of fort jackson if left to myself i would not anticipate evil but would quietly await the issue of all these dreadful events but when i hear men who certainly should know better than i express their belief that in twentyfour hours the town will be laid in ashes i begin to grow uneasy and think it must be so since they say it these last few days since the news arrived of the intervention of the english and french i have alternately risen and fallen from the depth of despair to the height of delight and expectation as the probability of another exodus diminishes and peace appears more probable if these men would not prophesy the burning of the city i would be perfectly satisfied well i packed up a few articles to satisfy my conscience since these men insist that another run is inevitable though against my own conviction i am afraid i was partly influenced by my dream last night of being shelled out unexpectedly and flying without saving an article it was the same dream i had a night or two before we fled so ingloriously from baton rouge when i dreamed of meeting will pinckney suddenly who greeted me in the most extraordinarily affectionate manner and told me that vicksburg had fallen he said he had been chiefly to blame and the southerners were so incensed at his losing the northerners at his defending that both were determined to hang him he was running for his life he took me to a hill from which i could see the garrison and the american flag flying over it i looked and saw we were standing in blood up to our knees while here and there ghastly white bones shone above the red surface just then below me i saw crowds of people running what is it i asked it means that in another instant they will commence to shell the town save yourself but will i must save some clothes too how can i go among strangers with a single dress i will get some i cried he smiled and said you will run with only what articles you happen to have on bang went the first shell the people rushed by with screams and i awakened to tell miriam what an absurd dream i had had it happened as will had said either that same day or the day after for the change of clothes we saved apiece were given to tiche who lost sight of us and quietly came home when all was over and the two dirty skirts and old cloak mother saved after carrying them a mile and a half i put in the buggy that took her up so i saved nothing except the bag that was tied under my hoops will was right i saved not even my powderbag tiche had it in the bundle my handkerchief i gave mother before we had walked three squares and throughout that long fearfully warm day riding and walking through the fiery sunshine and stifling dust i had neither to cool or comfort me miriam and i have disgraced ourselves this morning i was quietly hearing dellies lessons when i was startled by mothers shrieks of send for a guard theyve murdered him i saw through the window a soldier sitting in the road just opposite with blood streaming from his hand in a great pool in the dust i was downstairs in three bounds and snatching up some water ran to where he sat alone not a creature near though all the inhabitants of our side of the street were looking on from the balconies all crying murder and help without moving themselves i poured some water on the mans bloody hand as he held it streaming with gore up to me saying the man in there did it meaning the one who keeps the little grogshop though it puzzled me at the time to see that all the doors were closed and not a face visible i had hardly time to speak when tiche called loudly to me to come away she was safe at the front gate and looking up i found myself in a knot of a dozen soldiers and took her advice and retreated home it proved to be the guard miriam had roused she ran out as i did and seeing a gentleman begged him to call the guard for that murdered man the individual he must have been a patriot said he did nt know where to find one she cried out they were at heromans he said he did nt believe they were go i tell you she screamed at last but the brave man said he did nt like to so she ran to the corner and called the soldiers herself o most brave man before we got back from our several expeditions we heard mother lilly mrs day all shouting bring in the children lock the doors etc all for a poor wounded soldier we after discovered that the man was drunk and had cursed the woman of the grogshop whereupon her husband had pitched him out in the street where they found him they say he hurt his hand against a post but wood could never have cut deep enough to shed all that gore i dont care if he was drunk or sober soldier or officer federal or confederate if he had been satan himself lying helpless and bleeding in the street i would have gone to him i cant believe it was as criminal as though i had watched quietly from a distance believing him dying and contenting myself with looking on yet it seems it was dreadfully indecorous miriam and i did very wrong we should have shouted murder with the rest of the women and servants whereas the man who declined committing himself by calling one soldier to the rescue of another supposed to be dying acted most discreetly and showed his wisdom in the most striking manner may i never be discreet or wise if this is christian conduct or a sample of either i would rather be a rash impetuous fool charlie says he would not open his mouth to save a dozen from being murdered i say i am not stoic enough for that lilly agrees with him miriam with me so here we two culprits stand alone before the tribunal of patriotism madame roland i take the liberty of altering your words and cry o patriotism how many base deeds are sanctioned by your name dont i wish i was a heathen in twentyfour hours the whole country will be down on us i cant say worse than that yesterday morning just as i stepped out of bed i heard the report of four cannon fired in rapid succession and everybody asked everybody else did you hear that so significantly that i must say my heart beat very rapidly for a few moments at the thought of another stampede at halfpast six this morning i was wakened by another report followed by seven others and heard again the question did you hear that on a higher key than yesterday it did not take me many minutes to get out of bed and to slip on a few articles i confess my chief desire was to wash my face before running if they were actually shelling us again it appears that they were only practicing however and no harm was intended but we are living on such a volcano that not knowing what to expect we are rather nervous i am afraid this close confinement will prove too much for me my long walks are cut off on account of the soldiers one month tomorrow since my last visit to the graveyard that haunts me always it must be so dreary out there here is a sketch of my daily life enough to finish me off forever if much longer persisted in first get up a little before seven after breakfast which is generally within a few minutes after i get down it used to be just as i got ready and sometimes before last winter i attend to my garden which consists of two strips of ground the length of the house in front where i can find an hours work in examining and admiring my flowers replanting those that the cows and horses occasionally once a day pull up for me and in turning the soil over and over again to see which side grows best o my garden abode of rare delights how many pleasant hours i have passed in you armed with scissors knife hoe or rake only pausing when mr this or mr that leaned over the fence to have a talk last spring that was ever so many are dead now for all i know and all off at the war now i work for the edification of proper young women who look in astonishment at me as they would consider themselves degraded by the pursuit a delicate pair of hands my flower mania will leave me then i hear dellies and morgans lessons after which i open my desk and am lost in the mysteries of arithmetic geography blairs lectures nol et chapsal ollendorff and reading aloud in french and english besides writing occasionally in each and sometimes a peep at lavoisne until very nearly dinner the day is not half long enough for me many things i would like to study i am forced to give up for want of leisure to devote to them but one of these days i will make up for present deficiencies i study only what i absolutely love now but then if i can i will study what i am at present ignorant of and cultivate a taste for something new the few moments before dinner and all the time after i devote to writing sewing knitting etc and if i included darning repairs alterations etc my list would be tremendous for i get through with a great deal of sewing somewhere in the day i find half an hour or more to spend at the piano before sunset i dress and am free to spend the evening at home or else walk to mrs brunots for it is not safe to go farther than those three squares away from home from early twilight until supper miriam and i sing with the guitar generally and after sit comfortably under the chandelier and read until about ten what little reading i do is almost exclusively done at that time it sounds woefully little but my list of books grows to quite a respectable size in the course of a year at ten comes my bible class for the servants lucy rose nancy and dophy assemble in my room and hear me read the bible or stories from the bible for a while then one by one say their prayers they cannot be persuaded to say them together dophy says she cant say with rose cause she aint got no brothers and sisters to pray for and lucy has no father or mother and so they go all difficulties and grievances during the day are laid before me and i sit like moses judging the children of israel until i can appease the discord sometimes it is not so easy for instance that memorable night when i had to work roses stubborn heart to a proper pitch of repentance for having stabbed a carving fork in lucys arm in a fit of temper i dont know that i was ever as much astonished as i was at seeing the dogged sullen girl throw herself on the floor in a burst of tears and say if god would forgive her she would never do it again i was lashing myself internally for not being able to speak as i should furious at myself for talking so weakly and lo here the girl tumbles over wailing and weeping and dophy overcome by her feelings sobs lucy i scratched you last week please forgive me this once and amazed and bewildered i look at the touching tableau before me of kissing and reconciliation for lucy can bear malice toward no one and is ready to forgive before others repent and i look from one to the other wondering what it was that upset them so completely for certainly no words of mine caused it sometimes lucy sings a wild hymn did you ever hear the heaven bells ring come my loving brothers when i put on my starry crown etc and after some such scene as that just described it is pleasant to hear them going out of the room saying goodnight miss sarah god bless miss sarah and all that a proclamation of van dorn has just been smuggled into town that advises all persons living within eight miles of the mississippi to remove into the interior as he is determined to defend his department at all hazards to the last extremity does not look like the peace i have been deluding myself with does it that means another exodus how are we to leave when we are not allowed to pass the limits of the corporation by the federals where are we to go we are between the two armies and here we must remain patiently awaiting the result some of these dark nights bang we will hear the cannon and then it will be sauve qui peut in a shower of shells bah i dont believe god will suffer that we should be murdered in such a dreadful way i dont believe he will suffer us to be turned homeless and naked on the world something will turn up before we are attacked and we will be spared i am certain we cant look forward more than an hour at a time now sometimes not a minute ahead witness the shelling frolic so i must resume my old habit of laying a clean dress on my bed before going to sleep which i did every night for six weeks before the shelling of baton rouge in order to run respectably as muslin crossbar nightgowns are not suitable for day dresses i am afraid i shall be nervous when the moment of the bombardment actually arrives this suspense is not calculated to soothe ones nerves a few moments since a salute was fired in honor of general butlers arrival when women children and servants rushed to the front of the houses confident of a repetition of the shelling which occurred a month ago today the children have not forgotten the scene for they all actually howled with fear poor little sarah stopped her screams to say mother dont you wish we was dogs stead o white folks in such piteous accents that we had to laugh dont i wish i was a dog sarah is right i dont know if i showed my uneasiness a while ago but certainly my heart has hardly yet ceased beating rather rapidly if i knew what moment to expect the stampede i would not mind but this way to expect it every instant it is too much again if i knew where we could go for refuge from the shells a window banging unexpectedly just then gave me a curious twinge not that i thought it was the signal oh dear no i just thought what i wonder pshaw picayune butlers coming coming has upset my nervous system he interrupted me in the middle of my arithmetic and i have not the energy to resume my studies i shall try what effect an hours practice will have on my spirits and will see that i have a pair of clean stockings in my stampede sack and that the fastenings of my runningbag are safe though if i expect to take either i should keep in harness constantly how long o lord how long any more mr lincoln any more cant you leave our racked homes in repose we are all wild last night five citizens were arrested on no charge at all and carried down to picayune butlers ship what a thrill of terror ran through the whole community we all felt so helpless so powerless under the hand of our tyrant the man who swore to uphold the constitution and the laws who is professedly only fighting to give us all liberty the birthright of every american and who nevertheless has ground us down to a state where we would not reduce our negroes who tortures and sneers at us and rules us with an iron hand ah liberty what a humbug i would rather belong to england or france than to the north bondage woman that i am i can never stand even now the northern papers distributed among us taunt us with our subjection and tell us how coolly butler will grind them down paying no regard to their writhing and torture beyond tightening the bonds still more ah truly this is the bitterness of slavery to be insulted and reviled by cowards who are safe at home and enjoy the protection of the laws while we captive and overpowered dare not raise our voices to throw back the insult and are governed by the despotism of one man whose word is our law and that man they tell us is the right man in the right place he will develop a union sentiment among the people if the thing can be done come and see if he can hear the curse that arises from thousands of hearts at that mans name and say if he will speedily bring us to our senses will he accomplish it by love tenderness mercy compassion he might have done it but did he try when he came he assumed his natural rle as tyrant and bravely has he acted it through never once turning aside for justice or mercy this degradation is worse than the bitterness of death i see no salvation on either side no glory awaits the southern confederacy even if it does achieve its independence it will be a mere speck in the world with no weight or authority the north confesses itself lost without us and has paid an unheardof ransom to regain us on the other hand conquered what hope is there in this world for us broken in health and fortune reviled contemned abused by those who claim already to have subdued us without a prospect of future support for those few of our brothers who return outcasts without home or honor would not death or exile be preferable oh let us abandon our loved home to these implacable enemies and find refuge elsewhere take from us property everything only grant us liberty is this rather frantic considering i abhor politics and women who meddle with them above all my opinion has not yet changed i still feel the same contempt for a woman who would talk at the top of her voice for the edification of federal officers as though anxious to receive an invitation requesting her presence at the garrison i can suffer and be still as far as outward signs are concerned but as no word of this has passed my lips i give it vent in writing which is more lasting than words partly to relieve my heart partly to prove to my own satisfaction that i am no coward for one line of this surrounded as we are by soldiers and liable to have our houses searched at any instant would be a sufficient indictment for high treason under general williamss rule i was perfectly satisfied that whatever was done was done through necessity and under orders from headquarters beyond his control we all liked him but now since butlers arrival i believe i am as frantic in secret as the others are openly i know that war sanctions many hard things and that both sides practice them but now we are so completely lost in louisiana is it fair to gibe and taunt us with our humiliation i could stand anything save the cowardly ridicule and triumph of their papers honestly i believe if all vile abusive papers on both sides were suppressed and some of the fireeating editors who make a living by lying were soundly cowhided or had their ears clipped it would do more towards establishing peace than all the bloodshedding either side can afford i hope to live to see it too seems to me more liberty is allowed to the press than would be tolerated in speech let us speak as freely as any paper and see if tomorrow we do not sleep at fort jackson this morning the excitement is rare fifteen more citizens were arrested and carried off and all the rest grew wild with expectation so great a martyrdom is it considered that i am sure those who are not arrested will be woefully disappointed it is ludicrous to see how each man thinks he is the very one they are in search of we asked a twopenny lawyer of no more importance in the community than dophy is if it was possible he was not arrested but i am expecting to be every instant so much for his selfassurance those arrested have some been quietly released those are so smiling and mysterious that i suspect them some been obliged to take the oath some sent to fort jackson ah liberty what a blessing it is to enjoy thy privileges if some of these poor men are not taken prisoners they will die of mortification at the slight our valiant governor the brave moore has by order of the real governor mose made himself visible at some fardistant point and issued a proclamation saying whereas we of baton rouge were held forcibly in town he therefore considered men women and children prisoners of war and as such the yankees are bound to supply us with all necessaries and consequently any one sending us aid or comfort or provisions from the country will be severely punished only moore is fool enough for such an order held down by the federals our paper money so much trash with hardly any other to buy food and no way of earning it threatened with starvation and utter ruin our own friends by way of making our burden lighter forbid our receiving the means of prolonging life and after generously warning us to leave town which they know is perfectly impossible prepare to burn it over our heads and let the women run the same risk as the men penned in on one little square mile here we await our fate like sheep in the slaughterpen our hour may be at hand now it may be tonight we have only to wait the booming of the cannon will announce it to us soon enough of the six sentenced to fort jackson one is the methodist minister mr craven the only charge is that he was heard to pray for the confederate states by some officers who passed his house during his family prayers according to that which of us would escape unhung i do not believe there is a woman in the land who closes her eyes before praying for gods blessing on the side on which her brothers are engaged are we all to cease show me the dungeon deep enough to keep me from praying for them the man represented that he had a large family totally dependent on him who must starve let them get up a subscription was general butlers humane answer i will head it myself it is useless to say the generous offer was declined as a specimen of the humanity of general butler let me record a threat of his uttered with all the force and meaning language can convey and certainly enough to strike terror in the hearts of frail women since all these men believe him fully equal to carry it into execution some even believe it will be done in speaking to mr solomon benjamin of foreign intervention in our favor he said let england or france try it and ill be if i dont arm every negro in the south and make them cut the throat of every man woman and child in it ill make them lay the whole country waste with fire and sword and leave it desolate draw me a finer picture of coward brute or bully than that one sentence portrays o men of the north you do your noble hearts wrong in sending such ruffians among us as the representatives of a great people was ever a more brutal thought uttered in a more brutal way mother like many another is crazy to go away from here even to new orleans but like the rest will be obliged to stand and await her fate i dont believe butler would dare execute his threat for at the first attempt thousands who are passive now would cut the brutal heart from his inhuman breast i heard such a good joke last night if i had belonged to the female declaiming club i fear me i would have resigned instantly through mere terror thank heaven i dont these officers say the women talk too much which is undeniable they then said they meant to get up a sewing society and place in it every woman who makes herself conspicuous by her loud talking about them fancy what a refinement of torture but only a few would suffer the majority would be only too happy to enjoy the usual privilege of sewing societies slander abuse and insinuations how some would revel in it the mere threat makes me quake if i could so far forget my dignity and my fathers name as to court the notice of gentlemen by contemptible insult etc and if i should be ordered to take my seat at the sewing society i would never hold my head up again member of a select sewing circle fancy me i know there is never any gossip in our society though the one over the way gets up dreadful reports i have heard all that but would rather try neither oh how i would beg and plead fifty years at fort jackson good kind general butler rather than half an hour in your sewing society gentle humane ruler spare me and i split my throat in shouting yankee doodle and hurrah for lincoln any every thing so i am not disgraced deliver me from your sewing society and ill say and do what you please butler told some of these gentlemen that he had a detective watching almost every house in town and he knew everything true or not it looks suspicious we are certainly watched every evening two men may be seen in the shadow on the other side of the street standing there until ever so late sometimes until after we have gone to bed it may be that far from home they are attracted by the bright light and singing and watch us for their amusement a few nights ago so many officers passed and repassed while we were singing on the balcony that i felt as though our habit of long standing had suddenly become improper saturday night having secured a paper we were all crowding around lilly and i reading every now and then a piece of news from opposite ends of the paper charlie walking on the balcony found five officers leaning over the fence watching us as we stood under the light through the open window hope they wont elect me to the sewing society another day of sickening suspense this evening about three came the rumor that there was to be an attack on the town tonight or early in the morning and we had best be prepared for anything i cant say i believe it but in spite of my distrust i made my preparations first of all i made a charming improvement in my knapsack alias pillowcase by sewing a strong black band down each side of the centre from the bottom to the top when it is carried back and fastened below again allowing me to pass my arms through and thus present the appearance of an old peddler miriams i secured also and tied all our laces in a handkerchief ready to lay it in the last thing but the interior of my bag what a medley it is first i believe i have secured four underskirts three chemises as many pairs of stockings two underbodies the prayer book father gave me tennyson that harry gave me when i was fourteen two unmade muslins a white mull english grenadine trimmed with lilac and a purple linen and nightgown then i must have lavinias daguerreotype and how could i leave wills when perhaps he was dead besides howells and will carters were with him and one single case did not matter but there was tom barkers i would like to keep and oh lets take mr stones and i cant slight mr dunnington for these two have been too kind to jimmy for me to forget and poor captain huger is dead and i will keep his so they all went together a box of pens too was indispensable and a case of french notepaper and a bundle of harrys letters were added miriam insisted on the old diary that preceded this and found place for it though i am afraid if she knew what trash she was to carry she would retract before going farther it makes me heartsick to see the utter ruin we will be plunged in if forced to run tonight not a hundredth part of what i most value can be saved if i counted my letters and papers not a thousandth but i cannot believe we will run tonight the soldiers tell whoever questions them that there will be a fight before morning but i believe it must be to alarm them though what looks suspicious is that the officers said to whom is not stated that the ladies must not be uneasy if they heard cannon tonight as they would probably commence to celebrate the fourth of july about twelve oclock what does it mean i repeat i dont believe a word of it yet i have not yet met the woman or child who is not prepared to fly rose knocked at the door just now to show her preparations her only thought seems to be mothers silver so she has quietly taken possession of our shoebag which is a long sack for odds and ends with cases for shoes outside and has filled it with all the contents of the silverbox this hung over her arm and carrying louis and sarah this young samson says she will be ready to fly i dont believe it yet here i sit my knapsack serving me for a desk my seat the chair on which i have carefully spread my clothes in order at my elbow lies my running or treasurebag surrounded by my cabas filled with hairpins starch and a band i was embroidering etc near it lie our combs etc and the whole is crowned by my dagger by the way i must add miriams pistol which she has forgotten though over there lies her knapsack ready too with our bonnets and veils it is long past eleven and no sound of the cannon bah i do not expect it ill lay me down and sleep in peace for thou only lord makest me to dwell in safety goodnight i wake up tomorrow the same as usual and be disappointed that my trouble was unnecessary here i am and still alive having wakened but once in the night and that only in consequence of louis and morgan crying nothing more alarming than that i ought to feel foolish but i do not i am glad i was prepared even though there was no occasion for it while i was taking my early bath lilly came to the bathhouse and told me through the weatherboarding of another battle stonewall jackson has surrounded mcclellan completely and victory is again ours this is said to be the sixth battle he has fought in twenty days and they say he has won them all and the seventh regiment distinguished itself and was presented with four cannon on the battlefield in acknowledgment of its gallant conduct gibbes belongs to the ragged howling regiment that rushed on the field yelling like unchained devils and spread a panic through the army as the northern papers said describing the battle of manassas oh how i hope he has escaped and they say palmerston has urged the recognition of the confederacy and an armed intervention on our side would it not be glorious oh for peace blessed peace and our brothers once more palmerston is said to have painted butler as the vilest oppressor and having added he was ashamed to acknowledge him of anglosaxon origin perhaps knowing the opinion entertained of him by foreign nations caused butler to turn such a somersault for a few days before his arrival here we saw a leading article in the leading union paper of new orleans threatening us with the arming of the slaves for our extermination if england interfered in the same language almost as butler used when here three days ago the same paper ridiculed the idea and said such a brutal inhuman thing was never for a moment thought of it was too absurd and so the world goes we all turn somersaults occasionally and yet i would rather we would achieve our independence alone if possible it would be so much more glorious and then i would hate to see england conquer the north even if for our sake my love for the old union is still too great to be willing to see it so humiliated if england would just make lincoln come to his senses and put an end to all this confiscation which is sweeping over everything make him agree to let us alone and behave himself that will be quite enough but what a task if it were put to the vote tomorrow to return free and unmolested to the union or stay out i am sure union would have the majority but this way to think we are to be sent to fort jackson and all the other prisons for expressing our ideas however harmless to have our houses burned over our heads and all the prominent men hanged who would be eager for it unless indeed it was to escape even the greater horrors of a war of extermination think that since the 28th of may i have not walked three squares at a time for my only walks are to mrs brunots it is enough to kill any one i might as well be at ship island where butler has sentenced mrs phillips for laughing while the corpse of a federal officer was passing at least that is to be the principal charge though i hope for the sake of butlers soul that he had better reasons shocking as her conduct was she hardly deserved two years close confinement in such a dreadful place as that because she happened to have no sense of delicacy and no feeling the darkest hour is just before the day we have had the blackest night for almost three months and i dont see the light yet better days are coming i am getting skeptical i fear me i look forward to my future life with a shudder this one cannot last long i will be up and doing before many months are past doing what why if all father left us is lost forever if we are to be penniless as well as homeless ill work for my living how i wonder i will teach i know i am not capable but i can do my best i would rather die than be dependent i would rather die than teach there now you know how i feel teaching before dependence death before teaching my soul revolts from the drudgery i never see a governess that my heart does not ache for her i think of the nameless numberless insults and trials she is forced to submit to of the hopeless thankless task that is imposed on her to which she is expected to submit without a murmur of all her griefs and agony shut up in her heart and i cry heaven help a governess my heart bleeds for them and thus far had i reached when news came that our forces were attacking the town and had already driven the pickets in i am well now we all rushed to make preparations instantly i had just finished washing my hair before i commenced writing and had it all streaming around me but it did not take a minute to thrust it into a loose net then we each put on a fresh dress except myself as i preferred to have a linen cambric worn several times before to a clean one not quite so nice for that can do good service when washed the excitement is intense mother is securing a few of fathers most valuable papers lilly running around after the children and waiting for charlie who cannot be found miriam after securing all things needful has gone downstairs to wait the issue and i dressed for instant flight with my runningbag tied to my waist and knapsack bonnet veil etc on the bed occupy my last few moments at home in this profitable way nobody knows what it is a regiment has been marched out to meet our troops some say commanded by van dorn which i doubt the gunboats are preparing to second them we hear the garrison drum and see people running that is all we dont know what is coming i believe it will prove nothing after all but the gunboat is drawn up so as to command our street here the guns aimed up the street just below and if a house falls ours will be about the first well this time next year we will know all of which we are now ignorant that is one consolation the house will either be down or standing then we have once more subsided how foolish all this seems miriam and i laughed while preparing and laughed while unpacking it is the only way to take such things and we agree on that as on most other subjects they say the affair originated from half a dozen shots fired by some federal soldiers through idleness whereupon the pickets rushed in screaming van dorn was after them at the head of six thousand men i have my reasons for doubting the story it must have been something more than that to spread such a panic for they certainly had time to ascertain the truth of the attack before they beat the long roll and sent out their troops for if it had been van dorn he would have been on them before that whatever it was i am glad of the excitement for it gave me new life for several hours i was really sick before oh this life when will it end evermore and forevermore shall we live in this suspense i wish we were in the sandwich islands as we have no longer a minister mr gierlow having gone to europe and no papers i am in danger of forgetting the days of the week as well as those of the month but i am positive that yesterday was sunday because i heard the sundayschool bells and friday i am sure was the fourth because i heard the national salute fired i must remember that to find my dates by well last night being sunday a son of captain hooper who died in the fort jackson fight having just come from new orleans stopped here on his way to jackson to tell us the news or rather to see charlie and told us afterwards he says a boat from mobile reached the city saturday evening and the captain told mr la noue that he brought an extra from the former place containing news of mcclellans surrender with his entire army his being mortally wounded and the instant departure of a french and english manofwar from hampton roads with the news that revived my spirits considerably all except mcclellans being wounded i could dispense with that but if it were true and if peace would follow and the boys come home oh what bliss i would die of joy as rapidly as i am pining away with suspense now i am afraid about ten oclock as we came up mother went to the window in the entry to tell the news to mrs day and while speaking saw a man creeping by under the window in the narrow little alley on the side of the house evidently listening for he had previously been standing in the shadow of a tree and left the street to be nearer when mother ran to give the alarm to charlie i looked down and there the man was looking up as i could dimly see for he crouched down in the shadow of the fence presently stooping still he ran fast towards the front of the house making quite a noise in the long tangled grass when he got near the pepperbush he drew himself up to his full height paused a moment as though listening and then walked quietly towards the front gate by that time charlie reached the front gallery above and called to him asking what he wanted without answering the man walked steadily out closed the gate deliberately then suddenly remembering drunkenness would be the best excuse gave a lurch towards the house walked off perfectly straight in the moonlight until seeing dr day fastening his gate he reeled again that man was not drunk drunken men cannot run crouching do not shut gates carefully after them would have no inclination to creep in a dim little alley merely to creep out again it may have been one of our detectives standing in the full moonlight which was very bright he certainly looked like a gentleman for he was dressed in a handsome suit of black he was no citizen form your own conclusions well after all he heard no treason let him play eavesdropper if he finds it consistent with his character as a gentleman the captain who brought the extra from mobile wished to have it reprinted but it was instantly seized by a federal officer who carried it to butler who monopolized it so that will never be heard of again we must wait for other means of information the young boy who told us reminds me very much of jimmy he is by no means so handsome but yet there is something that recalls him and his voice though more childish sounds like jimmys too i had an opportunity of writing to lydia by him of which i gladly availed myself and have just finished a really tremendous epistle poor miriam poor sarah they are disgraced again last night we were all sitting on the balcony in the moonlight singing as usual with our guitar i have been so accustomed to hear father say in the evening come girls where is my concert and he took so much pleasure in listening that i could not think singing in the balcony was so very dreadful since he encouraged us in it but last night changed all my ideas we noticed federals both officers and soldiers pass singly or by twos or threes at different times but as we were not singing for their benefit and they were evidently attending to their own affairs there was no necessity of noticing them at all but about halfpast nine after we had sung two or three dozen others we commenced mary of argyle as the last word died away while the chords were still vibrating came a sound of clapping hands in short down went every string of the guitar charlie cried i told you so and ordered an immediate retreat miriam objected as undignified but renounced the guitar mother sprang to her feet and closed the front windows in an instant whereupon dignified or not we all evacuated the gallery and fell back into the house all this was done in a few minutes and as quietly as possible and while the gas was being turned off downstairs miriam and i flew upstairs i confess i was mortified to death very very much ashamed but we wanted to see the guilty party for from below they were invisible we stole out on the front balcony above and in front of the house that used to be gibbess we beheld one of the culprits at the sight of the creature my mortification vanished in intense compassion for his he was standing under the tree half in the moonlight his hands in his pockets looking at the extinction of light below with the true state of affairs dawning on his astonished mind and looking by no means satisfied with himself such an abashed creature he looked just as though he had received a kick that conscious of deserving he dared not return while he yet gazed on the house in silent amazement and consternation hands still forlornly searching his pockets as though for a reason for our behavior from under the dark shadow of the tree another slowly picked himself up from the ground hope he was not knocked down by surprise and joined the first his hands sought his pockets too and if possible he looked more mortified than the other after looking for some time at the house satisfied that they had put an end to future singing from the gallery they walked slowly away turning back every now and then to be certain that it was a fact if ever i saw two mortified hangdoglooking men they were these two as they took their way home was it not shocking but they could not have meant it merely to be insulting or they would have placed themselves in full view of us rather than out of sight under the trees perhaps they were thinking of their own homes instead of us a proclamation is out announcing that any one talking about the war or present state of affairs will be summarily dealt with now seems to me summarily is not exactly the word they mean but still it has an imposing effect what a sad state their affairs must be in if they cant bear comment an officer arrived day before yesterday bringing the surprising intelligence that mcclellan had captured richmond and fifty thousand prisoners that is the time they talked but when we received yesterday confirmation of his being finally defeated by our troops and the capture of his railroad train twelve miles in length they forbid further mention of the subject i wonder if they expect to be obeyed what a stretch of tyranny o free america you who uphold free people free speech free everything what a foul blot of despotism rests on a once spotless name a nation of brave men who wage war on women and lock them up in prisons for using their woman weapon the tongue a nation of free people who advocate despotism a nation of brothers who bind the weaker ones hand and foot and scourge them with military tyrants and other free brotherly institutions what a picture who would not be an american one consolation is that this proclamation and the extraordinary care they take to suppress all news except what they themselves manufacture proves me our cause is prospering more than they like us to know i do believe day is about to break if our troops are determined to burn our houses over our heads to spite the yankees i wish they would hurry and have it over at once ten regiments of infantry are stationed at camp moore and scotts cavalry was expected at greenwell yesterday both preparing for an attack on baton rouge if we must be beggars let it come at once i cant endure this suspense a letter from george this morning it was written on the 20th of june and he speaks of being on crutches in consequence of his horse having fallen with him and injured his knee perhaps then he was not in the first battle of the 25th but bah i know george too well to imagine he would keep quiet at such a moment if he could possibly stand i am sure he was there with the rest of the louisiana regiment the papers say the conduct of the first louisiana is beyond all praise of course george was there and jimmy is with him at richmond but whether in the army or navy or what rank if in the first he does not say he only says he is looking remarkably well gibbes he had heard from in a letter dated the 16th and up to then he was in perfect health his last letter here was dated 10th of march so we are thankful enough now i was so delighted to read the accounts of the gallant seventh in some paper we fortunately procured at jacksons address and presentation of the battery they had so bravely won i was beside myself with delight i was thinking that gibbes of course was the regiment had taken the battery with his single sword and i know not what besides strange to say i have not an idea of the names of the halfdozen battles he was in in june but believe that one to be port republic brother writes that rumors of the capture of baton rouge by our troops have made him very uneasy about us and he wishes us to go down to new orleans if possible i wish we could the impression here is that an attack is inevitable and the city papers found it necessary to contradict the rumor of ruggles having occupied it already i wish mother would go i can see no difference there or here except that there we will be safe for a while at least i grow desperate when i read these northern papers reviling and abusing us reproaching us for being broken and dispersed taunting us with their victories sparing no humiliating name in speaking of us and laughing as to what well see when we vile rebels are driven out of virginia and the glorious union firmly established i cant bear these taunts i grow sick to read these vile insulting papers that seem written expressly to goad us into madness there must be many humane reasonable men in the north can they not teach their editors decency in this their hour of triumph a profitable way to spend such a day being forced to dispense with churchgoing i have occupied myself in reading a great deal and writing a little which latter duty is a favorite task of mine after church on sundays but this evening the mosquitoes are so savage that writing became impossible until miriam and i instituted a grand extermination process which we partly accomplished by extraordinary efforts she lay on the bed with the bar halfdrawn over her and halflooped up while i was commissioned to fan the wretches from all corners into the pen it was rather fatiguing and in spite of the numbers slain hardly recompensed me for the trouble of hunting them around the room but still miriam says exercise is good for me and she ought to know i have been reading that old disguster boswell bah i have no patience with the toady i suppose my mind is not yet thoroughly impregnated with the johnsonian ether and that is the reason why i cannot appreciate him or his work i admire him for his patience and minuteness in compiling such trivial details he must have been an amiable man to bear johnsons brutal illhumored remarks but seems to me if i had not spirit enough to resent the indignity i would at least not publish it to the world briefly my opinion which this book has only tended to confirm is that boswell was a vain conceited prig a fool of a jackanape an insupportable sycophant a whatever mean thing you please there is no word small enough to suit him as to johnson he is a surly old bear in short an old brute of a tyrant all his knowledge and attainments could not have made me tolerate him i am sure i could have no respect for a man who was so coarse in speech and manners and who eat like an animal fact is i am not a boswellian or a johnsonian either i do not think him such an extraordinary man i have heard many conversations as worthy of being recorded as nineteentwentieths of his in spite of his learning he was narrowminded and bigoted which i despise above all earthly failings witness his tirades against americans calling us rascals robbers pirates and saying he would like to burn us now i have railed at many of these ordinary women here for using like epithets for the yankees and have felt the greatest contempt for their absurd abuse these poor women do not aspire to johnsonian wisdom and their ignorance may serve as an excuse for their narrowmindedness but the wondrous johnson to rave and bellow like any billingsgate nymph bah he is an old disguster another pleasant excitement news has just arrived that scotts cavalry was having a hard fight with the yankees eight miles from town everybody immediately commenced to pick up stray articles and get ready to fly in spite of the intense heat i am resigned as i hardly expect a shelling another report places the fight fourteen miles from here a man on horseback came in for reinforcements heaven help poor howell if it is true i am beginning to doubt half i hear people tell me the most extravagant things and if i am fool enough to believe them and repeat them i suddenly discover that it is not half so true as it might be and as they themselves frequently deny having told it all the odium of manufacturing rests on my shoulders which have not been accustomed to bear lies of any kind i mean to cease believing anything unless it rests on the word of some responsible person by the way the order i so confidently believed concerning the proclamation turns out not quite so bad i was told women were included and it extended to private houses as well as public ones though i fortunately omitted that when i recorded it when i read it it said all discussions concerning the war are prohibited in barrooms public assemblies and street corners as women do not frequent such places and private houses are not mentioned i cannot imagine how my informant made the mistake unless like me it was through hearing it repeated odious as i thought it then i think it wise now for more than one man has lost his life through discussions of the kind it is decided that i am to go to new orleans next week i hardly know which i dislike most going or staying i know i shall be dreadfully homesick but remember and keep quiet sarah i beg of you everything points to an early attack here some say this week the federals are cutting down all our beautiful woods near the penitentiary to throw up breastworks some say cannon are to be planted on the foundation of mr pikes new house everybody is in a state of expectation honestly if baton rouge has to be shelled i shall hate to miss the fun it will be worth seeing and i would like to be present even at the risk of losing my big toe by a shell but then by going i can save many of my clothes and then miriam and i can divide when everything is burned that is one advantage besides being beneficial by the change of air they say the town is to be attacked tonight i dont believe a word of it oh i was so distressed this evening they tell me mr biddle was killed at vicksburg i hope it is not true suppose it was a shot from wills battery last night the town was in a dreadful state of excitement before sunset a regiment that had been camped out of town came in and pitched their tents around the new theatre in front of our church all was commotion and bustle and as the pickets had been drawn in and the soldiers talked freely of expecting an attack everybody believed it and was consequently in rather an unpleasant state of anticipation their cannon were on the commons back of the church the artillery horses tied to the wheels while some dozen tents were placed around filled with men who were ready to harness them at the first alarm with all these preparations in full view we went to bed as usual i did not even take the trouble of gathering my things which i had removed from my peddler sack and slept satisfied that if forced to fly i would lose almost everything in spite of my precaution in making a bag well night passed and here is morning and nothing is heard yet the attack is delayed until this evening or tomorrow they say woman though i am i am by no means as frightened as some of these men are i cant get excited about it perhaps it is because they know the danger and i do not but i hate to see men uneasy i have been so accustomed to brave fearless ones who would beard the devil himself that it gives me a great disgust to see any one less daring than father and the boys i have been so busy preparing to go to the city that i think if the frolic should intervene and prevent my departure i would be disappointed though i do not want to go it would be unpleasant for instance to pack all i own in my trunk and just as i place the key in my pocket to hear the shriek of van dorn raised again this time it is to be ruggles though i would not mind if he came before i was packed besides even if i miss the fun here they say the boats are fired into from plaquemine and then i have the pleasure of being in a fight anyhow mother is alarmed about that part of my voyage but miriam and i persuaded her it is nothing if i was a man oh would nt i be in richmond with the boys what is the use of all these worthless women in war times if they attack i shall don the breeches and join the assailants and fight though i think they would be hopeless fools to attempt to capture a town they could not hold for ten minutes under the gunboats how do breeches and coats feel i wonder i am actually afraid of them i kept a suit of jimmys hanging in the armoir for six weeks waiting for the yankees to come thinking fright would give me courage to try it what a seeming paradox but i never succeeded lilly one day insisted on my trying it and i advanced so far as to lay it on the bed and then carried my bird out i was ashamed to let even my canary see me but when i took a second look my courage deserted me and there ended my first and last attempt at disguise i have heard so many girls boast of having worn mens clothes i wonder where they get the courage to think half the men in town sat up all night in expectation of a stampede while we poor women slept serenely everybody is digging pits to hide in when the ball opens the days have dug a tremendous one the wolffs sheppers and some fifty others have taken the same precaution they may as well dig their graves at once what if a tremendous shell should burst over them and bury in the dirt those who were not killed oh no let me see all the danger and the way it is coming at once tomorrow or day after in case no unexpected little incident occurs in the interval i purpose going to new orleans taking fathers papers and part of miriams and mothers valuables for safekeeping i hate to go but they all think i should as it will be one less to look after if we are shelled which i doubt i dont know that i require much protection but i might as well be agreeable and go ouf how i will grow homesick before i am out of sight here we go sure enough at precisely eleven oclock while we were enjoying our first dreams we were startled by the long roll which was beat half a square below us at first i only repeated the roll of the drum without an idea connected with it but hearing the soldiers running in another instant i was up and was putting on my stockings when miriam ran in in her nightgown the children were roused and dressed quickly and it did not take us many instants to prepare the report of two shots and the tramp of soldiers cries of doublequick and sound as of cannon moving rather hastening our movements armoirs bureaus and everything else were thrown open and miriam and i hastily packed our sacks with any articles that came to hand having previously taken the precaution to put on everything fresh from the armoir we have saved what we can but i find myself obliged to leave one of my new muslins i had just finished as it occupied more room than i can afford the body of my lovely lilac and my beauteous white mull but then i have saved eight halfmade linen chemises that will be better than the outward show here comes an alarm of fire at least a dreadful odor of burning cotton which has set everybody wild with fear that conflagration is to be added to these horrors the cavalry swept past on their way to the river ten minutes ago and here comes the news that the gunboats are drawing up their anchors and making ready well here an hour has passed suppose they do not come after all i have been watching two sentinels at the corner who are singing and dancing in the gayest way one reminds me of gibbes i have seen him dance that way often i was glad to see a goodhumored man again i wish i was in bed i am only sitting up to satisfy my conscience for i have long since ceased to expect a real bombardment if it must come let it be now i am tired of waiting a crowd of women have sought the protection of the gunboats i am distressed about the brunots suppose they did not hear the noise o girls if i was a man i wonder what would induce me to leave you four lone unprotected women sleeping in that house unconscious of all this is manhood a dream that is past is humanity an idle name fatherless brotherless girls if i was honored with the title of man i do believe i would be fool enough to run around and wake you at least not another word though i shall go mad with rage and disgust i am going to bed this must be a humbug morgan came running in once more in his nightgear begging lilly to hear his prayers in answer to her why you have said them tonight he says yes but ive been getting up so often poor child no wonder he is perplexed one hour and a half of this nonsense and no result known we are told the firing commenced and the pickets were driven in twenty minutes before the long roll beat it is impossible to discover the true story of last nights alarm some say it was a gang of negroes who attacked the pickets in revenge for having been turned out of the garrison others say it was a number of our soldiers who fired from the bushes and the most amusing story is that they took alarm at an old white horse which they killed mistaking him for the confederates one regiment has refused to do picket duty and the story runs among these poor soldiers that our army which is within a mile is perfectly overwhelming the excitement still continues i have been writing to the brunots the news confirming the death of mcclellan the surrender of his army and the good tidings of our rams recent exploits above vicksburg and her arriving safely under the guns there if we could keep all the dispatches that have passed between us since the battle of the forts what a collection of absurdity and contradiction it would be forts have been taken their ships have passed forts safe yankees at our mercy ships at new orleans city to be bombarded in twelve hours forts surrendered city under british protection no it is nt city surrendered mistake baton rouge to be burned when yankee ships come and soon sometimes three times a day each dispatch contradicting the other and all equally ridiculous the crowd here seems to increase the streets are thronged with the military and it will soon be impossible to go even to mrs brunots which will be a great privation to me five thousand are to come next week and then it will really be impossible to go in the streets another such day and there is the end of me charlie decided to send lilly and the children into the country early tomorrow morning and get them safely out of this doomed town mother miriam and i were to remain here alone take the children away and i can stand whatever is to come but this constant alarm with five babies in the house is too much for any of us so we gladly packed their trunks and got them ready and then news came pouring in first a negro man just from the country told lilly that our soldiers were swarming out there that he had never seen so many men then dena wrote us that a mrs bryan had received a letter from her son praying her not to be in baton rouge after wednesday morning as they were to attack tomorrow then a man came to charlie and told him that though he was on parole yet as a mason he must beg him not to let his wife sleep in town tonight to get her away before sunset but it is impossible for her to start before morning hearing so many rumors all pointing to the same time we began to believe there might be some danger so i packed all necessary clothing that could be dispensed with now in a large trunk for mother miriam and me and got it ready to send out in the country to mrs williams all told i have but eight dresses left so ill have to be particular i am wealthy compared to what i would have been sunday night for then i had but two in my sack and now i have my best in the trunk if the attack comes before the trunk gets off or if the trunk is lost we will verily be beggars for i pack well and it contains everything of any value in clothing the excitement is on the increase i think everybody is crazy to leave town yes that must be the date for one day and two nights have passed since i was writing here where shall i begin the story of my wanderings i dont know that it has a beginning it is all so hurried and confused but it was tuesday evening that the federals were seized with a panic which threw the whole town in alarm they said our troops were within eight miles ten thousand in number the report was even started that the advance guard was skirmishing with the federals the shots were heard distinctly a dozen people were ready to swear the yankees struck their tents galloped with their cannon through the streets with the most terrific din troops passed at doublequick on their way to the garrison everything was confusion mr tunnard told us yesterday he was present when part of them reached the gate of the garrison and saw one of the officers spring forward waving his sword and heard him cry trot men gallop i say damn you run in with a perfect yell at the close whereupon all lookerson raised a shout of laughter for the man was frightened out of his wits a federal officer told him that their fright was really a disgrace and if one thousand of our men had come in town the whole thirtyfive hundred would have been at their mercy even the naval officers denounce it as a most arrant piece of cowardice for instead of marching their troops out to meet ours they all rushed into the garrison where if attacked their only retreat would have been into the river the gunboats were ordered into the middle of the stream in front of the garrison and cooped up there these valiant men awaited the assault in such trepidation that yesterday they freely said the force could be purchased for fifty cents they are so ashamed of their panic imagine what effect this had on the inhabitants soon an exodus took place in the direction of the asylum and we needs must follow the general example and run too in haste we packed a trunk with our remaining clothes what we could get in and the greatest confusion prevailed for an hour beatrice had commenced to cry early in the evening and redoubled her screams when she saw the preparations and louis joining in they cried in concert until eight oclock when we finally got off what a din lilly looked perfectly exhausted that look on her face made me heartsick miriam flew around everywhere mother always had one more article to find and the noise was dreadful when white and black assembled in the hall ready at last charlie placed half of the trunks on the dray leaving the rest for another trip and we at last started off besides the inevitable runningbag tied to my waist on this stifling night i had my sunbonnet veil comb toothbrush cabas filled with dozens of small articles and dagger to carry and then my heart failed me when i thought of my guitar so i caught it up in the case and remembering fathers heavy inkstand i seized that too with two fans if i was asked what i did with all these things i could not answer certain it is i had every one in my hands and was not very ridiculous to behold seventeen in number counting white and black our procession started off each loaded in their own way the soldiers did not scruple to laugh at us those who were still waiting in front of the churches to be removed laughed heartily and cried hello where are you going running goodbye fortunately they could not see our faces for it was very dark one stopped us under a lamppost and wanted us to go back he said he knew we were to be attacked for the confederates were within five miles but we were as safe at home as at the asylum he was a very handsome respectablelooking man though dirty as yankee soldiers always are and in his shirtsleeves besides we thanked him for his kindness and went on all stopped at the brunots to see that they were ready to fly but the two parties were so tremendous that we gladly divided and miriam and i remained with them until they could get ready while our detachment went on wagons carts every vehicle imaginable passed on to places of safety loaded with valuables while women and children hurried on on foot it took the brunots as long to prepare as it did us i had to drag sophie out of her bed where she threw herself vowing she would not run and after an interminable length of time we were at last ready and started with the addition of mrs loucks and her sons in our train the volunteer whose sole duty seems to be to watch the brunots met us as we got out he stopped as he met the first looked in silence until sophie and i passed and then burst out laughing no wonder what a walk it was nobody hesitated to laugh even though they meant to run themselves and we made fun of each other too so our walk was merry enough when we reached there the asylum was already crowded at least it would have been a crowd in any other place though a mere handful in such a building the whole house was illuminated up to the fifth story and we were most graciously received by the director who had thrown the whole house open to whoever chose to come and exerted himself to be accommodating it looked like a tremendous hotel where every one is at home not a servant or one of the deaf and dumb children was to be seen we had all the lower story to ourselves was nt it pleasant to unload and deposit all things in a place of safety it was a great relief then we five girls walked on the splendid balcony which goes around the house until we could no longer walk when i amused myself by keeping poor sophie standing since she would not sit down like a christian but insisted on going to bed like a lazy girl as she is when i finally let her go it did not take her many minutes to undress and soon we were all ready for bed the brunots had beds on the parlor floor across the wide hall we had a room opposite and next to ours lilly and the children were all sleeping soundly i ran the blockade of the hall in my nightgown and had a splendid romp with the girls after rolling sophie out of bed and jerking nettie up mother and mrs brunot cried order laughing but they came in for their share of the sport until an admiring crowd of females at the door told us by their amused faces they were enjoying it too so i ran the gauntlet again and got safely through the hall and after a few more inroads in one of which miriam accompanied me and on which occasion i am sure we were seen in our nightgowns we finally went to bed i wont say went to sleep for i did not pretend to doze all our side of the house had bars except me and the mosquitoes were unendurable so i watched mother and miriam in their downy slumbers and lay on my hard bed for hours fighting the torments with bare arms every now and then i heard a stir among the females above indicating that some few were anticipating a panic once they took a rush from the fourth story and cried they heard the cannon twenty guns had been fired etc i lay still determined not to believe it and presently all subsided i lay there for hours longer it seemed when nettie at last wandered in disconsolate to find if we were asleep for with the exception of sophie they too had been awake all night i went to the parlor with her when she dena and i decided to dress at once and sit on the balcony since sleep was hopeless behold me in a blue muslin flounced to the waist with a cape too what a running costume miriam only had time to take off her white dress before starting all dressed we went to the northwest corner as far as possible from the rest of the household and sat in a splendid breeze for hours it was better than fighting insatiable mosquitoes so there we sat talking through the greater part of a night which seemed to have borrowed a few additional hours for our benefit well have no leap year in 64 the twentyfour extra hours were crowded in on that occasion i think we discussed our favorite books characters authors repeated scraps here and there of the mock sentimental talked of how we would one day like to travel and where we would go discussed love and marriage and came to the conclusion neither was the jest it was thought to be o wise young women poor nettie retired in despair and we two watched alone for hours longer the sun must have been arrested by some joshua on the road could nt make me believe it was doing its duty as usual we wandered around the balconies through the grounds in the dim starlight for it was cloudy and finally beholding a faint promise of morning sat still and waited for the coming of the lazy sun what was still more aggravating was that every time we looked in at the others showed them sleeping peacefully miriam lay her full length with outstretched arms the picture of repose looking so comfortable when the sun finally made his appearance he was out on a spree i found for his eyes were not half opened and he looked dull and heavy as he peeped from behind his bed curtains others began to stir and in an hour more we were ready to leave those who had slept came out with swelled eyes and drowsy looks while we three who had been up all night were perfectly calm though rather pale but i am seldom otherwise were we not thankful to see home still standing i did not feel tired much but somehow when it struck halfpast six and i found myself alone here miriam having stopped at mrs days i suddenly found myself divested of my flounces and most other articles and involuntarily going towards the bed i could not sleep was nt thinking of such a thing meant to there was an end of my soliloquy where i went i dont know as the clock struck eight i got up as unaccountably and discovered i had lost all idea of time in sleep if it had not been for the clock i should have said i had slept a day and a night and it was now thursday morning a giant refreshed i rose from my slumbers took a hasty cup of coffee and set to work packing lillys trunk for i was crazy to see the children off as soon as possible it was no short work but we all hurried said goodbye and saw them go with a feeling of relief by the experience of the night before we knew that when the real moment came it would be impossible to get them off in time to escape danger poor lilly we miss her sadly but are thankful to know that she is out of danger with her poor little children she looked heartbroken at the idea of leaving us alone but then when one weak woman has five small babies to take care of is it fair to impose three big ones on her id never stay here if she sacrificed her children to take care of us who need no protection i was very lazy after they left and sat reading until a note was brought from charlie saying they were safe beyond the lines last night came another alarm some fifty cannon were fired somewhere above reports came that a body of our troops were a few miles out so a thousand of these men took courage and went out to reconnoitre mrs brunot and mother insisted on going again to the asylum for protection against the coming attack though we at first begged and pleaded to stay at home but we had to follow and i dont think any of us were in the best of humors as we were all conscious of doing a foolish thing we were cordially received again and got quite gay sleeping accommodations no better than before as far as i was concerned sophie miriam and i had but one bar between us so we placed two mattresses side by side and by dint of chairs and strings stretched the net as far as possible over them those two were well enough but to my share fell a babys mattress two feet by four placed between the wall and the other great bed with the end of the bar a foot above my face and one sheet to do the duty of two however they had only one also well i believe i am tall so my bed did not fit me as it was two inches higher than theirs there was no sharing in spite of a heavy rain that was now pouring my warm place was intolerable and the perspiration streamed from my face so as to be disagreeable to say the least it drove me to walk in my sleep i am afraid for i have an indistinct recollection of finding myself standing at the window trying to breathe it was a very very little piece of sleep i got after all and that little by no means refreshing up at sunrise again but it took some time to get ready for i had to get some clothes out of the trunk to send home well ever since i reached here i have been writing and i am ashamed to say how long it is as the time grows more exciting my book grows shorter to my great distress what will i do we all vowed that would be the last time we would run until we heard the cannon or had some better reason than a yankee panic to believe the confederates were coming though if we listened to mother she would go there every night if this lasted for a whole year kind phillie nolan wrote insisting on our staying with them on the plantation until it was over but we cannot do it the time is too uncertain if we knew it was to come this week we might stay that long with her but to go for an indefinite period miriam and i would not hear of i have kept for the last a piece of news i received with thankfulness when i finally heard it for though known to the whole family and all the town on tuesday night no one thought it worth while to tell me until i heard it by accident last evening it was that a mr bell writing to his wife says gibbes asked him to send word to mother that he george and jimmy were in the fight of the 10th and 11th and all safe god be praised an old gentleman stopped here just now in a carriage and asked to see me such a sad sick old man he said his name was caldwell and that passing through east feliciana mrs flynn had asked him to deliver a message to us had we heard from our brothers i told him the message from mr bell he commenced crying there was one of them he said who got hurt i held my breath and looked at him he cried more still and said yes it was gibbes in the hand not dangerous but here i thought he meant to tell me worse perhaps he was dead but i could not speak so he went on saying lydia and the general had gone on to richmond instantly and had probably reached there before today he took so long to tell it and he cried so that i was alarmed until i thought perhaps he had lost one of his own sons but i dared not ask him just then one of the horses fell down with sunstroke and i begged the old gentleman to come in and rest until they could raise the horse but he said no he must go on to the river he looked so sick that i could not help saying he looked too unwell to go beyond and i wished he would come in but he burst into tears saying yes my child i am very very sick but i must go on poor old man with his snowwhite beard i have my bird back as i waked this morning i heard a wellknown chirp in the streets and called to mother i knew it was jimmy sure enough it is my bird lucy daigre has had him ever since the shelling as a negro caught it that day and gave it to her this town with its ten thousand soldiers is more quiet than it was with the old population of seven thousand citizens with this tremendous addition it is like a graveyard in its quiet at times these poor soldiers are dying awfully thirteen went yesterday on sunday the boats discharged hundreds of sick at our landing some lay there all the afternoon in the hot sun waiting for the wagon to carry them to the hospital which task occupied the whole evening in the mean time these poor wretches lay uncovered on the ground in every stage of sickness cousin will saw one lying dead without a creature by to notice when he died another was dying and muttering to himself as he lay too far gone to brush the flies out of his eyes and mouth while no one was able to do it for him cousin will helped him though another a mere skeleton lay in the agonies of death too but he evidently had kind friends for several were gathered around holding him up and fanning him while his son leaned over him crying aloud tiche says it was dreadful to hear the poor boys sobs all day our visvis baumstark with his several aids plies his hammer all day sunday he made coffins and says he cant make them fast enough think too he is by no means the only undertaker here oh i wish these poor men were safe in their own land it is heartbreaking to see them die here like dogs with no one to say godspeed the catholic priest went to see some sometime ago and going near one who lay in bed said some kind thing when the man burst into tears and cried thank god i have heard one kind word before i die in a few minutes the poor wretch was dead i believe i forgot to mention one little circumstance in my account of that first night at the deaf and dumb asylum which at the time struck me with extreme disgust that was seeing more than one man who had no females or babies to look after who sought there a refuge from the coming attack at daylight one dapper young man in fashionable array came stepping lightly on the gallery carrying a neat carpetbag in his hand i hardly think he expected to meet two young ladies at that hour i shall always believe he meant to creep away before any one was up for he certainly looked embarrassed when we looked up though he assumed an air of indifference and passed by bravely swinging his sack but i think he wanted us to believe he was not ashamed i dare say it was some little clerk in his holiday attire but i cant say what contempt i felt for the creature honestly i believe the women of the south are as brave as the men who are fighting and certainly braver than the home guard i have not yet been able to coax myself into being as alarmed as many i could name are they say it is because i do not know the danger soit i prefer being brave through ignorance to being afraid in consequence of my knowledge of coming events thank heaven my brothers are the bravest of the brave i would despise them if they shrunk back though lucifer should dispute the path with them well all men are not morgan boys they tell me cowards actually exist though i hope i never met one the poor men that went to the asylum for safety might not have what lavinia calls a moral backbone no wonder then they tumbled in there besides i am told half the town spent the night on the banks of the river on that occasion and perhaps these unfortunates were subject to colds and preferred the shelter of a good roof poor little fellows how i longed to give them my hoops corsets and pretty blue organdie in exchange for their boots and breeches only i thought it was dangerous for suppose the boots had been so used to running that they should prance off with me too why it would ruin my reputation miss morgan in petticoats is thought to be as brave as any other man but these borrowed articles might make her fly as fast as any other man too if panic is contagious as the yankees here have proved one consolation is that all who could go with any propriety and all who were worthy of fighting among those who believed in the south are off at the seat of war it is only trash and those who are obliged to remain for private reasons who still remain let us count those young individuals as trash and step over them only ask heaven why you were made with a mans heart and a female form and those creatures with beards were made as bewitchingly nervous i had thought my running days were over so little did i anticipate another stampede that i did not notice the report of the attack that was prophesied for night before last and went to bed without gathering my clothes but today comes a hasty note from charlie telling us to leave instantly as general breckinridge is advancing with ten thousand men to attack us and at 12 m yesterday was within thirtyfour miles he begged us to leave today there would be trouble before tomorrow night it was so earnest and he asserted all so positively that we are going to phillies this evening to stay a week as they say eight days will decide ah me our beautiful town still i am skeptical if it must be pray heaven that the blow comes now nothing can be equal to suspense these poor men are they not dying fast enough will baumstark have orders for an unlimited supply of coffins next week only charlies family ours and the brunots know it he enjoined the strictest secrecy though the brunots sent to swear mrs loucks in as she like ourselves has no protector i would like to tell everybody but it will warn the federals i almost wish we too had been left in ignorance it is cruel to keep it to ourselves i believe the yankees expect something they say they have armed fifteen hundred negroes foes and insurrection in town assailing friends outside nice time our cavalry has passed the amite poor charlie has come all the way to the ferry landing on the other side to warn us if we do not take advantage it will not be for want of knowing what is to come how considerate it was in him to come such a long way i am charmingly excited if i only had a pair of breeches my happiness would be complete let it come i lose all but in heavens name let us have it over at once my heart fails when i look around but spit fire and have an end to this at once liberty forever though death be the penalty treason here lies my pass at my elbow in which has been gratuitously inserted that parties holding it are considered to give their parole not to give information countenance aid or support to the socalled confed s as i did not apply for it agree to the stipulation or think it by any means proper i dont consider it binding i could not give my word for doing what my conscience tells me is right i cross with this book full of treason it countenances the c s shall i burn it that is a stupid ruse they are too wise to ask you to subscribe to it they just append it enfin nous sommes arrives and after what a trip as we reached the ferry i discovered i had lost the pass and had to walk back and search for it aided by mr tunnard who met me in my distress as it has always been his luck to do but somebody had already adopted the valuable trifle so i had to rejoin mother and miriam without it the guard resolutely refused to let us pass until we got another so off flew mr tunnard to procure a second which was vastly agreeable as i knew he would have to pay twentyfive cents for it yankees having come down as low as that to procure money but he had gone before we could say anything and soon returned with the twobits worth of leave of absence then we crossed the river in a little skiff after sundown in a most unpleasant state of uncertainty as to whether the carriage was waiting at the landing for us for i did not know if phillie had received my note and there was no place to go if she had not sent for us however we found it waiting and leaving mother and miriam to pay the ferry i walked on to put our bundles in the carriage a man stepped forward calling me by name and giving me a note from charlie before i reached it and as i placed my foot on the step another came up and told me he had left a letter at home for me at one oclock i bowed yes it was from howell must answer tomorrow he asked me not to mention it was him a little servant had asked his name but he told her it was none of her business i laughed at the refined remark and said i had not known who it was he would hardly have been flattered to hear i had not even inquired he modestly said that he was afraid i had seen him through the window oh no i assured him well please anyhow dont say its me he pleaded most grammatically i answered smiling i did not know who it was then i know no more now and if you choose i shall always remain in ignorance of your identity he burst out laughing and went off with oh do miss morgan forget all about me as though it was a difficult matter who can he be we had a delightful drive in the moonlight though it was rather long and it was quite late when we drove up to the house and were most cordially welcomed by the family we sat up late on the balcony listening for the report of cannon which however did not come baton rouge is to be attacked tomorrow they say pray heaven it will all be over by that time nobody seems to doubt it over here a while ago a long procession of guerrillas passed a short distance from the house looking for a party of yankees they heard of in the neighborhood and waved their hats for lack of handkerchiefs to us as we stood on the balcony i call this writing under difficulties here i am employing my knee as a desk a position that is not very natural to me and by no means comfortable i feel so stupid from want of sleep last night that no wonder i am not even respectably bright i think i shall lay aside this diary with my pen i have procured a nicer one so i no longer regret its close what a stupid thing it is as i look back how faintly have i expressed things that produced the greatest impression on me at the time and how completely have i omitted the very things i should have recorded bah it is all the same trash and here is an end of it for this volume whose stupidity can only be equaled by the one that precedes and the one that is to follow it but who expects to be interesting in war times if i kept a diary of events it would be one tissue of lies think there was no battle on the 10th or 11th mcclellan is not dead and gibbes was never wounded after that who believes in reliable information not i here we are at dr nolans plantation with baton rouge lying just seven miles from us to the east we can surely hear the cannon from here they are all so kind to us that i ought to be contented but still i wish i was once more at home i suppose it is very unreasonable in me but i cannot help it i miss my old desk very much it is so awkward to write on my knee that i cannot get used to it mine is a nice little room upstairs detached from all the rest for it is formed by a large dormer window looking to the north from which i have seen a large number of guerrillas passing and repassing in their rough costumes constantly i enjoy the fresh air and all that but pleasant as it is i wish i was at home and all the fuss was over virginia nolan and miriam are already equipped in their riding costumes so i must lay this down and get ready to join them in a scamper across the fields how delighted i will be to get on a horse again about halfpast nine as we got up from the breakfast table a guerrilla told us the ram arkansas was lying a few miles below on her way to coperate with breckinridge whose advance guard had already driven the pickets into baton rouge then we all grew wild with excitement such exclamations such delight that the dreadful moment had at last arrived and yet you could see each stop as we rejoiced to offer up a prayer for the preservation of those who were risking their lives at that moment reason and all else was thrown aside and we determined to participate in the danger if there was any to be incurred mother threatened us with shot and shell and bloody murder but the loud report of half a dozen cannon in slow succession only made us more determined to see the fun so lilly nolan and miss walters got on horseback and phillie ginnie miriam and i started off in the broiling sun leaving word for the carriage to overtake us when we once got in the driver being as crazy as we fairly made his horses run along the road to catch a glimpse of our ram when miles below she came in sight we could no longer remain in the carriage but mounted the levee and ran along on foot until we reached her when we crossed to the outer levee and there she lay at our feet and nothing in her after all there lay a heavy clumsy rusty ugly flatboat with a great square box in the centre while great cannon put their noses out at the sides and in front the decks were crowded with men rough and dirty jabbering and hastily eating their breakfast that was the great arkansas god bless and protect her and the brave men she carries while there a young man came up and in answer to phillies inquiries about her father who having gone to town yesterday to report being paroled had written last night to say no passes were granted to leave town the young fellow informed her so pleasantly that her father was a prisoner held as hostage for mr castle poor phillie had to cry so to be still more agreeable he told her yes he had been sent to a boat lying at the landing and ran the greatest risk as the ram would probably sink the said boat in a few hours how i hated the fool for his relish of evil tidings but never mind our wild expedition or what came of it am i not patient ever since i commenced to write the sound of a furious bombardment has been ringing in my ears and beyond an occasional run to see the shells fly through the air their white smoke rather i have not said a word of it the girls have all crowded on the little balcony up here towards town and their shrieks of there it goes listen look at them rise above the sound of the cannon and occasionally draw me out too but i sit here listening and wonder which report precedes the knocking down of our home which shell is killing some one i know and love poor tiche and dophy where are they and oh i hope they did not leave my birdie jimmy to die in his cage i charged them to let him loose if they could not carry him dophy will be so frightened i hope they are out of danger oh my dear home shall i ever see you again and the brunots oh how i hope they are safe these loud cannon make me heartsick and yet i am so excited how rapidly they answer each other i am told the attack commenced at five this morning and lasted three hours those girls are shouting that baton rouge must be on fire from the volume of smoke in that direction how they scream as the balls go up to show it to each other i think ill take a look too we are all going four or five miles through this warm sun to be nearer the scene of action any one might know there was no white man on the premises there is the carriage oh i am so seasick what will i be before we get back we six madcaps got in the carriage and buggy and rode off in search of news we took a quantity of old linen rags along and during the whole drive our fingers were busy making lint once we stopped at a neighbors to gather the news but that did not interfere with our labors at all four miles from here we met a crowd of women flying and among them recognized mrs la noue and nomie a good deal of loud shouting brought them to the carriage in great surprise to see us there they were running from the plantation where they had taken refuge as it was not safe from the shells as the gunboats had proved to them the reports we had heard in the morning were from shots fired on this side of the river by them in hopes of hurting a guerrilla or two nomie told us that two western regiments had laid down their arms and general williams had been killed by his own men she looked so delighted and yet it made me sick to think of his having been butchered so phillie leaned out and asked her as she asked everybody if she knew anything about her father nomie in her rapture over that poor mans death exclaimed dont know a word about him know williams was cut to pieces though and that is all we could learn from her we went on until we came in sight of baton rouge there it stood looking so beautiful against the black lowering sky that i could not but regret its fate we could see the garrison state house asylum and all that but the object of the greatest interest to me was the steeple of the methodist church for to the right of it lay home while looking at it a negro passed who was riding up and down the coast collecting lint so i gave him all we had made and commenced some more presently we met mr phillips to whom phillie put the same question he is on the laurel hill a prisoner confound that negro where did he go and so on each answer as far as concerned her seeming a labor but the part relating to the servant very hearty poor phillie complained that everybody was selfish thought only of their own affairs and did not sympathize with her yes my dear i silently assented for it was very true every one seemed to think of their own interests alone it was late before we got home and then we had great fun in watching shells which we could dimly trace against the clouds falling in what must have been the garrison then came a tremendous fire above which may have been a boat i dont know i hear a tremendous firing again and from the two volumes of smoke should judge it was the arkansas and the essex trying their strength at a distance we are going down to see whats the fun it would be absurd to record all the rumors that have reached us since we can rely on none they say we fought up to nine last night and occupied the garrison for five minutes when the shells forced us to abandon it also that four regiments laid down their arms that the federals were pursued by our men to the river driven to the gunboats and pushed off to prevent the western men from coming aboard an eyewitness from this side reports that general williams they say was forcibly held before a cannon and blown to pieces for the sake of humanity i hope this is false oh what a sad day this is for our country mother disapproved so of our going to the levee to see the fight that we consented to remain though miriam and ginnie jumped into the buggy and went off alone presently came tidings that all the planters near baton rouge were removing their families and negroes and that the yankees were to shell the whole coast from there up to here then phillie lilly nolan and i jumped in the carriage that was still waiting and ran after the others to bring them back before they got in danger but when we reached the end of the long lane we saw them standing on the high levee wringing their hands and crying we sprang out and joined them and there way at the bend lay the arkansas on fire all except myself burst into tears and lamentations and prayed aloud between their sobs i had no words or tears i could only look at our sole hope burning going and pray silently oh it was so sad think it was our sole dependence and we five girls looked at her as the smoke rolled over her watched the flames burst from her decks and the shells as they exploded one by one beneath the water coming up in jets of steam and we watched until down the road we saw crowds of men toiling along toward us then we knew they were those who had escaped and the girls sent up a shriek of pity on they came dirty halfdressed some with only their guns others a few with bundles and knapsacks on their backs grimy and tired but still laughing we called to the first and asked if the boat were really afire they shouted yes and went on talking still presently one ran up and told us the story how yesterday their engine had broken and how they had labored all day to repair it how they had succeeded and had sat by their guns all night and this morning as they started to meet the essex the other engine had broken how each officer wrote his opinion that it was impossible to fight her with any hope of success under such circumstances and advised the captain to abandon her how they had resolved to do so had exchanged shots with the essex across the point and the first of the latter only one also had set ours afire when the men were ordered to take their side arms they thought it was to board the essex assembled together when the order was given to fire the arkansas and go ashore which was done in a few minutes several of the crew were around us then and up and down the road they were scattered still in crowds miriam must have asked the name of some of the officers for just then she called to me he says that is mr read i looked at the foot of the levee and saw two walking together i hardly recognized the gentleman i was introduced to on the mcrae in the one that now stood below me in rough sailor pants a pair of boots and a very thin and slazy lisle undershirt that is all he had on except an old straw hat and yes he held a primer i did not think it would be embarrassing to him to meet me under such circumstances i only thought of jimmys friend as escaping from a sad fate so i rushed down a levee twenty feet high saying o mr read you wont recognize me but i am jimmys sister he blushed modestly shook my hand as though we were old friends and assured me he remembered me was glad to meet me etc then miriam came down and talked to him and then we went to the top of the levee where the rest were and watched the poor arkansas burn by that time the crowd that had gone up the road came back and we found ourselves in the centre of two hundred men just we five girls talking with the officers around us as though they were old friends you could only guess they were officers for a dirtier more forlorn set i never saw not dirty either they looked clean considering the work they had been doing nobody introduced anybody else we all felt like brothers and sisters in our common calamity there was one handsome kentuckian whose name i soon found to be talbot who looked charmingly picturesque in his coarse cottonade pants white shirt straw hat black hair beard and eyes with rosy cheeks he was a graduate of the naval academy some years ago then another jollyfaced young man from the same academy pleased me too he the doctor and the captain were the only ones who possessed a coat in the whole crowd the few who saved theirs carrying them over their arms mr read more than once blushingly remarked that they were prepared to fight and hardly expected to meet us but we pretended to think there was nothing unusual in his dress i can understand though that he should feel rather awkward i would not like to meet him if i was in the same costume they all talked over their loss cheerfully as far as the loss of money watches clothes were concerned but they were disheartened about their boat one threw himself down near my feet saying me voil i have saved my gun et puis the clothes that i stand in and laughed as though it were an excellent joke one who had been on the merrimac chiefly regretted the loss of the commission appointing him there though he had not saved a single article the one with the jolly face told me will pinckney was among those attacking baton rouge and assured him he expected to take supper there last night he thought it would be with us i know i hope he is safe after a while the men were ordered to march up the lane to some resting spot it is best not to mention here and straggled off but there were many sick among them one wounded at vicksburg and we instantly voted to walk the mile and three quarters home and give them the carriage and buggy but long after they left we stood with our new friends on the levee watching the last of the arkansas and saw the essex and two gunboats crowded with men cautiously turn the point and watch her burn what made me furious was the thought of the glowing accounts they would give of their capture of the arkansas capture and they fired a shot apiece for all the firing we heard was the discharge of her guns by the flames we saw them go back as cautiously and i was furious knowing the accounts they would publish of what we ourselves had destroyed we had seen many shells explode and one magazine and would have waited for the other if the clouds had not threatened rain speedily but we had to leave her a mere wreck still burning and started off on our long walk in our hurry i had brought neither handkerchief nor gloves but hardly missed either i was so excited mr talbot walked home with me and each of the others with some one else he had a small bundle and a sword and the latter i insisted on carrying it was something to shoulder a sword made for use rather than for ornament so i would carry it he said he would remember who had carried it and the recollection would give it a new value in his eyes and i might rest assured it should never be disgraced after that and all that sort of thing of course as it is usual to say it on such occasions but i shouldered the sword bravely determined to show my appreciation of the sacrifice they had made for us in coming to our rescue on a boat they had every reason to believe was unsafe i liked mr talbot he made himself very agreeable in that long walk he asked permission to send me a trophy from the first action in which he used that sword and did nt i say yes he thought southern men had every encouragement in the world from the fact that the ladies welcomed them with great kindness in victory or defeat insinuating he thought they hardly deserved our compassion after their failure on the arkansas but i stoutly denied that it was a failure had they not done their best was it their fault the machinery broke and in defeat or victory were they not still fighting for us were we the less grateful when they met with reverse oh did nt i laud the southern men with my whole heart and i think he felt better for it too yes i like him we all met at the steps and water was given to our cavaliers who certainly enjoyed it we could not ask them in as dr nolan is on his parole but phillie intimated that if they chose to order they might do as they pleased as women could not resist armed men so they took possession of the sugarhouse and helped themselves to something to eat and were welcome to do it since no one could prevent but they first stood talking on the balcony gayly and we parted with many warm wishes on both sides insisting that if they assisted at a second attack on baton rouge they must remember our house was at their service wounded or in health and they all shook hands with us and looked pleased and said god bless you and goodbye i heard a while ago the doctor of the ram who brought back the buggy say the arkansass crew were about leaving so remembering poor mr read had lost everything mother suggesting he might need money gave me twenty dollars to put in his hands as some slight help towards reaching his destination besides coming from jimmys mother he could not have been hurt but when i got down he was far up the lane walking too fast for me to overtake him then i tried to catch mr stephenson to give it to him for me but failed presently we saw i am afraid to say how many wagons loaded with them coming from the sugarhouse so phillie lilly and i snatched up some five bottles of gin between us and ran out to give it to them a rough old sailor received mine with a flood of thanks and the others gave theirs to those behind an officer rode up saying ladies there is no help for it the yankee cavalry are after us and we must fight them in the corn take care of yourselves we shouted yes told them to bring in the wounded and we would nurse them then the men cried god bless you and we cried hurrah for the arkansass crew and fight for us altogether it was a most affecting scene phillie seeing how poorly armed they were suggested a gun which i flew after and delivered to a rough old tar when i got out the cart then passing held mr talbot who smiled benignly and waved his hat like the rest he looked still better in his black coat but the carts reminded me of what the guillotine days must have been in france he shouted goodbye we shouted come to us if you are wounded he smiled and bowed and i cried use that sword whereupon he sprang to his feet and grasped the hilt as though about to commence then came other officers mr scales mr barblaud etc who smiled recognition stopped the wagon as phillie handed up a plate of bread and meat and talked gayly as they divided it until the captain rode up on gentlemen not a moment to lose then the cart started off the empty plate was flung overboard and they rode off waving hats and crying god bless you ladies in answer to our repeated offers of taking care of them if they were hurt and they have gone to meet the yankees and i hope they wont for they have worked enough today and from my heart i pray god prosper those brave men last night shortly after we got in bed we were roused by loud cannonading towards baton rouge and running out on the small balcony up here saw the light of a great fire in that direction from the constant reports and the explosion of what seemed to be several powder magazines we imagined it to be either the garrison or a gunboat whatever it was it was certainly a great fire we all ran out in our nightgowns and watched for an hour in the damp air i without even shoes we listened to the fight a long while until the sound ceased and we went back to bed i am so disheartened i have been listening with the others to a man who was telling us about baton rouge until i am heartsick he says the yankees have been largely reinforced and are prepared for another attack which will probably take place tomorrow that the fight was a dreadful one we driving them in and losing twelve hundred to their fifteen hundred it must have been awful and that our troops have resolved to burn the town down since they cannot hold it under the fire of the gunboats again last night about nine we heard cannon in baton rouge and watched the flashes which preceded the reports by a minute at least for a long time we must have seen our own firing perhaps we wanted to find out the batteries of the enemy it was not the most delightful thing imaginable to watch what might be the downfall of our only home and then to think each ball might bring death to some one we love ah no it was not pleasant miriam and i have many friends in breckinridges division i expect if we could only hear the names of the regiments the fourth is certainly there and poor will i wonder if he has had his supper yet i have been thinking of him ever since mr scales told me he was there and praying myself sick for his safety and that of the rest i shut my eyes at every report and say oh please poor will and the others too and when i dont hear the cannon i pray to be in advance of the next it is now midday and again we hear firing but have yet to learn the true story of the first days fight preserve me from the country in such stirring days we might as well be in europe as to have the mississippi between us and town by unanimous consent the little lane in front of the house has been christened guerrilla lane and the long one leading to the river arkansas what an episode that was in our lives the officers go by the name of miriams ginnies sarahs as though they belonged to each those girls did me the meanest thing imaginable mr talbot and i were planning a grand combined attack on baton rouge in which he was to command a fleet and attack the town by the river while i promised to get up a battalion of girls and attack them in the rear we had settled it all except the time when just then all the others stopped talking i went on and now it is only necessary for you to name the day here the girls commenced to giggle and the young men tried to suppress a smile i felt annoyed but it did not strike me until after they had left that i had said anything absurd what evil imaginations they must have if they could have fancied i meant anything except the battle to our great surprise charlie came in this morning from the other side he was in the battle and general carter and dozens of others that we did not think of see the mountain reduced to a molehill he says though the fight was desperate we lost only eightyfive killed and less than a hundred and fifty wounded and we had only twentyfive hundred against the yankees four thousand five hundred there is no truth in our having held the garrison even for a moment though we drove them down to the river in a panic the majority ran like fine fellows but a maine regiment fought like devils he says will and thompson bird set fire to the yankee camp with the greatest alacrity as though it were rare fun general williams was killed as he passed pipers by a shot from a window supposed to have been fired by a citizen some one from town told him that the federals were breaking in the houses destroying the furniture and tearing the clothes of the women and children in shreds like maniacs o my home i wonder if they have entered ours what a jolly time they would have over all the letters i left in my desk butler has ordered them to burn baton rouge if forced to evacuate it looks as though he was not so sure of holding it miss turner told miriam that her mother attempted to enter town after the fight to save some things when the gallant colonel dudley put a pistol to her head called her an old shedevil and told her he would blow her d brains out if she moved a step that anyhow none but we d women had put the men up to fighting and we were the ones who were to blame for the fuss there is no name he did not call us is this really sunday never felt less pious or less seriously disposed listen to my story and though i will of course fall far short of the actual terror that reigned yet it will show it in a lukewarm light that can at least recall the excitement to me to begin then last evening about six oclock as we sat reading sewing and making lint in the parlor we heard a tremendous shell whizzing past which those who watched said passed not five feet above the house of course there was a slight stir among the unsophisticated though we who had passed through bombardments sieges and alarms of all kinds coolly remarked a shell and kept quiet the latter class was not very numerous it was from one of the three yankee boats that lay in the river close by the essex and two gunboats which were sweeping teams provisions and negroes from all the plantations they stopped at from baton rouge up the negroes it is stated are to be armed against us as in town where all those who manned the cannon on tuesday were for the most part killed and served them right another shell was fired at a carriage containing mrs durald and several children under pretense of discovering if she was a guerrilla doubtless fortunately she was not hurt however by the time the little meute had subsided determined to have a frolic miss walters ginnie and i got on our horses and rode off down the arkansas lane to have a gallop and a peep at the gunboats from the levee but mothers entreaties prevented us from going that near as she cried that it was well known they fired at every horse or vehicle they saw in the road seeing a thousand guerrillas in every puff of dust and we were sure to be killed murdered and all sorts of bloody deaths awaited us so to satisfy her we took the road about a mile from the river in full view however we had not gone very far before we met a mr watson a plain farmer of the neighborhood who begged us to go back youll be fired on ladies sure you dont know the danger take my advice and go home as quick as possible before they shell you they shot buggies and carriages and of course they wont mind horses with women please go home but ginnie who had taken a fancy to go on acted as spokeswoman and determined to go on in spite of his advice so nothing loath to follow her example we thanked him and rode on another met us looked doubtful said it was not so dangerous if the yankees did not see the dust but if they did we would be pretty apt to see a shell soon after here was frolic so we rode on some mile or two beyond but failing to see anything startling turned back again about two miles from here we met mr watson coming at full speed the ladies he said had sent him after us in all haste there was a report that the whole coast was to be shelled a lady had passed flying with her children the carriage was ordered out they were only waiting for us to run too we did not believe a word of it and were indignant at their credulity as well as determined to persuade them to remain where they were if possible when told their plan was to run to the house formerly used as a guerrilla camp we laughed heartily suppose the yankees fired a shell into it to discover its inhabitants the idea of choosing a spot so well known and what fun in running to a miserable hole when we might sleep comfortably here i am afraid rebellion was in the air indeed an impudent little negro who threw open the gate for us interrupted ginnie in the midst of a tirade with a sly heres the beginning of a little fuss we found them all crazy with fear i did not say much i was too provoked to trust myself to argue with so many frightened women i only said i saw no necessity ginnie resisted but finally succumbed mr watson whom we had enlisted on our side also said it was by no means necessary but if we were determined we might go to his house about four miles away and stay there it was very small but we were welcome we had in the mean time thrown off our ridingskirts and stood just in our plain dresses though the others were freshly dressed for an exodus before the man left the carriage came though by that time we had drawn half the party on our side we said we would take supper and decide after so he went off in a few moments a rocket went up from one of the boats which attracted our attention five minutes after we saw a flash directly before us see it lightning i expect said phillie the others all agreed but i kept quiet knowing that some at least knew what it was as well as i and determined not to give the alarm for i was beginning to feel foolish before half a minute more came a tearing hissing sound a skyrocket whose music i had heard before instantly i remembered my runningbag and flew upstairs to get it escaping just in time from the scene which followed on the gallery which was afterwards most humorously described to me but i was out of hearing of the screams of each and yet i must have heard them neither saw miss walters tumble against the wall nor mother turn over her chair nor the general mle that followed in which mrs walters trying to scale the carriage was pulled out by uncle will who shouted to his plunging horses first then to the other unreasoning creatures woa there t aint safe take to the fields take to the woods run to the sugarhouse take to your heels in a frenzy of excitement i escaped all that and was putting on my hoops and hastily catching up any article that presented itself to me in my speed when the shell burst over the roof and went rolling down on the gallery according to the account of those then below two went far over the house out of sight all three were seen by mr watson who came galloping up in a few moments crying ladies for gods sake leave the house then i heard mother calling sarah you will be killed leave your clothes and run and a hundred ejaculations that came too fast for me to answer except by an occasional coming if you will send me a candle candle was the same as though i had demanded a handgrenade in mothers opinion for she was sure it would be the signal for a bombardment of my exposed room so i tossed down my bundles swept combs and hairpins into my bosom all points up and ravished a candle from some one how quickly i got on then i saved the most useless of articles with the greatest zeal and probably left the most serviceable ones one single dress did my runningbag contain a white linen cambric with a tiny pink flower the one i wore when i told hal goodbye for the last time the others i left when i got down with my knapsack mother phillie and mrs walters were i dont mean those ladies were but that i am at present ill account for it after i have disposed of the stampede imagine no interruption and continue in the carriage urging uncle will to hurry on and i had hardly time to thrust my sack under their feet before they were off lilly and miss walters were already in the buggy leaving ginnie and me to follow on horseback i ran up after my ridingskirt which i was surprised to find behind a trunk and rolled up in it was my runningbag with all my treasures i was very much provoked at my carelessness indeed i cannot imagine how it got there for it was the first thing i thought of when i got back there was no one to be seen except ginnie and two negroes who held our horses and who disappeared the instant we were mounted with the exception of two women who were running to the woods we were the only ones on the lot until mr watson galloped up to urge us on again i had to notice this peculiarity about women that the married ones are invariably the first to fly in time of danger and always leave the young ones to take care of themselves here were our three matrons prophesying that the house would be burnt the yankees upon us and all murdered in ten minutes flying down the guerrilla lane and leaving us to encounter the horrors they foretold alone it was a splendid gallop in the bright moonlight over the fields only it was made uncomfortable by the jerking of my runningbag until i happily thought of turning it before a hard ride of four miles in about twenty minutes brought us to the house of the man who so kindly offered his hospitality it was a little hut about as large as our parlor and already crowded to overflowing as he was entertaining three families from baton rouge cant imagine where he put them either but it seems to me the poorer the man and the smaller the house the greater the hospitality you meet with there were so many of us that there was not room on the balcony to turn the man wanted to prepare supper but we declined as phillie had sent back for ours which we had missed i saw another instance of the pleasure the vulgar take in the horrible a mr hill speaking of dr nolan told phillie he had no doubt he had been sent to new orleans on the whiteman that carried general williamss body and that every soul had gone down on her fortunately just then the overseer brought a letter from him saying he had gone on another boat or the mans relish of the distressing might have been gratified it was so crowded there that we soon suggested going a short distance beyond to mr lobdells and staying there for the night as all strenuously objected to our returning home as there was danger from prowling yankees so we mounted again and after a short ride we reached the house where all were evidently asleep but necessity knows no rules and the driver soon aroused an old gentleman who came out and invited us in a middleaged lady met us and made us perfectly at home by leaving us to take care of ourselves most people would have thought it indifference but i knew it was manque de savoir faire merely and preferred doing as i pleased if she had been officious i would have been embarrassed so we walked in the moonlight ginnie and i while the rest sat in the shade and all discussed the fun of the evening those who had been most alarmed laughing loudest the old gentleman insisted that we girls had been the cause of it all that our white bodies i wore a russian shirt and black skirts could easily have caused us to be mistaken for men that at all events three or four people on horseback would be a sufficient pretext for firing a shell or two in short young ladies he said there is no doubt in my mind that you were mistaken for guerrillas and that they only wanted to give you time to reach the woods where they heard they have a camp before shooting at you in short take my advice and never mount a horse again when there is a yankee in sight we were highly gratified at being mistaken for them and pretended to believe it was true i hardly think he was right though it is too preposterous pourtant sunday morning the yankees told a negro they did not mean to touch the house but were shooting at some guerrillas at a camp just beyond we know the last guerrilla left the parish five days ago our host insisted on giving us supper though phillie represented that ours was on the road and by eleven oclock tired alike of moonlight and fasting we gladly accepted and rapidly made the preserves and battercakes fly ours was a garret room well finished abounding in odd closets and corners with curious dormer windows that were reached by long little corridors i should have slept well but i lay awake all night mother and i occupied a narrow single bed with a bar of the thickest heaviest material imaginable suffocation awaited me inside gnats and mosquitoes outside in order to be strictly impartial i lay awake to divide my time equally between the two attractions and think i succeeded pretty well so i spent the night on the extreme edge of the bed never turning over but fanning mother constantly i was not sorry when daybreak appeared but dressed and ascended the observatory to get a breath of air below me i beheld four wagons loaded with the young mrs lobdells baggage the yankees had visited them in the evening swept off everything they could lay their hands on and with a sick child she was obliged to leave her house in the night and fly to her fatherinlaw i wondered at their allowing her four wagons of trunks and bundles it was very kind if i were a federal i think it would kill me to hear the whisper of hide the silver wherever i came their having frequently relieved families of such trifles along with negroes teams etc has put others on their guard now as i sat in the parlor in the early morning mrs walters en blouse volante and all chevele came in to tell me of mr lobdells misfortunes they took his negroes right hand up his teams left hand up his preserves both hands clutching her hair they swept off everything except four old women who could not walk they told him if he did nt come report himself theyd come fetch him in three days they beggared him both eyes rolling like a ship in a storm i could not help laughing mr bird sat on the gallery and had been served in the same way with the addition of a pair of handcuffs for a little while it was not a laughing matter but the old lady made it comical by her gestures when we suggested returning there was another difficulty all said it was madness that the yankees would sack the house and burn it over our heads we would be insulted etc i said no one yet had ever said an impudent thing to me and yankees certainly would not attempt it but the old gentleman told me i did not know what i was talking about so i hushed but determined to return ginnie and i sat an hour on horseback waiting for the others to settle what they would do and after having halfroasted ourselves in the sun they finally agreed to go too and we set off in a gallop which we never broke until we reached the house which to our great delight we found standing and not infested with yankees another restingplace out of reach of shells for the first time since last april for how long i wonder for wherever we go we bring shells and yankees would not be surprised at a visit from them out here now let me take up the thread of that neverending story and account for my present position it all seems tame now but it was very exciting at the time as soon as i threw down bonnet and gloves i commenced writing but before i had halfway finished mother who had been holding a consultation downstairs ran up to say the overseer had advised us all to leave as the place was not safe and that i must pack up instantly as unless we got off before the essex came up it would be impossible to leave at all all was commotion every one flew to pack up phillie determined to go to her friends at grosse tte and insisted on carrying us off with her but i determined to reach miriam and lilly if possible rather than put the federal army between us all en dshabill i commenced to pack our trunk but had scarcely put an article in when they cried the essex was rounding the point and our last opportunity passing away then i flew and by the time the boat got opposite to us the trunk was locked and i sat on it completely dressed waiting for the wagon we had then to wait for the boat to get out of sight to avoid a broadside so it was halfpast ten before we set off fortified by several glasses of buttermilk apiece all went in the carriage except ginnie lilly nolan and me and we perched on the baggage in the wagon such stifling heat the wagon jarred dreadfully and seated at the extreme end on a wooden trunk traversed by narrow slats ginnie and i were jolted until we lost our breath all down arkansas lane when we changed for the front part i shall never forget the heat of that day four miles beyond the carriage stopped at some house and still determined to get over the river i stepped into the little cart that held our trunks drove up to the side of it and insisted on mothers getting in rather than going the other way with phillie i had a slight discussion and overcame mothers reluctance to phillies objections with some difficulty but finally prevailed on the former to get into the cart and jolted off amid a shower of reproaches regrets and goodbyes i knew i was right though and the idea reconciled me to the heat dust jarring and gunboat that was coming up behind us six miles more brought us to mr cains where we arrived at two oclock tired dirty and almost unrecognizable we were received with the greatest cordiality in spite of that mother knew both him and his wife but though i had never seen either the latter kissed me as affectionately as though we had known each other it was impossible to cross when the gunboat was in sight so they made us stay with them until the next morning a bath and clean clothes soon made me quite presentable and i really enjoyed the kindness we met with in spite of a tearing headache and a distended feeling about the eyes as though i never meant to close them again the consequence of my vigil i presume o those dear kind people i shall not soon forget them mr cain told mother he believed he would keep me at all events he would make an exchange and give her his only son in my place i told him i was willing as mother thought much more of her sons than of her daughters i forgot to say that we met general allens partner a mile or two from dr nolans who told us it was a wise move that he had intended recommending it all he owned had been carried off his plantation stripped he said he had no doubt that all the coast would be ravaged and they had promised to burn his and many other houses and dr nolans though it might possibly be spared in consideration of his being a prisoner and his daughter being unprotected would most probably suffer with the rest but even if spared it was no place for women he offered to take charge of us all and send the furniture into the interior before the yankees should land which phillie gladly accepted what a splendid rest i had at mrs cains i was not conscious of being alive until i awaked abruptly in the early morning with a confused sense of having dreamed something very pleasant mr cain accompanied us to the ferry some miles above riding by the buggy and leaving us under care of mr randallson after seeing us in the large flat took his leave after an hour spent at the hotel after landing on this side we procured a conveyance and came on to mr elders where we astonished lilly by our unexpected appearance very much miriam had gone over to spend the day with her so we were all together and talked over our adventures with the greatest glee after dinner miriam and i came over here to see them all leaving the others to follow later i was very glad to see helen carter once more if i was not i hope i may live in yankeeland and i cant invoke a more dreadful punishment than that well here we are and heaven only knows our next move but we must settle on some spot which seems impossible in the present state of affairs when no lodgings are to be found i feel like a homeless beggar will pinckney told them here that he doubted if our house were still standing as the fight occurred just back of it and every volley directed towards it he says he thought of it every time the cannon was fired knowing where the shot would go i am in despair miss jones who has just made her escape from town brings a most dreadful account she with seventyfive others took refuge at dr enderss more than a mile and a half below town at halls it was there we sent the two trunks containing fathers papers and our clothing and silver hearing that guerrillas had been there the yankees went down shelled the house in the night turning all those women and children out who barely escaped with their clothing and let the soldiers loose on it they destroyed everything they could lay their hands on if it could not be carried off broke open armoirs trunks sacked the house and left it one scene of devastation and ruin they even stole miss joness braid she got here with nothing but the clothes she wore this is a dreadful blow to me yesterday i thought myself beggared when i heard that our house was probably burnt remembering all the clothing books furniture etc that it contained but i consoled myself with the recollection of a large trunk packed in the most scientific style containing quantities of nightgowns skirts chemises dresses cloaks in short our very best which was in safety winter had no terrors when i thought of the nice warm clothes i only wished i had a few of the organdie dresses i had packed up before wearing and now it is all gone silver fathers law papers without which we are beggars and clothing nothing left i could stand that but as each little article of harrys came up before me i had put many in the trunk i lost heart they may clothe their negro women with my clothes since they only steal for them but to take things so sacred to me o my god teach me to forgive them poor miss jones they went into her clothesbag and took out articles which were certainly of no service to them for mere deviltry there are so many sufferers in this case that it makes it still worse the plantation just below was served in the same way whole families fired into before they knew of the intention of the yankees was it not fine sport i have always been an advocate of peace if we could name the conditions ourselves but i say war to the death i would give my life to be able to take arms against the vandals who are laying waste our fair land i suppose it is because i have no longer anything to lose that i am desperate before i always opposed the burning of baton rouge as a useless piece of barbarism in turning out five thousand women and children on the charity of the world but i noticed that those who had no interest there warmly advocated it lilly nolan cried loudly for it thought it only just but the first shell that whistled over her fathers house made her crazy with rage the brutes the beasts how cruel wicked etc it was too near home for her then there is the greatest difference between my property and yours i notice that the further i get from town the more ardent are the people to have it burned it recalls very forcibly thackerays cut in the virginians when speaking of the determination of the rebels to burn the cities he says he observed that all those who were most eager to burn new york were inhabitants of boston while those who were most zealous to burn boston had all their property in new york it is true all the world over and i am afraid i am becoming indifferent about the fate of our town anything so it is speedily settled tell me it would be of service to the confederacy and i would set fire to my home if still standing willingly but would it another sunday strange that the time which should seem so endless flies so rapidly miriam complains that sunday comes every day but though that seems a little too much i insist that it comes twice a week let time fly though for each day brings us so much nearer our destiny which i long to know thursday we heard from a lady just from town that our house was standing the day before which somewhat consoled us for the loss of our silver and clothing but yesterday came the tidings of new afflictions i declare we have acted out the first chapter of job all except that verse about the death of his sons and daughters god shield us from that i do not mind the rest while he was yet speaking another came in and said thy brethren and kinsmen gathered together to wrest thine abode from the hand of the philistines which pressed sore upon thee when lo the philistines sallied forth with fire and sword and laid thine habitation waste and desolate and i only am escaped to tell thee yes the yankees fearing the confederates might slip in unseen resolved to have full view of their movements so put the torch to all eastward from colonel mattas to the advocate that would lay open a fine tract of country alone but unfortunately it is said that once started it was not so easy to control the flames which spread considerably beyond their appointed limits some say it went as far as florida street if so we are lost as that is a halfsquare below us for several days the fire has been burning but very little can be learned of the particulars i am sorry for colonel matta such a fine brown stone front the finest in town poor minna poverty will hardly agree with her as for our home i hope against hope i will not believe it is burnt until somebody declares having been present on that occasion yet so many frame houses on that square must have readily caught fire from the sparks wicked as it may seem i would rather have all i own burned than in the possession of the negroes fancy my magenta organdie on a dark beauty bah i think the sight would enrage me miss joness trials are enough to drive her crazy she had the pleasure of having four officers in her house men who sported epaulets and red sashes accompanied by a negro woman at whose disposal all articles were placed the worthy companion of these gentlemen walked around selecting things with the most natural airs and graces this she would say we must have and some of these books you know and all the preserves and these chairs and tables and all the clothes of course and yes the rest of these things so she would go on the gentlemen assuring her she had only to choose what she wanted and that they would have them removed immediately madame thought they really must have the wine and those handsome cutglass goblets i hardly think i could have endured such a scene to see all i owned given to negroes without even an accusation being brought against me of disloyalty one officer departed with a fine velvet cloak on his arm another took such a bundle of miss joness clothes that he had to have it lifted by some one else on his horse and rode off holding it with difficulty this i heard from herself yesterday as i spent the day with lilly and mother at mr elders where she is now staying can anything more disgraceful be imagined they all console me by saying there is no one in baton rouge who could possibly wear my dresses without adding a considerable piece to the belt but that is nonsense another pull at the corset strings would bring them easily to the size i have been reduced by nature and bones besides o horror suppose instead they should let in a piece of another color that would annihilate me pshaw i do not care for the dresses if they had only left me those little articles of fathers and harrys but that is hard to forgive yesterday two colonels shields and breaux both of whom distinguished themselves in the battle of baton rouge dined here their personal appearance was by no means calculated to fill me with awe or even to give one an idea of their rank for their dress consisted of merely cottonade pants flannel shirts and extremely short jackets which however is rapidly becoming the uniform of the confederate states just three lines back three soldiers came in to ask for molasses i was alone downstairs and the nervous trepidation with which i received the dirty coarsely clad strangers who however looked as though they might be gentlemen has raised a laugh against me from the others who looked down from a place of safety i dont know what i did that was out of the way i felt odd receiving them as though it was my home and having to answer their questions about buying by means of acting as telegraph between them and mrs carter i confess to that but i know i talked reasonably about the other subjects playing hostess in a strange house of course it was uncomfortable and to add to my embarrassment the handsomest one offered to pay for the milk he had just drunk fancy my feelings as i hastened to assure him that general carter never received money for such things and from a soldier besides it was not to be thought of he turned to the other saying in mississippi we dont meet with such people miss they dont hesitate to charge four bits a canteen for milk they take all they can they are not like you louisianians i was surprised to hear him say it of his own state but told him we thought here we could not do enough for them last evening after hard labor at pulling molasses candy needing some relaxation after our severe exertions we determined to have some fun though the sun was just setting in clouds as watery as new orleans milk and promised an early twilight all day it had been drizzling but that was nothing so anna badger miriam and i set off through the mud to get up the little cart to ride in followed by cries from the elder ladies of girls soap is a dollar and a half a bar starch a dollar a pound take up those skirts we had all started stiff and clean and it did seem a pity to let them drag so up they went you can imagine how high when i tell you my answer to annas question as to whether hers were in danger of touching the mud was not unless you sit down the only animal we could discover that was not employed was a poor old pony most appropriately called tom thumb and him we seized instantly together with a man to harness him we accompanied him from the stable to the quarter where the cart was through mud and water urging him on with shouts and cries and laughing until we could laugh no longer at the appearance of each the cart had been hauling wood but that was nothing to us in we tumbled and with a driver as diminutive as the horse started off for mr elders where we picked up all the children to be found and went on all told we were twelve drawn by that poor horse who seemed at each step about to undergo the ham process and leave us his hind quarters while he escaped with the fore ones and harness i dare say we never enjoyed a carriage as much though each was holding a muddy child riding was very fine but soon came the question how shall we turn which was not so easily solved for neither horse nor boy understood it in the least every effort to describe a circle brought us the length of the cart farther up the road and we promised fair to reach bayou sara before morning at that rate at last after fruitless efforts to dodge under the harness and escape pony came to a standstill and could not be induced to move the children took advantage of the pause to tumble out but we sat still bogged and it was very dark already would nt we get it when we got home anna groaned uncle albert miriam laughed the general i sighed mrs carter we knew what we deserved and darker and darker it grew and pony still inflexible at last we beheld a buggy on a road near by and in answer to morgans shouts of uncle uncle come turn our cart a gentleman jumped out and in an instant performed the herculean task pony found motion so agreeable that it was with the greatest difficulty we prevailed on him to stop while we fished seven children out of the mud as they pursued his flying hoofs once more at mr elders we pitched them out without ceremony and drove home as fast as possible trying to fancy what punishment we would receive for being out so late miriam suggested as the most horrible one being sent to bed supperless annas terror was the generals displeasure i suggested being deprived of rides in future when all agreed that mine was the most severe yet so as we drove around the circle those two set up what was meant for a hearty laugh to show they were not afraid which however sounded rather shaky to me i dont think any of us felt like facing the elders miriam suggested anticipating our fate by retiring voluntarily to bed anna thought we had best run up and change our shoes anyway but at last with her daredevil laugh miriam sauntered into the room where they all were followed by us and thrusting her wet feet into the fire that was kindled to drive away the damp followed also by us commenced a laughable account of our fun in which we of course followed too if i had fancied we were to escape scot free we would most surely have got a scolding it is almost an inducement to hope always for the worst the general did not mention the hour did not prohibit future rides while we were yet toasting a negro came in with what seemed a banknote and asked his master to see how much it was as one of the women had sold some of her watermelons to the three soldiers of the morning who had given that to her for a dollar the general opened it it was a pass so vanish all faith in human nature they looked so honest i could never have believed it of them but it looked so much like the shinplasters we are forced to use that no wonder they made the mistake to discover who had played so mean a trick on the poor old woman the general asked me if i could decipher the name i threw myself on my knees by the hearth and by the flickering light read s kimes by order of c h luzenberg provost marshal onolona miss with a gasp of astonishment that raised a burst of laughter against me thought he was taken prisoner long ago at all events i did nt know he had turned banker or that his valuable autograph was worth a dollar miriam and mother are going to baton rouge in a few hours to see if anything can be saved from the general wreck from the reports of the removal of the penitentiary machinery state library washington statue etc we presume that that part of the town yet standing is to be burnt like the rest i think though that mother has delayed too long however i dreamed last night that we had saved a great deal in trunks and my dreams sometimes come true waking with that impression i was surprised a few hours after to hear mothers sudden determination but i also dreamed i was about to marry a federal officer that was in consequence of having answered the question whether i would do so with an emphatic yes if i loved him which will probably ruin my reputation as a patriot in this parish bah i am no bigot or fool either yesterday anna and i spent the day with lilly and the rain in the evening obliged us to stay all night dr perkins stopped there and repeated the same old stories we have been hearing about the powder placed under the state house and garrison to blow them up if forced to evacuate the town he confirms the story about all the convicts being set free and the town being pillaged by the negroes and the rest of the yankees he says his own slaves told him they were allowed to enter the houses and help themselves and what they did not want the yankees either destroyed on the spot or had it carried to the garrison and burned they also bragged of having stopped ladies on the street cut their necklaces from their necks and stripped the rings from their fingers without hesitation it may be that they were just bragging to look great in the eyes of their masters i hope so for heaven help them if they fall into the hands of the confederates if it is true i could not record all the stories of wanton destruction that reached us i would rather not believe that the federal government could be so disgraced by its own soldiers dr day says they left nothing at all in his house and carried everything off from dr enderss he does not believe we have a single article left in ours i hope they spared miriams piano but they say the soldiers had so many that they offered them for sale at five dollars apiece we heard that the town had been completely evacuated and all had gone to new orleans except three gunboats that were preparing to shell before leaving this morning witherss battery passed mr elders on their way to port hudson and stopped to get water there were several buckets served by several servants but i took possession of one to their great amusement what a profusion of thanks over a can of water it made me smile and they smiled to see my work so it was all very funny it was astonishing to see the number of yankee canteens in the possession of our men almost all those who fought at baton rouge are provided with them in their canvas and wire cases with neat stoppers they are easily distinguished from our rough flat tin ones i declare i felt ever so important in my new situation as waitingmaid there is very little we would not do for our soldiers though there is mother for instance who got on her knees to bathe the face and hands of a feverstruck soldier of the arkansas while the girls held the plates of those who were too weak to hold them and eat at the same time blessed is the confederate soldier who has even toothache when there are women near what sympathies and remedies are volunteered i always laugh as i did then when i think of the supposed wounded man those girls discovered on that memorable arkansas day i must first acknowledge that it was my fault for seized with compassion for a man supported by two others who headed the procession i cried oh look he is wounded oh poor fellow screamed the others while tears and exclamations flowed abundantly until one of the men smiling humorously cried out nothing the matter with him and on nearer view i perceived it was laziness or perhaps something else and was forced to laugh at the streaming eyes of those tenderhearted girls soon after dinner yesterday two soldiers stopped here and requested permission to remain all night the word soldier was enough for us and without even seeing them anna and i gladly surrendered our room and said we would sleep in mrs badgers instead however i had no curiosity to see the heroes and remained up here reading until the bell summoned me to supper when i took my seat without looking at them as no introduction was possible from their having refrained from giving their names presently i heard the words that retreat from norfolk was badly conducted i looked up and saw before me a rather goodlooking man covered with the greatest profusion of gold cloth and buttons for which i intuitively despised him the impulse seized me so i spoke were you there no but near by i was there with the first louisiana for most a year do you know george morgan know george yes indeed you are his sister this was an assertion but i bowed assent and he went on thought so from the resemblance i remember seeing you ten years ago when you were a very little girl i used to be at your house with the boys we were schoolmates i remarked that i had no recollection of him of course not he said but did not inform me of his name he talked very familiarly of the boys and said he had met them all at richmond next he astounded me by saying he was a citizen of baton rouge though he had been almost four years in new york before the war broke out he was going to town to look after the property hearing his father had gone to france an inhabitant of that city who was so familiar with my brothers and me and with whom i was not acquainted here was a riddle to solve let us see who among our acquaintances had gone to france i could think of none i made up my mind to find out his name if i had to ask it all through supper he talked and when in country style the gentlemen left us at table i found the curiosity of the others was even more excited than mine i was determined to know who he was then in the parlor he made some remark about never having been in ladies society the whole time he was in virginia i expressed my surprise as george often wrote of the pleasant young ladies he met everywhere oh yes said monsieur but it is impossible to do your duty as an officer and be a ladys man so i devoted myself to my military profession exclusively insufferable puppy i said to myself then he told me of how his father thought he was dead and asked if i had heard of his rallying twenty men at manassas and charging a federal regiment which instantly broke i honestly told him no iagoo the great boaster i decided abruptly he said there were very few nice young ladies in baton rouge probably so in his circle i thought while i dryly remarked indeed oh yes and still more abruptly he said aint you the youngest yes i thought so i remember you when you were a wee thing so high placing his hand at a most insultingly short distance from the floor really i must ask your name i said he hesitated a moment and then said in a low tone de j de what i absurdly asked thinking i was mistaken a de j he repeated i bowed slightly to express my satisfaction said anna we must retire and with a goodnight to my newly discovered gentleman went upstairs he is the one i heard george speak of last december when he was here as having been courtmartialed and shot according to the universal belief in the army that was the only time i had ever heard his name though i was quite familiar with the cart of de j pre as it perambulated the streets my first impressions are seldom erroneous from the first i knew that mans respectability was derived from his buttons that is why he took such pride in them and contemplated them with such satisfaction they lent him social backbone enough to converse so familiarly with me without the effulgence of that splendid gold which he hoped would dazzle my eye to his real position he would have hardly dared to remember me when i was a wee thing so high is he the only man whose coat alone entitles him to respectability he may be colonel for all i know but still he is a de j to me he talked brave enough to be general this morning i met him with a cordial goodmorning mr de j anxious to atone for several snubs i had given him long before i knew his name last night you see i could afford to be patronizing now but the name probably and the fluency with which i pronounced it proved too much for him and after goodmorning miss morgan he did not venture a word we knew each other then his name was no longer a secret sleep is impossible after all that i have heard so after vainly endeavoring to follow the example of the rest and sleep like a stoic i have lighted my candle and take to this to induce drowsiness just after supper when anna and i were sitting with mrs carter in her room i talking as usual of home and saying i would be perfectly happy if mother would decide to remain in baton rouge and brave the occasional shellings i heard a wellknown voice take up some sentence of mine from a dark part of the room and with a cry of surprise i was hugging miriam until she was breathless such a forlorn creature so dirty tired and fatigued as to be hardly recognizable we thrust her into a chair and made her speak she had just come with charlie who went after them yesterday and had left mother and the servants at a kind friends on the road i never heard such a story as she told i was heartsick but i laughed until mrs badger grew furious with me and the yankees and abused me for not abusing them she says when she entered the house she burst into tears at the desolation it was one scene of ruin libraries emptied china smashed sideboards split open with axes three cedar chests cut open plundered and set up on end all parlor ornaments carried off even the alabaster apollo and diana that hal valued so much her piano dragged to the centre of the parlor had been abandoned as too heavy to carry off her desk lay open with all letters and notes well thumbed and scattered around while wills last letter to her was open on the floor with the yankee stamp of dirty fingers mothers portrait halfcut from its frame stood on the floor margret who was present at the sacking told how she had saved fathers it seems that those who wrought destruction in our house were all officers one jumped on the sofa to cut the picture down miriam saw the prints of his muddy feet when margret cried for gods sake gentlemen let it be ill help you to anything here hes dead and the young ladies would rather see the house burn than lose it ill blow your damned brains out was the gentlemans answer as he put a pistol to her head which a brother officer dashed away and the picture was abandoned for finer sport all the others were cut up in shreds upstairs was the finest fun mothers beautiful mahogany armoir whose single door was an extremely fine mirror was entered by crashing through the glass when it was emptied of every article and the shelves halfsplit and halfthrust back crooked letters labeled by the boys private were strewn over the floor they opened every armoir and drawer collected every rag to be found and littered the whole house with them until the wonder was where so many rags had been found fathers armoir was relieved of everything gibbess handsome damascus sword with the silver scabbard included all his clothes georges hals jimmys were appropriated they entered my room broke that fine mirror for sport pulled down the rods from the bed and with them pulverized my toilet set taking also all lydias china ornaments i had packed in the washstand the dbris filled my basin and ornamented my bed my desk was broken open over it was spread all my letters and private papers a diary i kept when twelve years old and sundry tokens of dried roses etc which must have been very funny they all being labeled with the donors name and the occasion fool how i writhe when i think of all they saw the invitations to buggy rides concerts compliments of etc lillys sewingmachine had disappeared but as mothers was too heavy to move they merely smashed the needles in the pillaging of the armoirs they seized a pink flounced muslin of miriams which one officer placed on the end of a bayonet and paraded round with followed by the others who slashed it with their swords crying i have stuck the damned secesh thats the time i cut her and continued their sport until the rags could no longer be pierced one seized my bonnet with which he decked himself and ran in the streets indeed all who found such rushed frantically around town by way of frolicking with the things on their heads they say no frenzy could surpass it another snatched one of my calico dresses and a pair of vases that mother had when she was married and was about to decamp when a mrs jones jerked them away and carried them to her boardinghouse and returned them to mother the other day blessed be heaven i have a calico dress our clothes were used for the vilest purposes and spread in every corner at least those few that were not stolen aunt barkers charles tried his best to defend the property aint you shamed to destroy all dis here that belongs to a poor widow lady whos got two daughters to support he asked of an officer who was foremost in the destruction poor damn them i dont know when i have seen a house furnished like this look at that furniture they poor was the retort and thereupon the work went bravely on of making us poor indeed it would have fared badly with us had we been there the servants say they broke into the house crying where are those damned secesh women we know they are hid in here and we ll make them dance for hiding from federal officers and they could not be convinced that we were not there until they had searched the very garret wonder what they would have done charles caught a captain clark in the streets when the work was almost over and begged him to put an end to it the gentleman went readily but though the devastation was quite evident no one was to be seen and he was about to leave when insisting that there was some one there charles drew him into my room dived under the bed and drew from thence a yankee captain by one leg followed by a lieutenant each with a bundle of the boys clothes which they instantly dropped protesting they were only looking around the house the gentleman captain carried them off to their superior ours was the most shockingly treated house in the whole town we have the misfortune to be equally feared by both sides because we will blackguard neither so the yankees selected the only house in town that sheltered three forlorn women to wreak their vengeance on from far and near strangers and friends flocked in to see the ravages committed crowds rushed in before crowds came in after miriam and mother arrived all apologizing for the intrusion but saying they had heard it was a sight never before seen so they let them examine to their hearts content and miriam says the sympathy of all was extraordinary a strange gentleman picked up a piece of mothers mirror which was as thick as his finger saying madame i should like to keep this as a memento i am about to travel through mississippi and having seen what a splendid piece of furniture this was and the state your house is left in should like to show this as a specimen of yankee vandalism william waller flew to our home to try to save it but was too late they say he burst into tears as he looked around while on his kind errand another band of yankees burst into his house and left not one article of clothing to him except the suit he had on the whole talk is about our dreadful treatment at the yankees hands dr day and dr enders in spite of the assertions of the former lost nothing well i am beggared strange to say i dont feel it perhaps it is the satisfaction of knowing my fate that makes me so cheerful that mrs carter envied my stoicism while mrs badger felt like beating me because i did not agree that there was no such thing as a gentleman in the yankee army i know major drum for one and that captain clark must be two and mr biddle is three and general williams god bless him wherever he is for he certainly acted like a christian the yankees boasted loudly that if it had not been for him the work would have been done long ago and now i am determined to see my home before yankee shells complete the work that yankee axes spared so by sunrise i shall post over to mr elders and insist on charlie taking me to town with him i hardly think it is many hours off i feel so settled so calm just as though i never meant to sleep again if i only had a desk a luxury i have not enjoyed since i left home i could write for hours still without being sleepy but this curved attitude is hard on my stiff back so goodnight while i lie down to gain strength for a sight they say will make me faint with distress nous verrons if i say i wont i know i ll not cry the brunots lost nothing at all from their house thank heaven for the mercy only they lost all their money in their flight on the door on their return they found written ladies i have done my best for you signed by a yankee soldier who they suppose to be the one who has made it a habit of continually passing their house forgot to say miriam recovered my guitar from the asylum our large trunk and fathers papers untouched from dr enderss and with her piano the two portraits a few mattresses all that is left of housekeeping affairs and fathers law books carried them out of town for which i say in all humility blessed be god who has spared us so much i am satisfied i have seen my home again tuesday i was up at sunrise and my few preparations were soon completed and before any one was awake i walked over to mr elders through mud and dew to meet charlie fortunate was it for me that i started so early for i found him hastily eating his breakfast and ready to leave he was very much opposed to my going and for some time i was afraid he would force me to remain but at last he consented perhaps because i did not insist and with wet feet and without a particle of breakfast i at length found myself in the buggy on the road home the ride afforded me a series of surprises half the time i found myself halfway out of the little lownecked buggy when i thought i was safely in and the other half i was surprised to find myself really in when i thought i was wholly out and so on for mile after mile over muddy roads until we came to a most terrific crossroad where we were obliged to pass and which is best undescribed four miles from town we stopped at mrs browns to see mother and after a few moments talk went on our road i saw the first yankee camp that will pinckney and colonel bird had set fire to the day of the battle such a shocking sight of charred wood burnt clothes tents and all imaginable articles strewn around i had never before seen i should have been very much excited entering the town by the route our soldiers took but i was not it all seemed tame and familiar i could hardly fancy i stood on the very spot where the severest struggle had taken place the next turn of the road brought us to two graves one on each side of the road the restingplace of two who fell that day they were merely left in the ditch where they fell and earth from the side was pulled over them when miriam passed parts of their coats were sticking out of the grave but some kind hand had scattered fresh earth over them when i saw them beyond the sight became more common i was told that their hands and feet were visible from many and one poor fellow lay unburied just as he had fallen with his horse across him and both skeletons that sight i was spared as the road near which he was iying was blocked up by trees so we were forced to go through the woods to enter instead of passing by the catholic graveyard in the woods we passed another camp our men destroyed while the torn branches above testified to the number of shells our men had braved to do the work next to mr barbees were the remains of a third camp that was burned and a few more steps made me suddenly hold my breath for just before us lay a dead horse with the flesh still hanging which was hardly endurable close by lay a skeleton whether of man or horse i did not wait to see not a human being appeared until we reached the penitentiary which was occupied by our men after that i saw crowds of wagons moving furniture out but not a creature that i knew just back of our house was all that remained of a nice brick cottage namely four crumbling walls the offense was that the husband was fighting for the confederates so the wife was made to suffer and is now homeless like many thousands besides it really seems as though god wanted to spare our homes the frame dwellings adjoining were not touched even the town was hardly recognizable and required some skill to avoid the corners blocked up by trees so as to get in at all our house could not be reached by the front so we left the buggy in the back yard and running through the lot without stopping to examine the storeroom and servants rooms that opened wide i went through the alley and entered by the front door fortunate was it for this record that i undertook to describe the sacking only from miriams account if i had waited until now it would never have been mentioned for as i looked around to attempt such a thing seemed absurd i stood in the parlor in silent amazement and in answer to charlies well i could only laugh it was so hard to realize as i looked for each wellknown article i could hardly believe that abraham lincolns officers had really come so low down as to steal in such a wholesale manner the papiermach workbox miriam had given me was gone the baby sacque i was crocheting with all knitting needles and wools gone also of all the beautiful engravings of annapolis that will pinckney had sent me there remained a single one gentlemen my name is written on each not a book remained in the parlor except idyls of the king that contained my name also and which together with the doorplate was the only case in which the name of morgan was spared they must have thought we were related to john morgan and wreaked their vengeance on us for that reason thanks for the honor but there is not the slightest connection where they did not carry off articles bearing our name they cut it off as in the visitingcards and left only the first name every book of any value or interest except hume and gibbon was borrowed permanently i regretted macaulay more than all the rest brothers splendid french histories went too all except lhistoire de la bastille however as they spared fathers law libraries all except one volume they used to support a flour barrel with while they emptied it near the parlor door we ought to be thankful the diningroom was very funny i looked around for the cutglass celery and preserve dishes that were to be part of my dot as mother always said together with the champagne glasses that had figured on the table the day that i was born but there remained nothing there was plenty of splitup furniture though i stood in mothers room before the shattered armoir which i could hardly believe the same that i had smoothed my hair before as i left home three weeks previously fathers was split across and the lock torn off and in the place of the hundreds of articles it contained i saw two bonnets at the sight of which i actually sat down to laugh one was mothers velvet which looked very much like a football in its present condition mine was not to be found as the officers forgot to return it wonder who has my imperial i know they never saw a handsomer one with its black velvet purple silk and ostrich feathers i went to my room gone was my small paradise had this shocking place ever been habitable the tall mirror squinted at me from a thousand broken angles it looked so knowing i tried to fancy the yankee officers being dragged from under my bed by the leg thanks to charles but it seemed too absurd so i let them alone my desk what a sight the central part i had kept as a little curiosity shop with all my little trinkets and keepsakes of which a large proportion were from my gentlemen friends i looked for all i had left found only a piece of the mcrae which as it was labeled in full i was surprised they had spared precious letters i found under heaps of broken china and rags all my notes were gone with many letters i looked for a letter of poor in cipher with the key attached and name signed in plain hand i knew it would hardly be agreeable to him to have it read and it certainly would be unpleasant to me to have it published but i could not find it miriam thinks she saw something answering the description somewhere though nbsp bah what is the use of describing such a scene many suffered along with us though none so severely indeed the yankees cursed loudly at those who did not leave anything worth stealing they cannot complain of us on that score all our handsome brussels carpets together with lydias fur were taken too what did they not take in the garret in its darkest corner a whole giltedged china set of lydias had been overlooked so i set to work and packed it up while charlie packed her furniture in a wagon to send to her father it was now three oclock and with my light linen dress thrown off i was standing over a barrel putting in cups and saucers as fast as i could wrap them in the rags that covered the floor when mr larguier sent me a nice little dinner i had been so many hours without eating nineteen i think during three of which i had slept that i had lost all appetite but nevertheless i ate it to show my appreciation if i should here after think that the quantity of rags was exaggerated let me here state that after i had packed the barrel and china with them it made no perceptible diminution of the pile as soon as i had finished my task charlie was ready to leave again so i left town without seeing or hearing any one or any thing except what lay in my path as we drove out of the gate i begged charlie to let me get my bird as i heard charles barker had him a man was dispatched and in a few minutes returned with my jimmy i have since heard that tiche deserted him the day of the battle as i so much feared she would and that charles found him late in the evening and took charge of him with my pet once more with me we drove off again i cast many a longing look at the graveyard but knowing charlie did not want to stop i said nothing though i had been there but once in three months and that once six weeks ago i could see where the fence had been thrown down by our soldiers as they charged the federals but it was now replaced though many a picket was gone once more i stopped at mrs browns while charlie went on to clinton leaving me to drive mother here in the morning early yesterday after seeing miriams piano and the mattresses packed up and on the road we started off in the buggy and after a tedious ride through a melting sun arrived here about three oclock having again missed my dinner which i kept a profound secret until suppertime by next ash wednesday i will have learned how to fast without getting sick though very tired i sat sewing until after sunset dictating a page and a half to anna who was writing to howell noahs duck has found another restingplace yesterday i was interrupted while writing to pack up for another move it being impossible to find a boardinghouse in the neighborhood we heard of some about here and charlie had engaged a house for his family where the servants were already settled so i hurried off to my task no easy one either considering the heat and length of time allowed this time i ate dinner as i packed again about four finding miriam did not come to mr elders as she promised i started over to general carters with her clothes and found her just getting into the buggy to ride over as i arrived warm tired hardly able to stand after taking her over the general sent the buggy back for mrs carter and myself and soon we were all assembled waiting for the cars at last determining to wait for them near the track we started off again general carter driving me in his buggy i love general carter again after so many kind invitations he told me he was sorry we would not remain with him if we were content he would be only too happy to have us with him and spoke so kindly that i felt as though i had a yankee ball in my throat i was disposed to be melancholy anyway i could not say many words without choking i was going from the kindest of friends to a country where i had none at all so could not feel very gay as we reached the track the cars came shrieking along there was a pause a scufffle during which the general placed me and my bird in a seat while lilly charlie miriam mother five children and two servants with all the baggage were thrown aboard some way when with a shriek and a jerk we were off again without a chance of saying goodbye even i enjoyed that ride it had but one fault and that was that it came to an end i would have wished it to spin along until the war was over or we in a settled home but it ended at last to jimmys great relief for he was too frightened to move even and only ventured a timid chirp if the car stopped as if to ask is it over nothing occurred of any interest except once a little boy sent us slightly off the track by meddling with the brakes landed at sunset it is hard to fancy a more forlorn crew while waiting at the depot to get the baggage off before coming to the house we burst out laughing as we looked at each lengthened face such a procession through the straggling village has hardly been seen before how we laughed at our forlorn plight as we trudged through the hilly streets they have no pavements here looking like emigrants from the ould counthry as we have watched them in new orleans at the house we found tiche laid up the loaded wagon with its baggage four mules three grown servants and four children was precipitated from a bridge twentyfive feet high by the breaking of the beforementioned causeway and landed with the whole concern in deep water below wonderful to relate not a life was lost the mattress on which the negroes remained seated floated them off into shallow water the only one hurt was tiche who had her leg severely sprained the baggage was afterwards fished out rather wet in the mud next morning it happened late at night dophy found a tiny fancy bottle that she had secreted from the yankees a present from clemmy luzenberg it was and one of two things left in my curiosity shop by the yankees after seeing everything in we started off for the hotel where we arrived after dark rather tired i think not a comfortable house either unless you call a bare unfurnished dirty room without shutter or anything else comfortable particularly when you are to sleep on the floor with four children and three grown people and a servant after breakfast we came here until we can find a place to settle in which mr marsden has promised to attend to for us it is rather rough housekeeping yet but lilly has not yet got settled our dinner was rather primitive there was a knife and fork to carve the meat and then it was finished with spoons i sat on the floor with my plate and a piece of cornbread flour not to be bought at any price and ate with my fingers a new experience i found that water can be drunk out of a cup ouf i am tired still no prospect of a lodging so here we remain i never before lived in a house without a balcony and have only now found out how inconvenient it is the whole establishment consists of two rooms on each side of a passage as wide as the front door and as it has a very low ceiling with no opening and no shade near it is decidedly the warmest spot i ever inhabited we all sleep on the floor and keep our clothes in our trunks except lilly who has an armoir without doors knives and forks for dinner today though the table still consists of a single plank the house really has a suffocating effect on me there is such a close look about it the front is fully a foot below the level of the street while quite a flight of steps leads from the back door to the yard in fact the whole town consists of abrupt little mounds it is rather a pretty place but heaven save me from the misery of living in it miriam is crazy to remain even advocates that dirty bare shutterless boardinghouse where we passed the first night from what attraction i cannot imagine i am just as anxious to get into the country i would hate the dull round of this little place i prefer solitude where i can do as i please without being observed here we are as well known by people we never before heard of as though we were fellowcitizens i woke up this morning and to my great surprise find that summer has already passed away and that we have already entered the first month of fall where has the summer gone to since the taking of fort jackson the days have gone by like a dream i had hardly realized spring when now i find it is autumn i am content to let the time fly though as every day brings us nearer peace or something else how shockingly i write will i ever again have a desk or a table to write on at present my seat is a mattress and my knee my desk and that is about the only one i have had since the 2d of august this is the dreariest day i have seen for some time outside it has been raining since daybreak and inside no one feels especially bright or cheerful i sometimes wish mother would carry out her threat and brave the occasional shellings at baton rouge i would dare anything to be at home again i know that the yankees have left us little besides the bare house but i would be grateful for the mere shelter of the roof i often fancy how we will miss little articles that we thought necessary to our comfort before when we return and the shoes i paid five dollars for and wore a single time i am wishing i had them now that i am almost barefooted and cannot find a pair in the whole country would it not be curious if one of these days while traveling in the north if i ever travel again i should find some wellloved object figuring in a strange house as a trophy of the battle of baton rouge i should have to seek for them in some very low house perhaps respectable people had very little to do with such disgraceful work i fancy suppose i should see fathers cigarstand for instance or miriams little statues i wonder if the people would have the conscience to offer to return them a young lady passing by one of the pillaged houses expressed her surprise at seeing an armoir full of womens and childrens clothes being emptied and the contents tied up in sheets what can you do with such things she asked a soldier who seemed more zealous than the rest aint i got a wife and four children in the north was the answer so we who have hardly clothes enough for our own use are stripped to supply northerners one would think that i had no theme save the wreck of our house if they read this but i take it all out in here i believe i must be made of wood or some other tough material not to feel it more i sometimes ask myself if it is because i did not care for home that i take it so quietly now but i know that is not it i was wild about it before i knew what had happened since i learned all few are the words that have escaped my lips concerning it perhaps it is because i have the satisfaction of knowing what all women crave for the worst indeed it is a consolation in such days as these when truth concerning either side is difficult to discover the certainty of anything fortune or misfortune is comfort to me i really feel sorry for the others who suffered but it does not strike me that sympathy is necessary in our case mrs flynn came to lillys room when she heard of it well prepared for sympathy with a large handkerchief and a profusion of tears when she was horrified to find both her and miriam laughing over the latters description of some comical scene that met her sight in one of the rooms seems to me that tears on all occasions come in as the fortieth article to the articles of belief of some people political news it would be absurd to record for our information is more than limited being frequently represented by a blank of the thirteen battles that gibbes has fought in i know the names of four only bull run stonebridge port republic and cedar run think of all i have yet to hear today comes the news of another grand affair the defeat of mcclellan pope and burnside combined if i dared believe it but accounts are too meagre as yet both gibbes and george were in it if there was a fight and perhaps jimmy too well i must wait in patience we have lost so much already that god will surely spare those three to us oh if they come again if we can meet once more what will the troubles of the last six months signify if i dared hope that next summer would bring us peace i always prophesy it just six months off but do i believe it indeed i dont know what will become of us if it is delayed much longer if we could only get home it would be another thing but boarding how long will mothers two hundred and fifty last and that is all the money she has as to the claims amounting to a small fortune she might as well burn them they will never be paid but if we get home what will we do for bedding the yankees did not leave us a single comfort and only two old bars and a pair of ragged sheets which articles are not to be replaced at any price in the confederacy so we must go without how glad i am that we gave all our blankets to our soldiers last summer so much saved from the yankees poor lavinia she fancies us comfortably settled at home i dare say she spends all her time in picturing to herself what we may be doing and recalling each piece of furniture the rooms contained wonder if she would not be shocked if the real scene were suddenly revealed to her and she should see the desolated house and see us fugitives in a strange town wonder how the cry of where are those three damned secesh women would have struck her had she heard the strange oaths and seen the eager search which followed i dare say it would have frightened her more than it did me when i was told of it william waller says it is gods mercy that we had escaped already for we certainly would have suffered i hardly think we could have been harmed though and shall always regret that we did not return immediately after the battle it took them from that day to the evacuation to finish the work and i rather think that our presence would have protected the house our servants they kindly made free and told them they must follow them the officers margret was boasting the other day of her answer i dont want to be any freeer than i is now ill stay with my mistress when tiche shrewdly remarked pshaw dont you know that if i had gone youd have followed me the conduct of all our servants is beyond praise five thousand negroes followed their yankee brothers from the town and neighborhood but ours remained during the fight or flight rather a fleeing officer stopped to throw a musket in charles barkers hands and bade him fight for his liberty charles drew himself up saying i am only a slave but i am a secesh nigger and wont fight in such a d crew exit yankee continuing his flight down to the riverside i hear today that the brunots have returned to baton rouge determined to await the grand finale there they and two other families alone remain with these exceptions and a few dutch and irish who cannot leave the town is perfectly deserted by all except the confederate soldiers i wish i was with them if all chance of finding lodgings here is lost and mother remains with lilly as she sometimes seems more than half inclined and miriam goes to linwood as she frequently threatens i believe i will take a notion too and go to mrs brunot i would rather be there in all the uncertainty expecting to be shelled or burnt out every hour than here ouf what a country next time i go shopping i mean to ask some clerk out of curiosity what they do sell in clinton the following is a list of a few of the articles that shopkeepers actually laugh at you if you ask for glasses flour soap starch coffee candles matches shoes combs guitarstrings birdseed in short everything that i have heretofore considered as necessary to existence if any one had told me i could have lived off of cornbread a few months ago i would have been incredulous now i believe it and return an inward grace for the blessing at every mouthful i have not tasted a piece of wheatbread since i left home and shall hardly taste it again until the war is over i do not like this small burg it is very straggling and pretty but i would rather not inhabit it we are as well known here as though we carried our cards on our faces and it is peculiarly disagreeable to me to overhear myself spoken about by people i dont know as there goes miss morgan as that young man for instance remarked this morning to a crowd just as i passed it is not polite to say the least will carter was here this morning and told me he saw theodore pinckney in the streets i suppose he is on his way home and think he will be a little disappointed in not finding us at linwood as he expects and still more so to hear he passed through the very town where we were staying without knowing it another perch for noahs duck where will i be in a week or two from this i shall make a mark twenty pages from here and see where i shall be when i reach it here most probably but oh if i could then be at home general carter who spent the evening with us day before yesterday remarked that the first thing he heard as he reached town was that all the gentlemen and ladies of clinton were hunting for country lodgings for us it was pretty much the case the general was as kind as ever bless his gray head and made us promise to go back to linwood with him when he passes back next week this is the way we keep the promise coming out here early yesterday morning we received a note from eliza haynes one of our indefatigable agents saying her grandmother mrs mccay had consented to receive us and would come for us in the evening immediately my packing task was begun but imagine my disappointment just as i had finished one trunk to hear mother announce her determination to let us go alone while she remained with lilly prayers entreaties tears arguments all failed and we were forced to submit so with a heart fuller than i can express i repacked the trunk with miriams and my clothing and got ready to depart in the evening the carriage drove up to the door with eliza and her grandmother and with a hasty and rather choky goodbye to lilly and mother we were hurried in and in another moment were off i fancied the house would be north of clinton so of course the horses took the road south then i decided on a white cottage to the left of the road and about two miles out found that it was to the right not painted and no cottage at all but a nondescript building besides t was ever thus from childhoods hour when did i ever fancy anything exactly as it was but the appearance does not affect the house which is really very comfortable though apparently unfinished the same objection might be made to it that i made to mrs moores for there is not a shutter on the place but fine shade trees take their place and here i do not feel the want of them so much as our room is in the back of the house to the west where the rising sun cannot salute my nose as it did at mrs moores as to what effect the setting sun has i must wait for the evening to decide though i always enjoy that at greenwell we used to walk a mile away from home to see the sun set in an open field i find mrs mccay an excellent plain old lady with neither airs nor pretentions and very kindhearted here she lives alone with the exception of an orphan girl called jane whose position halfmenial halfequal it would be hard to define poor girl the name of orphan alone was enough to make me sorry for her she must be fridays child she is so ready and willing eliza who it seems stays a great deal with her grandmother is one of the brightest little girls i have seen for a long while she sings and plays on the piano with a style and assurance that i can only mutely covet why cannot i have the confidence i see all others possess she took me to the ginhouse last evening though i could not see much as it was almost sunset when we arrived an early tea and singing and music after completed our evening and then we were shown to our room mrs mccay has only room for us two so it is fortunate that mother would not come she says she wants us to spend a few days with her to see if we like it or if we will be willing to be separated from mother in the mean time we can look around for lodgings in a larger and more comfortable place where we can be together she tells such stories about the house lilly lives in of its age and unhealthiness that i am frightened about mother she says she will die if she stays there this month miriam and eliza have gone to town to see them and are then going to mrs georges to see if she can accommodate us i wanted to have a splendid dream last night but failed it was pleasant though to dream of welcoming george and gibbes back jimmy i could not see and george was in deep mourning i dreamed of fainting when i saw him a novel sensation since i never experienced it awake but i speedily came to and insisted on his pulling henry walshs red hair for his insolence which he promised to do instantly how absurd dreams dreams that pathetic miss sarah do you ever dream comes vividly back to me sometimes dream dont i not the dreams that he meant but royal purple dreams that de quincey could not purchase with his opium dreams that i would not forego for all the inducements that could be offered i go to sleep and pay a visit to heaven or fairyland i have white wings and with another float in rosy clouds and look down on the moving world or i have the power to raise myself in the air without wings and silently float wherever i will loving all things and feeling that god loves me i have heard paul preach to the people while i stood on a fearful rock above i have been to strange lands and great cities i have talked with people i have never beheld charlotte bront has spent a week with me in my dreams and together we have talked of her sad life shakespeare and i have discussed his works seated ttette over a small table he pointed out the character of each of his heroines explaining what i could not understand when awake and closed the lecture with you have the tenderest heart i have ever read or sung of which compliment considering it as original with him rather than myself waked me up with surprise back again for how long i know not at sunset saturday eliza and miriam returned to mrs mccays with nannie davidson mother had proved obdurate and refused to leave clinton so they had all gone on and spent the day with mrs haynes instead of going to mrs georges after my quiet solitary day i was glad to see them again particularly as they brought confirmation of the great victory in virginia it is said the enemy were cut off from washington and that we were pursuing them o my brothers if god will only spare them i envy lydia who is so near them and knows all and can take care of them if they are hurt it will be several days at least before we can hear from them if we hear at all for jimmy has never yet written a line and george has written but once since the taking of the forts and that was before the battle of chickahominy we can only wait patiently perhaps general carter will bring us news mrs haynes sent a very pressing invitation for us to spend the next day with her so although it was sunday we went i am becoming dreadfully irreligious i have not been to church since mr gierlow went to europe last july it is perfectly shocking but the yankees have kept me running until all pious dispositions have been shaken out of me so they are to blame like heathens we called on miss comstock as we passed through town and spent an hour with her landed at mr hayness we had ample time to look around before he and his wife got back from church here again i found what seems to be the prevailing style of the country widespread doors and windows with neither blinds nor shade trees to keep off the glare of the sun the diningroom was a wide hall where the rising sun shone in your face at breakfast and at dinner being directly overhead seemed to shine in at both ends at once a splendid arrangement for a fire worshiper but i happened to be born in america instead of persia so fail to appreciate it yesterday i was interrupted to undertake a very important task the evening before mother and lilly happened to be in a store where two officers were buying materials for making shirts and volunteered to make them for them which offer they gladly accepted though neither party knew the other they saw that they were friends of charlie so had no scruples about offering their services the gentlemen saw that they were ladies and very kind ones besides so made no difficulty about accepting lilly undertook one of purple merino and i took a dark blue one miriam nominally helped her but her very sore finger did not allow her to do much mother slightly assisted me but i think lilly and i had the best of the task all day we worked and when evening came continued sewing by the light of these miserable homemade candles even then we could not finish but had to get up early this morning as the gentlemen were to leave for port hudson at nine oclock we finished in good time and their appearance recompensed us for our trouble lillys was trimmed with folds of blue from mine around collar cuffs pockets and down the front band while mine was pronounced a chef duvre trimmed with bias folds of tiny red and black plaid with their fresh colors and shining pearl buttons they were really very pretty we sent word that we would be happy to make as many as they chose for themselves or their friends and the eldest with many fears that it was an imposition and we were too good and much more of the same kind left another one with charlie for us we cannot do too much or even enough for our soldiers i believe that is the universal sentiment of the women of the south well but how did we get back here i hardly know it seems to me we are being swayed by some kind of destiny which impels us here or there with neither rhyme nor reason and whether we will or no such homeless aimless purposeless wandering individuals are rarely seen from one hour to another we do not know what is to become of us we talk vaguely of going home when the yankees go away when will that be one day there is not a boat in sight the next two or three stand off from shore to see what is being done ready at the first sight of warlike preparation to burn the town down it is particularly unsafe since the news from virginia when the gunboats started from bayou goula shelling the coast at random and destroying everything that was within reach report says of course we cannot return to our homes when commissioned officers are playing the part of pirates burning plundering and destroying at will with neither law nor reason donaldsonville they burned before i left baton rouge because some fool fired a shotgun at a gunboat some miles above bayou sara they burned while we were at general carters for some equally reasonable excuse the fate of baton rouge hangs on a still more slender thread i would give worlds if it were all over at mrs hayness we remained all night as she sent the carriage back without consulting us monday we came to town and spent the day with lilly how it was i cant say but we came to the conclusion that it was best to quit our then residence and either go back to linwood or to a mrs somebody who offered to take us as boarders we went back to mrs mccays to tell her of our determination and in the morning took leave of her and came back home we hear so much news piece by piece that one would imagine some definite result would follow and bring us peace before long the virginia news after being so great and cheering has suddenly ceased to come no one knows the final result the last report was that we held arlington heights why not washington consequently cincinnati at last accounts lay at our mercy from covington kirby smith had sent over a demand for its surrender in two hours would it not be glorious to avenge new orleans by such a blow but since last night the telegraph is silent news has just come of some nice little affair between our militia in opelousas and the yankees from new orleans in which we gave them a good thrashing besides capturing arms prisoners and ammunition it never rains but it pours is georges favorite proverb with it comes the rumor that the yankees are preparing to evacuate the city if it could be oh if god would only send them back to their own country and leave ours in peace i wish them no greater punishment than that they may be returned to their own homes with the disgrace of their outrages here ever before their eyes that would kill an honest man i am sure i have been so busy making lieutenant bourges shirt that i have not had time to write besides having very little to write about so my industry saved my paper and spared these pages a vast amount of trash i would not let any one touch lieutenant bourges shirt except myself and last evening when i held it up completed the loud praises it received satisfied me it would answer miriam and miss ripley declared it the prettiest ever made it is dark purple merino the bosom i tucked with pleats a quarter of an inch deep all the way up to the collar and stitched a narrow crimson silk braid up the centre to hold it in its place around the collar cuffs pockets and band down the front the red cord runs forming a charming contrast to the dark foundation indeed i devoted the sole article the yankees let fall from my two workboxes a bunch of soutache to the work large white pearl buttons completed the description and my shirt is really as quiet subdued and pretty a one as i ever saw i should first hear the opinion of the owner though if he does not agree with all the others i shall say he has no taste i got a long sweet letter from sophie on friday that made me happy for the whole day they were about leaving for alexandria i was glad to hear they would be out of danger but still i was sorry they were going so far away i have been laying a hundred wild schemes to reach baton rouge and spend a day or two with them which is impossible now sophie writes just as she talks and that means remarkably well so i can at least have the pleasure of corresponding at dr carnals they will be out of the reach of all harm and danger so i ought to rejoice there is one thing in which sophie and i agree and that is in making stonewall jackson our hero talk of beauregard he never had my adoration but stonewall is the greatest man of the age decidedly still no authentic reports of the late battles in virginia i say late referring to those fought two weeks ago from the federal accounts glowing as they usually are i should gather the idea that their rout was complete i cannot imagine why we can hear nothing more from our own side i think my first act on my return home will be to take a cup of coffee and a piece of bread two luxuries of which i have been deprived for a long while miriam vows to devour an unheardof number of biscuits too how many articles we considered as absolutely necessary before have we now been obliged to dispense with nine months of the year i reveled in ice thought it impossible to drink water without it since last november i have tasted it but once and that once by accident and oh yes i caught some hailstones one day at linwood icecream lemonade and sponge cake was my chief diet it was a year last july since i tasted the two first and one since i have seen the last bread i believed necessary to life vegetables senseless the former i never see and i have been forced into cultivating at least a toleration of the latter snap beans i can actually swallow sweet potatoes i really like and one day at dr nolans i bolted a mouthful of tomatoes and afterwards kept my seat with the heroism of a martyr these are the minor trials of war if that were all if coarse distasteful food were the only inconvenience when i think of what lavinia must suffer so far from us and in such ignorance of our condition our trials seem nothing in comparison to hers and think how uneasy brother must be hearing of the battle and not knowing where we fled to for he has not heard of us for almost two months in return we are uneasy about him and sister if new orleans is attacked what will become of them with all those children yesterday miriam determined to go to linwood and consequently i had a severe task of trunkpacking one of my greatest delights however i hate to see any one pack loosely or in a slovenly manner perhaps that is the reason i never let any one do it if i am able to stand this morning was appointed as our day for leaving but i persuaded her to wait until tomorrow in hope that either the general or news from virginia would arrive this evening bless this village it is the meanest place for news that i ever was in not a word can be gathered except what is false or unfounded and they are even tired of that in the last few days talk of baton rouge turning yankee as the report went here of the three or four there who took the oath not one can be compared to some loyal citizens of this small burg why i talked to two gentlemen yesterday who if it were not for the disgrace and danger incurred by bearing the name i should style union men and talked or rather listened to them until my spirits were reduced to the lowest ebb people were shocked at our daring to believe there lived gentlemen and christians in the north i mean those wild fanatics who could only take in one idea at a time and rarely divested their brains of that one to make room for a newer one were shocked at our belief but if they could converse with a few here that i could point out our gnat of common sense would be swallowed by this behemoth of heterodoxy this morning mrs bar miss bernard and a miss mud came to town and surprised us by a most unexpected visit they spent the day with us and have just now driven off on their return home through this drizzly misting evening a while ago a large cavalry company passed at the corner on their way from port hudson to camp moore the report is they raised their hats to us seeing us at the gate and we waved our handkerchiefs in return each with a silent god bless you i am sure as though to prove my charge unjust news comes pouring in note we a few items to see how many will prove false first we have taken baltimore without firing a gun maryland has risen en masse to join our troops longstreet and lee are marching on washington from the rear the louisiana troops are ordered home to defend their own state thank god if it will only bring the boys back then comes tidings of nine gunboats at baton rouge ponchatoula on the railroad taken by yankees camp moore and three batteries ditto not so cheering if that is so clinton lies within reach being thirtyfive miles off leaving much the most valuable portion of our clothing here the yankees will probably appropriate what little they spared us and leave us fairly destitute for we take only summer clothes to linwood i have plenty of underclothes but the other day when i unpacked the large trunk from dr enderss i found i had just two dresses for winter a handsome blue silk i bought just two years ago last spring and one heavy blue merino that does not fit me what an outfit for winter miriam has two poplins and a black silk and mother a winecolored merino only but each of us is blessed with a warm cloak and are correspondingly grateful i was confident i had saved my green dark blue and brown silk dresses but the yankees saved them instead for me or their suffering sweethearts rather on the other hand taking so many necessary articles to linwood the risk of losing them is the same an attack on port hudson is apprehended and if it falls general carters house will be decidedly unsafe from yankee vengeance the probability is that it will burn as they have been daily expecting ever since the yankees occupied baton rouge the risk seems equal either way go or stay the danger seems the same shall we go then for variety or die here of stagnation while waiting for the yankees to make up their minds i would rather be at neither place just now in fact i could hardly name the place i should like to be in now unless it were europe or the sandwich islands but i love linwood and its dear inhabitants and under other circumstances should be only too happy to be there i was regretting the other day that our life was now so monotonous almost longed for the daily alarms we had when under yankee rule in baton rouge stirring times are probably ahead still floating about this morning after breakfast general carter made his appearance and in answer to his question as to whether we were ready to leave with him miriam replied yes indeed heartily glad to get away from clinton where i have detained her ever since the day theodore returned home to her great disgust as our trunk was already packed it did not take many minutes to get ready and in a little while with a protracted goodbye we were on our way to the depot which we reached some time before the cars started though glad to leave clinton i was sorry to part with mother for ten days she has been unable to walk with a sore on her leg below the knee and i want to believe she will miss me while i am away i could not leave my bird in that close illventilated house he has never sung since i recovered him and i attribute his ill health or low spirits to that unhealthy place and thought linwood might be beneficial to him too so brought him with me to see what effect a breath of pure air might have we were the only ladies on the cars except mrs brown who got off halfway but in spite of that had a very pleasant ride as we had very agreeable company the train only stopped thirteen times in the twenty miles five times to clear the brushwood from the telegraph lines once running back a mile to pick up a passenger and so on to the great indignation of many of the passengers aboard who would occasionally cry out hello if this is the clearingup train we had better send for a handcar what the devils the matter now until the general gravely assured them that it was an old habit of this very accommodating train which in summertime stopped whenever the passengers wished to pick blackberries on the road many soldiers were aboard on their way to port hudson to rejoin their companies one gallant one offered me a drink of water from his canteen which i accepted out of mere curiosity to see what water from such a source tasted of to my great surprise i found it tasted just like any other the general introduced a mr crawford to us who took the seat next to me as the one next to miriam was already occupied and proved a very pleasant and talkative compagnon de voyage general carters query as to my industry since he had seen me brought my acknowledgment of having made two shirts one of which i sent yesterday who to was the next question i gave the name adding that i did not know the gentleman and he was under the impression that it was made by mother ill see that he is undeceived cried the general hanged if i dont tell him thirtieth louisiana you say queried mr crawford that is the very one i am going to i will tell him myself so my two zealous champions went on the general ending with see to it crawford mrs morgan shall not have the credit as though there was any great merit in sewing for ones countrymen our new acquaintance handed me from the cars as we reached linwood and stood talking while the accommodating train slowly rolled out its freight he told me he was going to send me a tiny sack of coffee which proposition as it did not meet with the slightest encouragement will of course never be thought of again i noticed too on the train one of the arkansass crew the same who though scarcely able to stand on a severely wounded foot made such a fuss about riding in a carriage while real ladies had to walk of course he did not recognize us any more than we would have known him if dr brown had not pointed him out i hear all of them are at port hudson anna told me as we got here that dr addison the one i disliked because he was so scrupulously neat while the others were dressed or rather undressed for working was here yesterday and inquired for the miss morgans saying they were the most charming young ladies he had ever met on what he founded his opinion or how he happened to inquire for us in this part of the country i cannot imagine the general brings news of the boys from jackson he there met an officer who left stonewall jacksons command on the 2d inst and says gibbes was unhurt god be praised another saw george a week ago in richmond still lame as the cap of his knee had slipped in that fall last spring of jimmy we hear not a word not even as to where he is it seems as though we are destined never to hear again general carter has just received a letter from lydia which contains what to me is the most melancholy intelligence the news of the death of eugene fowler who was killed on the 22d of august in some battle or skirmish in virginia poor eugene does it not seem that this war will sweep off all who are nearest and dearest as well as most worthy of life leaving only those you least care for unharmed after supper last night by way of variety anna miriam and i came up to our room and after undressing commenced popping corn and making candy in the fireplace we had scarcely commenced when three officers were announced who found their way to the house to get some supper they having very little chance of reaching clinton before morning as the cars had run off the track of course we could not appear and they brought bad luck with them for our corn would not pop and our candy burned while to add to our distress the odor of broiled chicken and hot biscuit was wafted upstairs after a while in the most provoking way in vain we sent the most pathetic appeals by each servant for a biscuit apiece after our hard work mrs carter was obdurate until tired out with our messages she at last sent us an empty jellycup a shred of chip beef two polished drumsticks and half a biscuit divided in three with that bountiful repast we were forced to be content and go to bed at sunrise this morning mrs carter left to go down to her father in iberville to see her stepmother who is expected to die scarcely had she gone when six more officers and soldiers came in from the still stationary cars to get their breakfast we heard that mr marsden too was down there so the general sent him a nice breakfast and i sent my love with it but he had already breakfasted at mr elders as soon as they left we prepared for church and just as we were ready captain brown and mr addison were announced the doctor greeted us with an elegant bow but they did not remain long as we were about going out many officers were in church and as i passed out colonel breaux joined me and escorted miriam and me to the carriage where we stood talking some time under the trees before getting in he gave us a most pressing invitation to name a day to visit the camp that he might have the pleasure of showing us the fortifications and we said we would beg the generals permission to do so charming colonel breaux like all nice men he is married of course he and another officer drove just behind our carriage in coming home until we came to the fork of the road then leaning from their buggy both gentlemen bowed profoundly which we as cordially returned two more behind followed their example and to our great surprise ten who were seated in a small wagon drawn by two diminutive mules bowed also and not content with that rose to their feet as the distance between the two roads increased and raised their caps though in the most respectful silence rather queer and i would have said impertinent had they been any others than confederates fighting for us who of course are privileged people yesterday the general saluted us with young ladies if you will ride in a confederate carriage you may go to dress parade this evening now in present phraseology confederate means anything that is rough unfinished unfashionable or poor you hear of confederate dresses which means last years confederate bridle means a rope halter confederate silver a tin cup or spoon confederate flour is corn meal etc in this case the confederate carriage is a jersey wagon with four seats a top of hickory slats covered with leather and the whole drawn by mules we accepted gladly partly for the ride and sight partly to show we were not ashamed of a very comfortable conveyance so with mrs badger as chaperon we went off in grand style i must say i felt rather abashed and wished myself at home as we drove into town and had the gaze of a whole regiment riveted on us but soon the men fell in line and i did not feel so painfully conspicuous i was amused at a contrast near by too there was but one carriage present besides ours though there were half a dozen ladies on horseback this carriage was a very fine one and in it sat three of the ugliest dowdiest worst dressed females i ever saw we three girls sat in our rough carriage as comfortable as could be dressedwell we could not have been dressed better and looking our very best sans mentir i think the confederates were much the most respectable and what a sad sight the fourth louisiana was that was then parading men that had fought at shiloh and baton rouge were barefooted rags was their only uniform for very few possessed a complete suit and those few wore all varieties of colors and cuts hats could be seen of every style and shape from the first ever invented down to the last one purchased evidently some time since yet he who had no shoes looked as happy as he who had and he who had a cap had something to toss up thats all four or five that we knew gathered around our vehicle and talked to us mr heuston told me he heard i had been thrown severely injured had a narrow escape etc was not thrown saddle turned a few steps off we recognized mr scales he would stare very hard at us and if we turned towards him would look quickly the other way as though afraid to meet our gaze presently he gave us an opportunity and we bowed he came forward eagerly blushing deeply and looking very much pleased and shook hands with us and remained some time talking he said he had not heard of our arrival but would call as soon as possible mr talbot had joined breckinridge having seen the last of that parade he invited us to see that of his sailors which was next but it was too far so we turned off to see colonel breauxs a mile away his the thirtieth louisiana is a beautiful encampment on a large open common parade was almost over as we reached there and soon the colonel came to meet us i did not look at the drill i was watching the hundreds of tents it looked like a great many and was wondering how men could live in such places and was trying to fancy what georges or gibbess looked like it was pleasant to watch the barefoot soldiers race around like boys let loose from school tossing caps and chips at two old gray geese that flew in circles around the encampment just as though they had never had more earnest work one grayheaded man stood in the door of his tent while a blackheaded young one danced before him to his own whistle with his arms akimbo altogether it was a very pretty picture but poor men how can they be happy in these tents my mark finds me at linwood though i had not the slightest idea that it would wonder where twenty pages beyond will find me at home i hope and pray though i am as happy here as i could possibly be in any place on earth stirring news from our armies comes pouring in sunday colonel breaux told me of wools defeat and the great number of prisoners cannon and the large supplies of stores and ammunition that we had captured then tuesday we heard of three great battles in maryland the third one still continuing but no particulars of any of them yesterday came tidings of our having recrossed the potomac and today we hear that mcclellans army has been cut to pieces but whether it is the same old fight or a new one i cannot as yet learn for reliable information is not easily obtained in america at this period did i ever record how little truth there was in any of that last clinton news it speaks for itself though not a boat lay at baton rouge camp moore was not even threatened ponchatoula station was burned but the one battery was retaken by our men the same night but still these false reports cannot equal the yankees take for instance the report of the captain of the essex i give general carter as my authority the captain reports having been fired on by a battery of thirtysix large guns at port hudson some weeks ago when he opened fire and silenced them one after the other from the first to the last not a shot from the rebel batteries reached them and not a casualty on their side occurred but the loss of the confederates must have been awful he came within i forget how many yards from the shore and there was not a live man to be seen he did not mention if there were any dead ones now for the other side there were but four guns mounted there at the time shot and shell from those four certainly reached something for one was seen to enter a porthole from whence issued frightful shrieks soon after and it is well known that the essex is so badly injured by something as to be in a sinking condition and only kept afloat by a gunboat lashed on either side if she is uninjured why did she not return and burn natchez as she announced in leaving port hudson where not a live man was to be seen nor a dead one to be found she stopped at mr babins just below dr nolans where she remained the rest of the day after she left being curious to discover the reason of her short stay mr babin walked to the place where she had been and discovered sixteen fresh graves on the bank if they buried them as they did at baton rouge and vicksburg four in a grave how many would they be but granting there were but sixteen would that prove the veracity of the captain poor man perhaps he is related to pope and cannot help himself i often wonder how lies first came into the world and whether those who originate them do not believe them as firmly as any one else would believe truth lying seems to be the common creed of children and servants anna told me of having heard lennice telling the other servants that she knew there were spirits because i often talked to them every morning and evening i walked to the graveyard with a basket of flowers and would sit by fathers and harrys graves and call their spirits to me and they would all fly to me and talk and sing with me for hours until i would tell them goodbye and go home when they would go away too i suppose the ignorant girl having foundation enough from my frequent visits there which were most often alone made up the rest to account for my never seeming to like company out there the fervent good lord with which the tale was received by the other servants and the full credence they gave it might have proved unpleasant if further circulated and i believe some members of the family found it necessary to put an end to it at once and speaking of the graveyard recalls something i heard for the first time last night miriam was telling me that tiche had asked if we knew that mr sparks had visited harrys grave that he had got a basket of flowers from the davidsons and had made their driver carry it for him and the man had told her that after filling the vases with roses and spreading them over the grave he had thrown himself on it with a shriek of despair calling on harry to forgive him that it was only because forced by his father that he had killed him and calling on god to prove that he would give his life gladly to recall harrys the man thought him a raving maniac and fled in terror miriam asked fanny if it was true and she said yes she had gathered the flowers for him herself i saw them there but little knew whose hand had brought them i perceived at once that they were not mine and touched even to tears by so silent an offering from an unknown person i said it is some womans work god bless the hand that laid them there i cannot say how much that little tribute affected me and mr sparks i do not retract the blessing now no god have mercy on him has been my prayer ever since i knew what an awful loss you had caused us god knows that i never even desired this revenge remorse standing over his grave it has ever been god pity and forgive never yet for an instant god pursue and avenge we were roused up at four oclock last night by the arrival of lydia and eugene carter the first from virginia and the second from tennessee and of course there was very little sleep for any of us so anxious were we to hear the news they brought first i learned that gibbes was safe up to the 17th that george in spite of the advice of his surgeon had rejoined stonewall jackson in maryland and jimmy was midshipman on the ironclad palmetto state at charleston how thankful i was to hear that much i need not say lydia said they all three looked remarkably well jimmy handsomer than ever after that news of all kinds came indiscriminately the boys were very anxious about us but had no idea of our misfortunes or whereabouts they believed us still in baton rouge and feared we had been there during the battle lydia only heard of our house having been plundered when she reached alabama so of course they are still ignorant of it they were all very homesick but said that we were their only trouble a few of the cs stories had reached them through brother officers and george swore to make himself understood by those ladies if he ever saw them again a gentleman from coopers wells told lydia that they never tired of repeating their stories to every new arrival and no man was suffered to depart without having heard a few if a gentleman friend of ours or the boys inquired if they knew the miss morgans of baton rouge oh yes would be the answer intimately but you know they have turned yankee received federal officers every day and placed all their property under yankee protection i or my sister as it happened who was retailing the lie meaning mrs s slept in their house when it was surrounded by a yankee guard oh they are perfectly in favor of the yankees and so on think of a common low soldier who stopped for buttermilk somewhere where anna was introducing the subject it is all false anna interrupted the man answered oh miss you dont suppose we believe it we would not believe such stories of any young ladies much less these for if they are true their conduct must have been perfectly disgraceful but though we know these stories to be lies it does not prevent their being discussed in camp lydia saw mr mcg too at lynchburg who sent me his regards poor fellow he says he still has dreams he told her a few but she says they were chiefly about meeting me at a ball when i always treated him with the most freezing coldness the same old nightmare how often he has told me of that same dream that tormented him eighteen months ago he says he often thinks of me now and he still dreams of me dreams are baseless fabrics whose timbers are mere moonbeams apply your own proverb a clatter of hoofs down the road and bent over the windowsill which is my desk my fingers are not presentable with the splattering of this vile pen in consequence of my position two hours yet before sundown so of course i am not dressed they come nearer still now i see them dr addison and mr m i shall not hurry my toilet for them it will take some time to comb my hair too wish i could remain up here it required very little persuasion to induce those gentlemen to stay to supper the other evening and it was quite late before they took their leave dr addison i was very much pleased with and so were all the rest mr m none of us fell desperately in love with he is too nonchalant and indifferent besides having a most peculiar pronunciation which grated harshly on my ears and that no orthography could fully express garb for instance was distorted into gairb yard into yaird airkansas and all such words that i can only imitate by a violent dislocation of my lower jaw that puts anna into convulsions of laughter only she would laugh the same if it was not funny this kentuckian pronunciation grates hairshly on my southern ears miriam addressed herself exclusively to the doctor so i was obliged to confine my attention entirely to neglected mr m in which pious duty i was ably and charitably seconded by the general speaking of the bravery and daring displayed by the southern soldiers during this war mr m mentioned the dangerous spot he had seen us in the first day we went down to the airkansas and said that iying directly across the point from the essex they expected every instant to see one of her shells explode among us and were very uneasy about our position as we did not seem to know the danger i asked him if he had observed anything peculiar among the dozen planters and overseers standing a short distance from us when the captain sent us word that our position was a very dangerous one as they expected the essex to open fire every instant and we had best stand below the levee higher up where we would be safe from shells i noticed that before any of you understood your position every man had disappeared as though by magic now i had noticed that myself when i turned under shelter of the levee our gallant planters were galloping off in the distance while ginnie and i looked and laughed we suddenly found ourselves the sole objects on the horizon the other girls were in the road below going carelessly toward the carriage so we followed having lost sight of the brave representatives of southern chivalry being the last to leave the supposed field of danger to my former remark let me add that there is only one set who take better care for their safety than married women and that set is composed exclusively of the home guard timid girls either through ignorance or fun compose the majority of the brave men that the volunteer service has not absorbed just after sunset yesterday anna and i were walking down the road towards the sugarhouse she reading occasionally from abbotts napoleon and then pausing for me to explain the very difficult passages she could not understand when we suddenly became aware of the approach of a horse and raising our bowed heads beheld colonel breaux and another before us to our infinite surprise and astonishment the colonel sprang from his horse and advanced on foot his companion slowly followed his example and was introduced as captain morrison we adjourned our historical fit for some future period and walked home with the gentlemen miriam did not get back from her excursion to the canepatch until it was quite late when after sitting down a few moments she ran upstairs to change her dress she had just put it on an hour before but nothing would do but she must dress up fine so she put on her handsomest organdie in vain i pointed to my simple pink muslin with a white body that i had worn all day and begged she would not make the contrast between us more striking than ever as i felt i could not change it without exciting remark she was obdurate dressed herself in gorgeous array and as usual i looked like her ladys maid colonel breaux paid my hair the most extravagant compliments he said he could not say his prayers for looking at it in church sunday before last perhaps that is the reason st paul said a woman should not worship in church with her head uncovered but as the yankees stole my bonnet i am reduced to wearing my black straw walkinghat with its curled brim trimmed in black ribbon with golden sheaves of wheat two years ago this fall father threw me a banknote at table and i purchased this with it now it is my only headgear except a sunbonnet before leaving which was not until quite late this evening was named for our ride to the fortifications to our infinite delight as we have dreamed and talked of nothing else for a week a dispatch just received from gibbes from mobile on his way home i am so happy but what can bring him i fear lydia has gone to clinton to meet him at lillys with what extraordinary care we prepared for our ride yesterday one would have thought that some great event was about to take place but in spite of our long toilet we stood ready equipped almost an hour before colonel breaux arrived i was standing in a novel place upon the bannisters looking over the fields to see if he was coming and not seeing him made some impatient exclamation when lo he appeared before me having only been concealed by the woodpile and o my prophetic soul captain morrison was by his side there was quite a cavalcade of us mr carter and his wife mrs badger and mrs worley in two buggies the three boys who of course followed on horseback and the two gentlemen miriam anna and i riding also it was really a very pretty sight when captain morrison and i who took the lead going would reach the top of one of the steep hills and look down on the procession in the hollow below fortunately it was a very cloudy evening for starting at four it would have been very unpleasant to ride that distance with the sun in our faces as we reached the town we heard the loud report of two cannon which caused the elder ladies to halt and suggest the propriety of a return but if it was a gunboat that was the very thing i was anxious to see so we hurried on to the batteries it proved to be only practicing however at the first one we stopped at the crew of the arkansas were drilling after stopping a while there we followed the river to see the batteries below it was delightful to ride on the edge of a high bluff with the muddy mississippi below until you fancied what would be the probable sensation if the horse should plunge down into the waters then it ceased to be so pleasant the great strong animal i rode could have carried me over without a protest on my part for the ridiculous bit in his mouth was by no means suited to his strength and it would require a more powerful arm than mine to supply the deficiency miriam had generously sacrificed her own comfort to give him to me and rode fiery joe instead of her favorite but it was by no means a comfort to me then anna was not reconciled to her pony while i was on such a fine horse until i proposed an exchange and gladly dismounted near an old mill two miles and a half below port hudson as we returned home in leaving the town we lost sight of the buggies as there was no carriage road that might follow the bluff and though there was one just back we never saw our buggies again once following a crescent far below us lay the water battery concealed by the trees that grew by the waters edge looking from where we stood like quite a formidable precipice then still beyond after leaving the river we passed through a camp where the soldiers divided their attention equally between eating their supper and staring at us in the most profound silence then through an old gate down a steep hill past a long line of riflepits a winding road and another camp where more men stared and cooked their supper we came to the last battery but one which lay so far below that it was too late to visit it we returned highly delighted with what we had seen and our pleasant ride it was late when we got back as altogether our ride had been some fifteen miles in length as soon as we could exchange our habits for our evening dresses we rejoined our guests at the suppertable where none of us wanted for an appetite except poor captain morrison who could not be tempted by the dishes we so much relished after supper colonel breaux and i got into a discussion rather he talked while i listened with eyes and ears with all my soul what would i not give for such knowledge he knows everything and can express it all in the clearest purest language though he says he could not speak a word of english at fourteen the discussion commenced by some remark i made about physiognomy he took it up and passed on to phrenology in which he is no great believer from there he touched on the mind and i listened entranced to him presently he asserted that i possessed reasoning faculties which i fear me i very rudely denied you see every moment the painful conviction of my ignorance grew more painful still until it was most humiliating and i repelled it rather as a mockery he described for my benefit the process of reasoning the art of thinking i listened more attentively still resolving to profit by his words then he turned the conversation on quite another theme health was the subject he delicately alluded to my fragile appearance and spoke of the necessity of a strong constitution to sustain a vigorous mind if the mind prevailed over the weak body in its turn it became affected by decay and would eventually lose its powers it was applicable to all cases he did not mean that i was sickly but that my appearance bespoke one who had not been used to the exercise that was most necessary for me horseback rides walks fresh air were necessary to preserve health no man had greater disgust for a freckled face than he but a fair face could be preserved by the most ordinary precautions and even improved by such exercise he illustrated my case by showing the difference between the flower growing in the sunshine and that growing in a cellar fathers own illustration and very words when he so often tried to impress on me the necessity of gaining a more robust frame than nature had bestowed and a letter he had made hal write me showing the danger of such neglect rose before me i forgot colonel breaux i remembered only the ardent desire of those two who seemed to speak to me through his lips it produced its effect i felt the guilt i had incurred by not making greater efforts to gain a more robust frame and putting on my sunbonnet as i arose from the breakfasttable this morning i took my seat here on the wide balcony where i have remained seated on the floor ever since with a chair for a desk trying to drink an extra amount of fresh air i was sorry when colonel breaux arose to take his leave as he took my hand i said earnestly thank you for giving me something to think about he looked gratified made some pleasant remark and after talking a while longer said goodnight again and rode off while undressing miriam and i spoke of nothing else and when i lay down and looked in my own heart and saw my shocking ignorance and pitiful inferiority so painfully evident even to my own eyes i actually cried why was i denied the education that would enable me to be the equal of such a man as colonel breaux and the others he says the womans mind is the same as the mans originally it is only education that creates the difference why was i denied that education who is to blame have i exerted fully the natural desire to know that is implanted in all hearts have i done myself injustice in my selftaught ignorance or has injustice been done to me where is the fault i cried have i labored to improve the few opportunities thrown in my path to the best of my ability answer for yourself with the exception of ten short months at school where you learned nothing except arithmetic you have been your own teacher your own scholar all your life after you were taught by mother the elements of reading and writing give an account of your charge what do you know nothing except that i am a fool and i buried my face in the sheet i did not like even the darkness to see me in my humiliation while anna and miriam went out riding last evening just as i put down my pen i went out for a solitary walk down the road that gibbes would have to pass but saw nothing of the carriage when i got back they told me he was wounded my fears were well founded then with what anxiety we waited for his coming it would be impossible to describe every wagon rattling through the fields made us stop and listen every canestalk waving in the moonlight brought us to our feet at last after supper far off in the clear light we saw the carriage i could not sit still i walked down the steps and stood under the tree in front followed by anna i did not like her to stand nearer the spot where it would stop than i even all the rest remained on the balcony we did not know how serious the wound might be we must be careful eugene carter advised caution for more reasons than one look out he cried suppose it should be colonel breaux then i am afraid the colonel will get a kiss i answered nervously shuffling from one foot to the other but suppose it is mr m he persisted oh thank you for the caution i will look carefully before i greet him i returned moving to the other side for nearer around the circle moved the carriage i heard his voice o gibbes where is it left shoulder mere scratch he answered the carriage stopped gibbes gibbes i cried my darling and he had his great strong arm around me the left was hanging in a sling slowly the others moved down the steps towards him what a meeting my heart was in my throat i was so happy every one caught the well hand and kissed him again and again and every one shrunk from that left side i had almost forgotten my gear lygia in my excitement we followed him on the balcony and put him in a chair near the steps i pulled off his hat and coat and knelt in front of him with my arm across his lap to get near enough miriam stood on the steps with his arm around her shoulder and lydia near the others stood around altogether it was a happy group that performed in the tableau of the soldiers return presently the negroes gathered too how is you mass gibbes in all imaginable keys and accents was heard while the captain shook hands with each and inquired into their own state of health but even wounded soldiers can eat so supper was again prepared i am afraid it gave me too much pleasure to cut up his food it was very agreeable to butter his cornbread carve his mutton and spread his preserves but i doubt whether it could be so pleasant to a strong man accustomed to do such small services for himself we listened to him talk but though it was evident from his slow deliberate speech so different from his ordinary habit that he was suffering yet i felt impatient when he was interrupted by any commonplace observation by one of us i wanted to learn something of his exploits much knowledge i obtained he was wounded at sharpsburg on the 17th september at nine in the morning that is all the information i got concerning himself one would imagine that the seventeen months that have elapsed since we last met had been passed in a prolonged picnic concerning others he was quite communicative father hubert told him he had seen george in the battle and he had come out safe gibbes did not even know that he was in it until then our army having accomplished its object recrossed the potomac after what was decidedly a drawn battle both sides suffered severely hardly an officer on either side escaped unhurt mr mcgimsey is wounded and major herron reported killed i expect the list will contain the names of many friends when it comes i have just come from seeing gibbess wound dressed if that is a scratch heaven defend me from wounds a mini ball struck his left shoulder strap which caused it to glance thereby saving the bone just above in the fleshy part it tore the flesh off in a strip three inches and a half by two such a great raw green pulpy wound bound around by a heavy red ridge of flesh mrs badger who dressed it turned sick miriam turned away groaning servants exclaimed with horror it was the first experience of any except mrs badger in wounds i wanted to try my nerves so i held the towel around his body and kept the flies off while it was being washed he talked all the time ridiculing the groans of sympathy over a scratch and oh how i loved him for his fortitude it is so offensive that the water trickling on my dress has obliged me to change it last night i actually drew from gibbes the outlines of jacksons campaign he told me of some heroic deeds of his fellow soldiers but of his own not a word i have seen his name too often in the papers to believe that he has no deeds of his own to relate if he only would it is astonishing what a quantity of fresh air has been consumed by me since i formed that wise resolution the supply must be largely increased to keep up with the demand perhaps that is the cause of all these clouds and showers i must be making a severe drain on the economy of heaven from breakfast to dinner i remain on the balcony and read aloud several chapters of the mmoires of dumas by way of practice a dictionary lies by me and i suffer no word to pass without a perfect definition then comes my french grammar which i study while knitting or sewing which takes very nearly until dinnertime after that i do as i please either reading or talking until sunset when we can ride or walk the walk being always sweetened with sugarcane the evening we always spend on the balcony is that grand air enough o mon teint je serai joliment brune we three girls occupy the same room since gibbess arrival and have ever so much fun and not half enough sleep i believe the other two complain of me as the cause but i plead not guilty i never was known to laugh aloud no matter how intense might have been my mirth it wont come as gibbes murmured last night while reading aloud artemus wards last letter when we discovered it was suppressed laughter rather than suppressed pain that caused him to writhe so on the other hand anna and miriam laugh as loud and lustily as daughters of the titans if the respectable gentlemen had daughters i confess to doing more than half the talking but as to the laugh that follows not a bit last night i thought they would go wild and i too laughed myself into silent convulsions when i recited an early effusion of my poetic muse for their edification miriam made the bedstead prance fairly while annas laugh sounded like a bull of bashan with his head in a bolster case miriam went off to clinton before daylight yesterday with mr carter and mrs worley she would not let me go for fear mother should keep us at midnight they got back last night tired sleepy and halffrozen for our first touch of cool weather came in a strong north wind in the evening which grew stronger and stronger through the night and they had worn only muslin dresses i shall never cease to regret that i did not go too miriam says mother is looking very sad sad and i am trying to forget all our troubles and am so happy here o mother how selfish it was to leave you i ask myself whether it were best to stay there where we would only be miserable without adding anything to your comfort or pleasure or to be here careless and happy while you are in that horrid hole so sad and lonesome according to my theory miriam would remind me that i say it is better to have three miserable persons than two happy ones whose happiness occasions the misery of the third that is my doctrine only in peculiar cases it cannot be applied to this one i say that if for example miriam and i should love the same person while that person loved only me rather than make her unhappy by seeing me marry him i would prefer making both him and myself miserable by remaining single she says fudge which means i suppose nonsense but our happiness here does not occasion mothers unhappiness she would rather see us enjoying ourselves here than moping there one proof is that she did not suggest our return she longs to get home but cannot leave poor lilly alone for charlie is in granada oh how willingly i would return to the old wreck of our home all its desolation could not be half so unendurable as clinton but lilly cannot be left poor lilly when i look at her sad young face my heart bleeds for her with five helpless little children to care for is she not to be pitied i think that such a charge in such dreadful days would kill me how patiently she bears it it seems an age since i have opened this book how the time has passed since i have but a vague idea beyond that it has passed very pleasantly once since i have been with mrs badger to a mr powell who has started quite an extensive shoemaking establishment in the vain attempt to get something to cover my naked feet i am so much in need that i have been obliged to borrow lydias shoes every time i have been out since she returned this was my second visit there and i have no greater satisfaction than i had at first he got my measure i got his promise and that is the end of it thus far his son a young man of about twentyfour had the cap of his knee shot off at baton rouge ever since he has been iying on his couch unable to stand and the probability is that he will never stand again instead of going out to the manufactory mrs badger has each time stopped at the house to see his mother who by the way kissed me and called me sissie to my great amusement and there i have seen this poor young man he seems so patient and resigned that it is really edifying to be with him he is very communicative too and seems to enjoy company no matter if he does say hern and hisn wonder why he doesnt say shisen too the girls are highly amused at the description i give of my new acquaintance but still more so at mrs badgers account of the friendship of this poor young cripple and his enjoyment of my visits of course it is only her own version as she is very fond of jokes of all kinds night before last lydia got playing the piano for me in the darkened parlor and the old tunes from her dear little fingers sent me off in a sea of dreams she too caught the vision and launched off in a wellremembered quadrille the same scene flashed on us and at each note almost we would recall a little circumstance charming to us but unintelligible to anna who occupied the other side together we talked over the dramatis person mrs morgan jr in dark blue silk with black flounces a crimson chenille net on her black hair sits at the piano in her own parlor on the brussels carpet stands among others her majesty queen miriam in a lilac silk with bare neck and arms save for the protection afforded by a bertha of appliqu lace trimmed with pink ribbon with hair la madonna and fastened low on her neck is she not handsome as she stands fronting the folding doors her hand in tall mr trezevants just as she commences to dance with the tip of her black bottine just showing visvis stands pretty sophie with her large graceful mouth smiling and showing her pretty teeth to the best advantage a low neck and short sleeved green and white poplin is her dress while her black hair combed off from her forehead carelessly is caught by a comb at the back and falls in curls on her shoulders a prettier picture could not be wished for as she looks around with sparkling eyes eager for the dance to begin there stands calm dena in snuffcolored silk looking so immeasurably the superior of her partner who i fancy rather feels that she is the better man of the two from his nervous way of shifting from one foot to the other without saying a word to her nettie in lilac and white stands by the mantel laughing undisguisedly at her partner rather than with him yet so goodhumoredly that he cannot take offense but rather laughs with her lackadaisical gertrude whose face is so perfect in the daytime looks pale and insipid by gaslight and timidly walks through the dance stout goodnatured minna smiles and laughs never quite completing a sentence partly from embarrassment partly because she hardly knows how but still so sweet and amiable that one cannot find fault with her for so trifling a misfortune at this point lydia suggests and sarah do you forget her i laugh how could i forget there she stands in a light blue silk checked in tiny squares with little flounces up to her knee her dress fits well and she wears very pretty sleeves and collar of appliqu lydia asks if that is all and how she looks the same old song i answer she is looking at miriam just now you would hardly notice her but certainly her hair is well combed that is all you can say for her who is she dancing with a youth fond of dreams futile ones at that i laughingly reply he must be relating one just now for there is a very perceptible curl on her upper lip and she is looking at him as though she thought she was the tallest lydia dashes off into a lively jig ladies to the right i cried she laughed too well knowing that that part of the dance was invariably repeated a dozen times at least she looked slyly up i am thinking of how many hands i saw squeezed she said i am afraid it did happen once or twice eighteen months ago what a change one who was prominent on such occasions mr sparks they tell me is dead may god have mercy on his soul in the name of jesus christ i did not ask even this revenge last night mother arrived from clinton with gibbes and lydia who had gone there the day before to get her to go to baton rouge what an unexpected change i am surprised myself yesterday as the baton rouge party were about leaving miriam thought lilly would be lonesome alone here with her sick baby and decided that we should leave by the cars and stay with her until mother returned there was no time to lose so dressing in haste we persuaded anna to accompany us and in a few moments stood ready we walked down to the overseers house to wait for the cars and passed the time most agreeably in eating sugarcane having brought a little negro expressly to cut it for us and carry our carpetbag three young ladies who expected to be gone from saturday until wednesday having but one carpetbag between them can it be credited but then we knew we had clothes here and depended upon them for supplies when we now find they are in the trunk and mother has the key we walked aboard alone in the crowded train and found ourselves in the only car reserved for ladies which was already filled with a large party returning from port hudson consisting of the fastest set of girls that i have seen for some time anna and i had to content ourselves with a seat on a small box between the benches while miriam was established on the only vacant one with a sick soldier lying at her feet the fast girls talked as loud as possible and laughed in a corresponding style in spite of the sick man they must have been on a picnic from the way they talked one in a short dress complained that she had not seen her sweetheart a pert little miss of thirteen cried you can bet your head i never went to any place where i did not see one of my sweethearts one of about seventeen a perfect beauty declared she would die of thirst so will i and i dont want to die before i get a husband exclaimed her visvis they evidently expected to produce an impression on us at every brilliant remark stupid understood they looked at us to see what we thought all of them sat with bare heads in the strong light an unfailing proof of la basse classe on steamers and cars every time my veil blew aside they made no difficulty about scanning my features as though they thought it might be agreeable i must confess i was equally impolite in regard to the beauty but then her loveliness was an excuse and my veil sheltered me besides while this young psyche was fascinating me with her perfect face and innocent expression one of her companions made a remark one that i dare say is made every day and that i never imagined could be turned into harm my beauty uttered a prolonged oh of horror and burst out laughing followed by all the others my disgust was unspeakable mock modesty is always evident a modest girl could not have noticed the catch the immodest on the lookout for such an opportunity was the only one who could have perceived it well after all no one can be perfect this may be the single stain on my beauty though i confess i would rather have any other failing than this almost putting this aside i hardly know which i was most amused by the giddy lively girls to my right or the two ladies to my left who were as cross and illnatured as two old cats and railed unmercifully at the silly creatures behind them and carried their spite so far as to refuse to drink because the conductor the husband of one of them gave the young ladies water before passing it to their two elders did nt the poor man get it she would nt taste a drop of that nasty dirty drippings that she would nt might have had the decency to attend to his kinsfolks before them creatures and why did nt he wait on those two young ladies behind her he did ask them well ask them again they must want some poor henpecked meekly passed the can again to be again civilly declined i confess the drippings were too much for me also though i did not give it as my excuse mrs hen recommenced her pecking poor mr hen at last surlily rejoined for heavens sake dont make a fuss in the cars with an emphasis on the last word that showed he was accustomed to it at home at least with my veil down i leaned against the window and remembering colonel breauxs remarks two nights before concerning cross people i played his little philosopher for the remainder of the journey at sunset we walked in at lillys gate and astonished her by standing before her as she sat alone with her poor sick little beatrice in her arms we left clinton this morning and have just now arrived by the cars charlie came in last evening to our great surprise so we did not scruple to leave lilly the baton rouge party returned late this evening in spite of all preparation gibbes was horrified at the appearance of home a letter from jimmy the first we have received since new orleans fell it was dated the 10th inst and he spoke of being on the eve of running the blockade and going to liverpool to represent our unfortunate navy as he says though i am at loss to imagine what he can mean he speaks of a kind friend a mr george trenholm whose kindness has been perfectly extraordinary he has befriended him in every way charlie has just come by the railroad bringing other letters from him to mother and lilly in mothers is his last goodbye on the 12th again mr trenholm is the theme i could not help crying over my dear little brothers manly affectionate letter he says he is sure god will still care for him he has raised him up friends wherever he has been he says he lost all his clothing in going to charleston there among other kind people he met this gentleman who carried him to his house where he has kept him ever since treating him like his son and forced him to accept a magnificent outfit as a present from him he procured the appointment which sends jimmy abroad i wish jimmy had been more explicit concerning it we hardly know what it is or how long it will keep him the money he received to pay jimmys passage received from the government he in turn obliged jimmy to accept as he sails in one of mr trenholms steamers and not satisfied with that gives him carte blanche on his house in england to be filled up with any amount he chooses to name mother went back to clinton with charlie that evening to my great distress for she hates that odious place as much as i i know the life will kill her if it lasts six months longer how happy i would be if it were not for the thought of her uncomfortable position there lilly agrees with me that once out of it she never wishes to see the vile place again margret says that when the lord had finished all the world and all the people he had some scraps left and just thought hed batch up clinton with them perhaps she is right this place is completely overrun by soldiers passing and repassing friday night five stayed here last night two more and another has just gone one last night a bashful tennesseean had never tasted sugarcane we were sitting around a blazing fire enjoying it hugely when in answer to our repeated invitations to help himself he confessed he had never eaten it once instructed though he got on remarkably well and ate it in a civilized manner considering it was a first attempt everything points to a speedy attack on port hudson rumors reach us from new orleans of extensive preparations by land and water and of the determination to burn clinton as soon as they reach it in revenge for the looms that were carried from baton rouge there and which can soon be put in working order to supply our soldiers negroes and ourselves with necessary clothing of two evils if baton rouge is to be overrun by yankees and clinton burned i would rather await them at home yesterday was a day of novel sensations to me first came a letter from mother announcing her determination to return home and telling us to be ready next week poor mother she wrote drearily enough of the hardships we would be obliged to undergo in the dismantled house and of the new experience that lay before us but n importe i am ready to follow her to yankeeland or any other place she chooses to go it is selfish for me to be so happy here while she leads such a distasteful life in clinton in her postscript though she said she would wait a few days longer to see about the grand battle which is supposed to be impending so our stay will be indefinitely prolonged how thankful i am that we will really get back though i hardly believe it possible however it is too good to be believed the nightmare of a probable stay in clinton being removed i got in what the boys call a perfect gale and sang all my old songs with a greater relish than i have experienced for many a long month my heart was open to every one so forgiving and amiable did i feel that i went downstairs to see will carter i made him so angry last tuesday that he went home in a fit of sullen rage it seems that some time ago some one he said told him such a joke on me that he had laughed all night at it mortified beyond all expression at the thought of having had my name mentioned between two men i who have thus far fancied myself secure from all remarks good bad or indifferent of men i refused to have anything to say to him until he should either explain me the joke or in case it was not fit to be repeated to me until he apologized for the insult he took two minutes to make up a lie this was the joke he said our milkman had said that that sarah morgan was the proudest girl he ever saw that she walked the streets as though the earth was not good enough for her my milkman making his remarks i confess i was perfectly aghast with surprise and did not conceal my contempt for the remark or his authority either but one cant fight ones milkman i did not care for what he or any of that class could say i was surprised to find that they thought at all but i resented it as an insult as coming from mr carter until with tears in his eyes fairly and in all humility he swore that if it had been anything that could reflect on me in the slightest degree he would thrash the next man who mentioned my name i was not uneasy about a milkmans remarks so i let it pass after making him acknowledge that he had told me a falsehood concerning the remark which had been made but i kept my revenge i had but to cry milk in his hearing to make him turn crimson with rage at last he told me that the less i said on the subject the better it would be for me i could not agree milk i insisted was a delightful beverage i had always been under the impression that we owned a cow until he had informed me it was a milkman but was perfectly indifferent to the animal so i got the milk with some such allusion i could make him mad in an instant either a guilty conscience or the real joke grated harshly on him and i possessed the power of making it still worse tuesday i pressed it too far he was furious and all the family warned me that i was making a dangerous enemy yesterday he came back in a good humor and found me in unimpaired spirits i had not talked even of curds though i had given him several hard cuts on other subjects when an accident happened which frightened all malicious fun out of me we were about going out after cane and miriam had already pulled on one of her buckskin gloves dubbed old sweety from the quantity of canejuice they contain when mr carter slipped on its mate and held it tauntingly out to her she tapped it with a caseknife she held when a stream of blood shot up through the glove a vein was cut and was bleeding profusely he laughed but panic seized the women some brought a basin some stood around i ran after cobwebs while helen carter held the vein and miriam stood in silent horror too frightened to move it was indeed alarming for no one seemed to know what to do and the blood flowed rapidly presently he turned a dreadful color and stopped laughing i brought a chair while the others thrust him into it his face grew more deathlike his mouth trembled his eyes rolled his head dropped i comprehended that these must be symptoms of fainting a phenomenon i had never beheld i rushed after water and lydia after cologne between us it passed away but for those few moments i thought it was all over with him and trembled for miriam presently he laughed again and said helen if i die take all my negroes and money and prosecute those two girls dont let them escape then seeing my long face he commenced teasing me dont ever pretend you dont care for me again here you have been unmerciful to me for months hurting more than this cut never sparing me once and the moment i get scratched it s o mr carter and you fly around like wild and wait on me in vain i represented that i would have done the same for his old lame dog and that i did not like him a bit better he would not believe it but persisted that i was a humbug and that i liked him in spite of my protestations as long as he was in danger of bleeding to death i let him have his way and frightened out of teasing spared him for the rest of the evening just at what would have been twilight but for the moonshine when he went home after the blood was stanched and the hand tightly bound a carriage drove up to the house and colonel allen was announced i cant say i was ever more disappointed i had fancied him tall handsome and elegant i had heard of him as a perfect fascinator a womankiller lo a wee little man is carried in in the arms of two others wounded in both legs at baton rouge he has never yet been able to stand he was accompanied by a mr bradford whose assiduous attentions and boundless admiration for the colonel struck me as unusual i had not observed him otherwise until the general whispered do you know that that is the brother of your old sweetheart though the appellation was by no means merited i recognized the one he meant brother to our mr bradford of eighteen months ago my astonishment was unbounded and alluded to it immediately he said it was so that his brother had often spoken to him of us and the pleasant evenings he had spent at home o what a glorious time we had yesterday first there were those two gentlemen to be entertained all day which was rather a stretch i confess so i stole away for a while then i got the sweetest letter from miss trenholm enclosing jimmys photograph and she praised him so that i was in a damp state of happiness and flew around showing my picture to everybody mr bradford included who pronounced him a noble boy and admired him to my satisfaction then came a letter from lilly saying mother had decided to remain in clinton and wanted us to join her there o my prophetic soul my heart went below zero then colonel allen sent to port hudson for the band to serenade us and raised my spirits in anticipation of the treat while performing my toilet in the evening waller fowler arrived on his way to vicksburg bringing a letter to miriam from major drum heaven only knows how it got here such a dear kind letter dated 6th of august only affairs were very different then and he said that lavinias distress about us was such that he must try to send her nearer to us and such an unexpected piece of news oh my heart fails me i cannot fancy lavinia a mother slowly i dressed myself and still more slowly i combed anna i could think of nothing else until i heard miriam and mr bradford call us to take a walk when we hurried down to them a race down to the railroad a merry talk standing on the track mingled with shouts of laughter in which i tried to drown fears for lavinia made the early sunset clouds pass away sooner than usual to us and moonlight warned us to return mrs worley passed us in her buggy coming to stay all night and halfway a servant met us saying two soldiers had come to call on us once there i was surprised to find that one was frank enders the one i least expected to see the other was a mr harold i need not describe him beyond this slight indication of his style before half an hour was over he remarked to anna that i was a very handsome girl and addressed me as miss sally that is sufficient then will carter came in and joined our circle his first aside was if you only knew how much i liked you last night you would never be cruel to me again why i thought you the greatest girl in the world please lets part friends tonight again i would not promise for i knew i would tease him yet and at supper when i insisted on his taking a glass of milk his face turned so red that mrs carter pinched my arm blue and refused to help me to preserves because i was making will mad but waller helped me and i drank my own milk to mr carters health with my sweetest smile confound that milkman i wish he had cut his throat before i stumbled over him he exclaimed after tea but i had more amusing game than to make him angry then i wanted to laugh to get rid of the phantom that pursued me lavinia the evening passed off very pleasantly i think there were some eighteen of us in the parlor about ten the general went to the sugarhouse he commenced grinding yesterday and whispered to me to bring the young people down presently mr bradford and i succeeded in moving them and we three girls retired to change our pretty dresses for plain ones and get shawls and nuages for our warm week had suddenly passed away and it was quite cold out some of the gentlemen remarked that very few young ladies would have the courage to change pretty evening dresses for calico after appearing to such advantage many would prefer wearing such dresses however inappropriate to the sugarmill with his droll gravity gibbes answered oh our girls dont want to be stuck up there was quite a string of us as we straggled out in the beautiful moonlight with only mrs badger as an escort mr enders and i had a gay walk of it and when we all met at the furnace we stopped and warmed ourselves and had a laugh before going in inside it was lighted up with confederate gas in other words pine torches which shed a delightful light neither too much nor too little over the different rooms we tried each by turns the row of bubbling kettles with the dusky negroes bending over in the steam and lightly turning their paddles in the foamy syrup the whole under the influence of torchlight was very interesting but then mr enders and i found a place more pleasant still it was in the first purgery standing at the mouth of the shoot through which the liquid sugar runs into the car and taking the place of the car as soon as it was run off to the coolers each armed with a paddle scraped the colon up and had our own fun while eating then running along the little railroad to where the others stood in the second room over the vats and racing back again all together to eat sugarcane and cut up generally around our first pine torch we had really a gay time presently puss wants a corner was suggested and all flew up to the second staging under the canecarrier and by the engine such racing for corners such scuffles among the gentlemen such confusion among the girls when springing forward for a place we would find it already occupied all dignity was discarded we laughed and ran as loud and fast as any children and the general enjoyed our fun as much as we and encouraged us in our pranks waller surpassed himself mr bradford carried all by storm mr enders looked like a schoolboy on a frolic mr carter looked sullen and tried lazily not to mar the sport completely while mr harold looked timidly foolish and half afraid of our wild sport mrs badger laughed the general roared anna flew around like a balloon miriam fairly danced around with fun and frolic while i laughed so that it was an exertion to change corners then forfeits followed with the usual absurd formalities in which mr bradford sentenced himself unconsciously to ride a barrel miriam to make him a love speech going home mr enders to kiss my hand and i to make him mr enders a declaration which i instantly did in french whereby i suffered no inconvenience as miriam alone comprehended then came more sugarcane and talk in the purgery and we were horrified when mrs badger announced that it was twelve oclock and gave orders to retire o the pleasant walk home then of course followed a last goodnight on the balcony while the two young men mounted their horses and frank enders vowed to slip off every time he had a chance and come out to see us then there was a grand proposition for a ride to port hudson on horseback and in order to secure a pledge that we would pass by general beales headquarters mr enders wrapped my nuage around his throat declaring that i would be obliged to stop there for it though if prevented he would certainly be obliged to bring it back himself this morning however the married ladies made so much difficulty about who should go and how that we were forced to abandon it much as we would have enjoyed it i am afraid to say how late it was when we got to bed i know it was almost ten when we left the breakfasttable this morning so i suppose it must have been quite late before we retired to colonel allens as well as to our own great disappointment the band could not come on account of sickness we three girls fancied a walk last evening and immediately after dinner prepared to walk to mrs breauxs only a mile and get her to come to the sugarhouse but as we put on our bonnets captain bradford brother of the one who left in the morning was announced and our expedition had to be abandoned this is the third of the five brothers that i have met and if it were not for the peculiarity in their voices should say that there was not the most distant relationship existing between them this one is very handsome quiet and what dickens calls in a highshouldered state of deportment he looks like a mosscovered stone wall a slumbering volcano a what you please so it suggests anything unexpected and dangerous to stumble over a man of indomitable will and intense feeling i am sure i should not like to rouse his temper or give him cause to hate me a trip to the sugarhouse followed as a matter of course and we showed him around and told him of the fun we had those two nights and taught him how to use a paddle like a christian we remained there until suppertime when we adjourned to the house where we spent the remainder of the evening very pleasantly at least i suppose he found it so for it was ten oclock before he left just now i was startled by a pistol shot threatening to shoot her mr carter playfully aimed miriams pistol at her and before he could take fair aim one barrel went off the shot grazing her arm and passing through the armoir just behind of course there was great consternation those two seem doomed to kill each other she had played him the same trick before he swore that he would have killed himself with the other shot if she had been hurt but what good would that do her i hardly know how these last days have passed i have an indistinct recollection of rides in canewagons to the most distant field coming back perched on the top of the cane singing dye my petticoats to the great amusement of the general who followed on horseback anna and miriam comfortably reposing in corners were too busy to join in as their whole time and attention were entirely devoted to the consumption of cane it was only by singing rough impromptus on mr harold and captain bradford that i roused them from their task long enough to join in a chorus of forty thousand chinese i would not have changed my perch four mules and black driver for queen victorias coach and six and to think old abe wants to deprive us of all that fun no more cotton sugarcane or rice no more old black aunties or uncles no more rides in mule teams no more songs in the canefield no more steaming kettles no more black faces and shining teeth around the furnace fires if lincoln could spend the grinding season on a plantation he would recall his proclamation as it is he has only proved himself a fool without injuring us why last evening i took old wilsons place at the bagasse shoot and kept the rollers free from cane until i had thrown down enough to fill several carts and had my hands as black as his what cruelty to slaves and black frank thinks me cruel too when he meets me with a patronizing grin and shows me the nicest vats of candy and peels cane for me oh very cruel and so does jules when he wipes the handle of his paddle on his apron to give mamselle a chance to skim the kettles and learn how to work yes and so do all the rest who meet us with a courtesy and howdy young missus last night we girls sat on the wood just in front of the furnace rather miriam and anna did while i sat in their laps and with some twenty of all ages crowded around we sang away to their great amusement poor oppressed devils why did you not chunk us with the burning logs instead of looking happy and laughing like fools really some good old abolitionist is needed here to tell them how miserable they are cant mass abe spare a few to enlighten his brethren in spite of its being sunday no sooner was dinner concluded yesterday than we adjourned as usual to the sugarhouse to see how much damage we could do each took from a negro his long paddle and for more than half an hour skimmed the kettles industriously to the amazement of half a dozen strange soldiers who came to see the extraordinary process of sugarmaking at one time the two boys taking possession of the two other paddles not a negro was at the kettles but stood inspecting our work the hardest part we found to be discharging the batteries which none of us could do without their assistance we had no sooner relinquished our paddles than some one announced two gentlemen at the house while we were discussing the possibility of changing our dresses before being seen enter mr enders and gibbes morgan of fenners battery no retreat being possible we looked charmed and selfpossessed in spite of plain calicoes and sticky hands mr enders verv conveniently forgot to bring my nuage he says he started expressly to do so but reflecting that i might then have no inducement to pay that visit to port hudson he left it for another time we arranged a visit to gibbes and mr enders made me promise to call at general beales headquarters for a pass they will want you to go to the provost marshals for it but you just come to general beales and send a courier for me and i will bring it myself and half in fun half in earnest i promised once more a cripple and consigned to my bed for how long heaven only knows this is written while in a horizontal position reposing on my right arm which is almost numb from having supported me for some sixteen hours without turning over let me see if i can remember how it happened last evening we started out to see gibbes just miriam and anna in one buggy and mrs badger and i in the other gibbes proper that is the captain and the general both approved but neither could accompany us it is useless to say how much i objected to going without a gentleman indeed when we reached the road which formed the fourth side of the square formed by colonel breauxs captain bradfords and captain fenners camps i thought i should die of terror on finding myself in such a crowd of soldiers on parade my thick veil alone consoled me but i made a vow that i would not go through it again not if i never saw gibbes jr again on earth his camp lay far off from the road so that we had to drive out to it between the other two and asked a soldier to tell him that we were there presently he came up looking so pleased that i was almost glad that we had come and then captain fenner appeared looking charmed and lieutenant harris who looked more alarmed and timid than i captain fenner exerted himself to entertain us and seeing how frightened i was assured me that it was an everyday occurrence for young ladies to visit them in parties without gentlemen and that it was done all through the confederacy which however did not comfort me for the hundreds of eyes that were looking at us as our small party stood out in front of the encampment around a cannon i think he can throw more expression into his eyes than any one i ever saw miriam suggested sending gibbes to the provost to get our pass in order to avoid the crowd that might be there eager to leave the present one for a more retired spot i exclaimed oh no let us go ourselves we cant get in a worse crowd i meant a greater but captain fenner looked so comically at me that i could scarcely laugh out an apology while he laughed so that i am sure he did not listen to me what a comical mouth i liked him very much this time he promised to come out today or tomorrow and have a game of puss wants a corner in the sugarhouse but now i cant join in though it was to me the promise was made but to the catastrophe at once as we left we insisted on taking gibbes to get our pass and made him get into miriams buggy where there was space for him to kneel and drive i was to carry out my promise to mr enders we had to pass just by the camp of the first alabama colonel steadmans where the whole regiment was on parade we had not gone thirty yards beyond them when a gun was discharged the horse instantly ran off i dont believe there could be two cooler individuals than mrs badger and i were i had every confidence in her being able to hold him so long as the bridle lasted i had heard that there was more danger in jumping at such moments than in remaining quiet so i sat still there was nothing to hold to as it was a notop or what i call a lowneck buggy so my hands rested quietly in my lap presently i saw the left rein snap close to the horses mouth i knew all was over then but did not utter a word death seemed inevitable and i thought it was as well to take it coolly the horse turned abruptly i felt that something impelled me out followed the impulse saw mrs badgers white cape fluttering above me received a blow on the extremity of my spine that i thought would kill me before i reached the ground landing however on my left hip and quietly reclining on my left elbow with my face to an upset buggy whose wheels spun around in empty air i heard a rush as of horses i saw men galloping up i would have given worlds to spring to my feet or even to see if they were exposed but found i could not move i had no more power over my limbs than if they were iron only the intense pain told me i was still alive i was perfectly conscious but unable to move my only wonder was why miriam who was in front did not come to me my arm was giving away dimly as through a haze or dream i saw a soldier bending over me trying to raise me the horse he had sprung from rushed up to his master and reared up over me i saw the iron hoofs shining above my body death was certain this time but i could not move he raised his arm and struck him and obedient to the blow the animal turned aside and let his feet fall without crushing me mrs carter when she heard it described offered a fabulous sum for a correct drawing of that most interesting tableau the gallant alabamian supporting a helpless form on one arm while he reined in a fiery charger with the other i was not aware of the romance i was conscious only of the unpleasant situation dozens crowded around and if i had been a girl for display here was an opportunity for thirty pair of soldier arms were stretched out to hold me no gibbes gibbes i whispered and had the satisfaction of being transferred from a strangers to my cousins arms gibbes trembled more than i but with both arms clasped around me held me up but for that i would have returned to my original horizontal position send for the doctor cried one a surgeon quick cried another tell them no i motioned i was conscious of a clatter of hoofs and cloud of dust one performed a feat never heard of before he brought a glass of water at full gallop which i instantly drained by way of acknowledgment i think i felt the unpleasant situation more than the pain not being accustomed to being the centre of attraction i was by no means pleased with the novel experience miriam held my hand and questioned me with a voice tremulous with fear and laughter anna convulsively sobbed or giggled some question i felt the ridiculous position as much as they laughing was agony but i had to do it to give them an excuse which they readily seized to give vent to their feelings and encouraged by seeing it several goldband officers joined in constantly endeavoring to apologize or check themselves with a really miss it may seem unfeeling but it is impossible the rest was lost in a gasp and a wrestle between politeness and the desire to laugh i dont know what i was thinking of but i certainly paid very little attention to what was going on i only wanted to get home away from all those eyes and my most earnest wish made me forget them the first remark i heard was my young alabamian crying it is the most beautiful somerset i ever saw indeed it could not be more gracefully done your feet did not show naf but it was just what i wanted to know and dared not ask some one ran up and asked who was hurt and i heard another reply i am afraid the young lady is seriously injured only she wont acknowledge it it is worth while looking at her she is the coolest most dignified girl you ever saw and another was added to the already too numerous audience poor mrs badger having suffered only from torn clothing received very little sympathy while i got more than my share i really believe that the blow i received was from her two hundred and forty pound body though the alabamian declares he saw the overturning buggy strike me as i fell to her and others i am indebted for the repetition of many a remark that escaped me one bold soldier boy exclaimed madame we are all warriors but we cant equal that it is braver than any man i had to laugh occasionally to keep my spirits up but miriam ordered me to quit saying that i would go off in hysterics i had previously repeatedly declared to the doctor that i was not hurt and seeing him idle and hearing miriams remark the alabamian i am told cried o doctor doctor cant you do something is she going to have hysterics really said the doctor the young lady objects to being examined but as far as i can judge she has no limbs broken everybody ordered me to confess at once my injury but how was i to inform a whole crowd that i had probably broken the tip of my backbone and could not possibly sit down so i adhered to my first affirmation and made no objection when they piled the cushions up and made gibbes put me down for i knew he must be tired i am told i remained there an hour i know they talked to me and that i answered but have not an idea of the subject a gentleman brought a buggy and offered to drive me home but a captain lenair insisted on running after the ambulance arrived there mr enders says he rushed in crying for gods sake general beale lend me the ambulance there is a dreadful accident and i am afraid the young lady will die coming back he exclaimed by jove boys if you want to see a sight run down and see her hair the prettiest auburn you ever looked at and sweeps the ground would nt mind such a fall if i had such hair to show come look at it do mr enders says he was sure that it was i as soon as hair was mentioned and started out as soon as he had finished a duty he had to perform my garter a purple silk ribbon lay in the centre of the ring by the respectful silence observed i saw they recognized its use so unwilling to leave such a relic behind i asked aloud for my ribbon whereupon anna says the officers pinched each other and smiled up came the ambulance and i was in imminent danger of being carried to it when with a desperate effort i regained my feet with gibbess help and reached it without other assistance beyond i could do no more captain lenair got inside and several others lifted me up to him and i sank motionless on the floor all bade me goodbye and my little alabamian assured me that he was proud of having been the first to assist me president miller whispered to mrs badger for permission to accompany us which she readily granted and raising me on the seat he insisted on putting his arm around me to hold me up it was useless to decline now miss morgan i assure you i am an old married man i know you are suffering let me have my way and the kind old gentleman held me so comfortably and broke the force of so many jolts that i was forced to submit and acknowledge that had it not been for him i could not have endured the rough road at the gate that leads to general beales headquarters i saw half a dozen figures standing one was frank enders who hailed the driver hush said one i recognized as captain lenair the young lady is in there and the provost too i dont care if it is jeff davis i ll find out if she is hurt he answered miriam and anna recognized him as they followed behind us and called to him without more ado he jumped into their buggy finding them alone and drove them home he asked me something as he passed but i could not answer the road was dreadful once the driver mistook it and drove us within two steps of an embankment six feet high but discovered the mistake before the horses went over what i most dreaded was explanations when we should arrive miriam stepped out an instant before and i heard her telling the accident then everybody big and little white and black gathered around the ambulance the provost thought himself privileged to carry me gibbes insisted on trying it with his one arm when the general picked me up and landed me on the gallery he wanted me to lie down in old mrs carters room but confident that once there i could not get up and feeling that perhaps the gentlemen would take advantage of its being on the ground floor to suggest calling on me i struggled upstairs with helens assistance a dozen hands undressed me and laid me on my face in bed which position i have occupied up to the present 3 pm unable to turn all night i lay awake iying on my face the least comfortable of positions but though the slightest motion tortured me i had to laugh as we talked it over of course this has been written in scratches and in my same position which will account for many blots this morning i was interrupted by mothers unexpected arrival she having come with dellie and morgan to spend the day of course she is horrified at the accident of that unfortunate sarah i think i grow no better rapidly fortunately on wednesday night they succeeded in turning me over for my poor elbows having lost all their skin were completely used up now if i go slowly and carefully i can turn myself at the cost of some little suffering yesterday colonel steadman of the first alabama called with his father he sent me many messages of condolence and the rather unpleasant advice to be cupped and scarified his profession was that of a physician before he became colonel his surgeon whose name is madding told him he was satisfied that i was seriously injured though i had not complained the colonel is the same who called when we were in clinton they readily accepted our invitation to dinner and remained until late in the afternoon when captain bradford came in more messages of condolence and sympathy upstairs which produced no visible effect on my spine though very comforting to the spirit i was interrupted yesterday morning by mrs badger who wished to apply a few dry cups to my back to which i quietly submitted and was unable to move afterwards without pain as a reward for my patience but towards sunset came two dear letters that made me forget what i had suffered one from george and one from jimmy dated bermudas for the first time i know what my dear little brother suffered during those long months when we could not hear if he were dead or alive he kept the secret until he no longer needed either friends or money and now he tells it with a simplicity that made me cry fit to break my heart when i was left alone in the twilight with no one to see george comforts me with hopes of peace and a speedy return if it could only be this morning the boom of yankee guns reached my ears a sound i had hoped never to hear again it is only those poor devils i can afford to pity them in their fallen state banging away at some treasonable sugarhouses that are disobedient enough to grind cane on the other side of the river i hear that one is at mrs cains the sound made my heart throb what if the fight should come off before i can walk it takes three people to raise me whenever it is necessary for me to move i am worse than helpless a note just came from mother telling me that the most awful yankees were coming to burn linwood and take port hudson and so this evening i must walk down to the cars with a chair to rest in until they came and must certainly be in clinton tonight delightful arrangement i wrote to ask if she knew that my legs were of no more service to me than to her dr dortch has again been murdering me says perhaps i can stand by sunday if the yankees come before lying on my face as it were with my poor elbows for a support i try to pass away these lonely hours for with the exception of old mrs carter who is downstairs and the general who is elsewhere anna and i are the only white people on the place the cause of this heartless desertion is a grand display of tableaux vivants at jackson for the benefit of the soldiers hospital and of course it would be sinful to stay away particularly as anna is a great deal better and i need no care it would be only the absurd tableaux i agreed to with plenty of fun and nothing more so i tried to be merry and content and so i should have been for there was plenty to talk about and every one was so solicitous for my comfort and there was mr enders who would wheel my chair for me wherever i wished it and was as kind and attentive as a brother surely my first trip should have been a gay one miriam sat down by the piano mr enders drew me by her and we three sang until dark together a mr morse his wife and mother who are spending a week here were our audience the first two retired at candlelight while the latter present at the play the night before remained to the last but while we sang every noise at the parlor door caused us to turn with the apprehension of we hardly knew what a dozen times mr enders consulted his watch and telegraphed his fears to me though i persisted in thinking it only the fun that had been intended halfpast six came and with it mrs worley now she knew better for dr dortch had come to see me and was guiding me in my game of euchre in which i was not even as wise as my partner mr enders when her note came instantly we put down our cards while miriam begged him to write and tell her the true story he wrote and we all read it not only that but miriam added a postscript which i think was this word for word mrs worley it is only a bet at cards intended as the merest joke there is not a word of truth in it and i will consider it the greatest favor if you will contradict the report whenever you may hear it explicit enough one would think but still she came and sent word into the parlor that one of the ladies present when will made the announcement had sent her contribution to the evenings fun it turned out to be a complete bridal suit worn by the lady a year ago that was too serious a jest miriam went into the other room to speak to mrs worley who cold as an icicle refused to receive or make explanation beyond i wont kiss you this is too cruel there was nothing to do she returned laughing but certainly feeling herself the injured one and so she was in fifteen minutes another stir i held my breath with expectation lydia introduced mr g ten miles he had ridden through mud and water that freezing evening at will carters request to perform the ceremony between him and miriam lydia laughed until she could hardly introduce him he hat in hand bowed around the convulsed circle with a countenance shining with the most sublimely vacant expression o that mans idiotic face and solemn portentous look brought a writhe even to my trembling lips mr enders would have given one an excellent idea of the effect produced by a real old pineywoods chill he shook as with suppressed laughter but when the tremendous preacher tremendous because composed of gigantic nothing turned his lugubrious face towards mrs morse and addressed her as mrs morgan under the impression that she had come down to see her daughter married miriams risibles could no longer stand it and she flew from the room in time to avoid a disgraceful explosion i was growing frightened mr enders was leaning over my chair and involuntarily it burst from me with a groan for gods sake help me save her hush lie back in your chair i will he whispered but for the love of heaven save my sister ill do what you will if you will only keep still and not hurt yourself ill do my best it was all whispered that the minister and mrs morse might not hear if it were your sister what would you do my god id meet him on the front gallery and kick him out then id know one of us must die tomorrow but under the circumstances it is impossible for gibbes to act i urged while we agreed that it was the most unwarrantable piece of insolence ever perpetrated while we talked gibbes had seized miriam and without interfering or advising further advised her to keep her room and not meet will but i skipped the most important part she came back when she had recovered her composure and sat by me mr enders when i asked what was best to do whispered that to spare wills feelings and avoid a most painful scene as well as to show that she had no serious intentions whatever she should see that the minister was put in full possession of the facts before it went any farther he felt keenly his unpleasant situation and it was only our earnest request that induced him to remain or give his advice who should explain certainly not the general he thought the joke carried too far and retired to his room before mr g came how take part against his own nephew not gibbes either for he had gone upstairs too worried and annoyed to talk to any one besides it was his wifes cousin who then miriam is one woman in a thousand rising she crossed the room slowly and as dignified as though she only meant to warm herself i think i see her before me now as she stood before the fire facing mr g looking so handsome and stylish in her black grenadine with the palegreen trimming telling her story plainly earnestly distinctly without hurry or embarrassment in the neatest prettiest most admirable speech i ever heard she told everything just as it was bravo for miriam there lives not the woman in this state who could do so painful a thing in such a beautiful way i felt like hugging her oh it was magnificent he heard her in surprise but when once satisfied of its truth he said well miss morgan when you stand on the floor when i ask if you will it is your privilege to answer no miriam is not one to do so cruel a thing she is too noble to deceive him so far and wound him so cruelly before all when he believed himself so near happiness she said that it was mockery she would not suffer him to believe for an instant that she meant to marry him if he believed it he was deceiving himself wilfully for he already knew that she had told him it could never be he agreed to take it only as a jest promised that he would not feel hurt and with the most admirable tact miriam the trump i have been playing euchre excuse me settled the minister and the wedding by her splendid behavior with no trouble a rapid step was heard in the hall the bridegroom had come i know he must have killed his horse he certainly did not leave his house before one oclock it is twenty miles by the road to clinton he went there procured his license and was here at seven in full costume he bounded upstairs to meet the brideelect i can fancy him going to clinton doubting fearing believing against all evidence yet trembling securing the license at last persuading himself that she would not dare refuse when the deeds were recorded in court and he held them in his hand and very few women would have been brave enough too he did not know my miriam i can fancy the poor horse lashed through the heavy mire tired foaming panting while his strong arm urged it on with whip and spur i can hear the exulting beating of his heart that wild refrain that was raging as his deathknell mine mine at last i could hear it i say it rung in my ears all night he held her in his power she must be his hastily yet carefully he performs his toilet i dare say he stopped to think which cravat she liked best mine mine the song is ringing in every stroke of his throbbing breast mount mount two miles fly past he sweeps through the moonlight like death riding on a pale horse yonder shine lights in the parlor and that above is it hers he throws himself from his horse his hour has come hers too with the license and minister his own adoration and she must love him too he will win show him the way to her she is his forever now his my god had i not reason to cry in gods name save her frank he reaches mrs carters room and triumphantly throws the license on her table he is ready now where is his bride some one meets him will the story is told she is not to be won by force she has appealed to the minister he has carried the jest too far the strong man reels he falls on the bed in his bridal array in agony too great for tears i dare not ask what followed they tell me it was awful what madness and folly to dream of forcing her to marry him why if she had loved him the highhanded proceeding would have roused the lion of her spirit he is no mate for her he has but one thought and at last words come miriam miriam call her for the love of god one word one look oh she will take pity on him in his misery let her come for one instant she cannot be so cruel she will marry him if only to save him from death or worse and fortunate it was that he was not armed one of the two would have died perhaps both the heartbroken prayer goes on the exulting mine mine has changed to the groan of despair miriam for the love of god come to me and where is the bride gibbes has her caged in the next room this one where i am now lying he has advised her not to appear to go to bed and say no more sent to bed like a baby on her wedding night she says that she laughed aloud when the door closed on her she laughing in here he groaning in there it is to be hoped they each drowned the voice of the other the minister said goodnight he disclaimed all feeling of pique he felt chiefly for the young lady and the disappointed groom ouf i sent to ask will to come to me alone for a moment no he could not see me write to him slowly as though an aged infirm tottering man we heard him descending the steps how different from the step that carried him up we conscience stricken sat within with doors closed he was off he has again mounted his horse and the brokenhearted man hardly less cruel than the expectant bridegroom dashes the rowel in his side and disappears like a whirlwind i can fancy mothers and lillys agony when they hear of the wedding all clinton knew it last night and if they did too i know there was as little sleep for them as for us i know mother shrieked my child my child while lilly cried how could he believe she meant to marry him without even sending word to mother when he was going to the very town bah what a jolly go if those two got hysterics about the supposed moral suicide glad i was not at the teaparty well fearing the effect of such a shock in mothers nervous state gibbes advised miriam to go on the cars this evening and convince her that it had not occurred court records and licenses and minister to the contrary notwithstanding so my duck my angel she whom i call my peri with the singed wings children who play in the fire must expect to be burned set off on her pious errand without the protecting arm of her bridegroom i have had a shock while writing alone here almost all have gone to church i heard a step ascending the stair what i asked if it should be will then i blamed myself for supposing such a thing possible slowly it came nearer and nearer i raised my head and was greeted with a ghastly smile i held out my hand will sarah misery discards ceremony he stood before me the most woebegone heartbroken man i ever saw with a forced laugh he said where is my bride pshaw i know she has gone to clinton i have come to talk to you was nt it a merry wedding the hollow laugh rang again i tried to jest but failed sit down and let me talk to you i said he was in a wayward humor cut to the heart ready to submit to a touch of silk or to resist a grasp of iron this was the man i had to deal with and get from him something he clung to as to not his life but miriam and i know so little how to act in such a case know so little about dealing gently with wild natures he alarmed me at first his forced laugh ceased he said that he meant to keep that license always it was a joke on him yesterday but with that in his possession the tables would be turned on her he would show it to her occasionally it should keep her from marrying any one else i said that it would be demanded though he must deliver it the very devil shot in his eye as he exclaimed fiercely if any one dares demand it ill die before giving it up if god almighty came id say no ill die with it first o merciful father i thought what misery is to come of this jest he must relinquish it gibbes will force him into it or die in the attempt george would come from virginia jimmy would cross the seas and i was alone in here to deal with such a spirit i commenced gently would he do miriam such a wrong it was no wrong he said let him follow his own will you profess to love her i asked profess great god how can you i adore her i tell you that in spite of all this i love her not more that is impossible but as much as ever look at my face and ask that burst from him with the wildest impulse very well this girl you love then you mean to make miserable you stand forever between her and her happiness because you love her is this love he was sullenly silent i went on not only her happiness but her honor is concerned you who love her so do her this foul injury would it affect her reputation he asked ask yourself is it quite right that you should hold in your hands the evidence that she is mrs carter when you know she is not and never will be is it quite honorable in gods name would it injure miriam id rather die than grieve her my iron was melted but too hot to handle i put it on one side satisfied that i and i only had saved miriam from injury and three brothers from bloodshed by using his insane love as a lever it does not look as hard here as it was in reality but it was of the hardest struggles i ever had indeed it was desperate i had touched the right key and satisfied of success turned the subject to let him believe he was following his own suggestions when i told him he must free miriam from all blame that i had encouraged the jest against her repeated remonstrances and was alone to blame he generously took it on himself i was so crazy about her he said that i would have done it anyhow i would have run any risk for the faintest chance of obtaining her and much more to the same purpose that though very generous in him did not satisfy my conscience but he surprised me by saying that he was satisfied that if i had been in my room and he had walked into the parlor with the license she would have married him what infatuation he says though that i only prevented it that my influence by my mere presence is stronger than his words i dont say that is so but if i helped save her thank heaven it is impossible to say one half that passed but he showed me his determination to act just as he has heretofore and take it all as a joke that no blame might be attached to her besides id rather die than not see her i laugh but you dont know what i suffer poor fellow i saw it in his swimming eyes at last he got up to go before they returned from church beg her to meet me as she always has i told mrs worley that she must treat her just the same because i love her so and say i go to clinton tomorrow to have that record effaced and deliver up the license i would not grieve her indeed i love her too well his voice trembled as well as his lips he took my hand saying you are hard on me i could make her happy i know because i worship her so i have been crazy about her for three years you cant call it a mere fancy why are you against me but god bless you goodbye and he was gone why o will because i love my sister too much to see her miserable merely to make you happy my cripple friend that i mentioned so far back continues to send me the most affecting messages he is really wretched about me never was more distressed thinks of nothing else and so on through the whole list to cap the climax he sends me word that he can now walk on crutches and the first time he can venture in a buggy means to call on me que le ciel men prserve what could we talk about hisn and hern several misfortunes thats too bad every one teases me unmercifully about my new conquest i cant help but be amused and yet beware young girls of expressing sympathy even for soldiers there is no knowing what effect it may produce yesterday evening some time before sunset mr enders was announced to our great surprise as we knew he had been in clinton all the week having been transferred there instead of to jackson as he threatened he was the most miserable unhappy creature one could possibly imagine even too melancholy for me to laugh at him which expresses the last degree of wretchedness to all our questions he had but one answer that he had had the most dreadful attack of blues ever since he was here sunday that he had waited every evening at the cars expecting us and at last seeing that we had no intention of coming he could no longer stand the temptation so got permission to come down for a day to port hudson so he could come out to see us before we could fairly get him cheerful will carter and ned badger who returned only this week from kentucky entered will was in a bad humor and wanted to vent it on us so after waiting some time he proposed that the two young men should go with him pocketing at the same moment the cards which had won miriam and saying they would have a nice game together and just the rarest old whiskey he looked around to see the effect produced we girls did not move but mr enders said he must really return immediately to port hudson and start for clinton from there in the night will thought it would be such a triumph over us to carry him off that he insisted theyd have a fine time cure the blues etc ned was more than willing and at last mr enders said well he felt just so desperate that he did not care what he did he believed he would go i saw he was in a reckless humor and that will knew it too and i promised to make at least an effort to save him miriam spoke to him apart but he said he had promised now he must go will ran down triumphant to mount his horse calling him to follow all ran out to see him off when frank came back to tell me goodbye i seized the opportunity and did nt i plead i told him i would not ask him to stay here though he knew we would be happy to have him stay and begged him to go back to the camp and leave will alone i suggested other resources talked of his mother whom he idolizes pleaded like a grandmother and just as i wound up came wills voice from below why the devil dont you come enders hurry he moved a step looked at me i dropped my head without a word here i must confess to the most consummate piece of acting i am sorry but as long as it saved him from doing what i knew he would have cause to regret i am not ashamed of having tried it will called impatiently again as he stood hesitating before me i did not say stay i just gave the faintest sigh imaginable he went down and told will he would not go of course will went off in a rage with us monday dr woods and mr van ingen stopped just from their regiment in kentucky and on their way home and i begged so hard to see the doctor and promised so faithfully to retire if i suffered too much that mrs badger yielded like an angel and i carried my point the doctor we looked in vain at each other i for my dandy friend in irreproachable broadcloth immaculate shirt bosoms and perfect boots he for the brusque impulsive girl who in ordinary circumstances would have run dancing into the parlor would have given him halfglad halfindifferent greeting and then found either occasion to laugh at him or would have turned elsewhere for amusement we looked i say in vain before me stood my pattern of neatness in a rough uniform of brown homespun a dark flannel shirt replaced the snowy cambric one and there was neither cravat nor collar to mark the boundary line between his dark face and the still darker material and the dear little boots o ye gods and little fishes they were clumsy and mudspattered if my mouth twitched with laughter as i silently commented the doctors did not i who always danced on my way came in iying back on my pillows and wheeled in by a servant the doctors sympathy was really touching and poor consolation he gave when he heard the story you will recover to a certain extent but will feel it more or less all your life i am the ruin of all these puns the gentlemen will hate me i must learn to ignore their conundrums until they answer them themselves and to wait patiently for the pun instead of catching it and laughing before it is halfspoken why cant i do as the others do there was mr van ingen with his constant stream of them that i anticipated several times he said to me if i were asked what town in louisiana i would rather be in this evening what would my answer be i should have looked perfectly innocent and politely inquisitive but i did neither i saw the answer instantly and laughed ah you have guessed i can see it in your eyes he said of course i had but i told him i was afraid to say it for fear he might think i was flattering myself then we both laughed the place he referred to was bayou sarah yesterday being a beautiful day i was carried down in honor of christmas to meet captain fenner and mr duggan who were to dine with us the cars had brought miriam a beautiful little set of collars and cuffs from dellie and the oddest sweetest little set for me from morgan for our christmas gift it is all lilly we had an exquisite christmas gift the night before a magnificent serenade a compliment from colonel breaux it very singularly happened that miriam anna and ned badger were sitting up in the parlor watching alone for christmas when the band burst forth at the steps and startled them into a stampede upstairs but gibbes who came with the serenaders caught them and brought them back into the parlor where there were only eight gentlemen and in this novel unheardof style only these two girls with gibbes to play propriety entertained all these people at midnight while the band played without i commenced writing today expressly to speak of our pleasant christmas yet it seems as though i would write about anything except that since i have not come to it yet perhaps it is because i feel i could not do it justice at least i can say who was there at sunset came captain bradford and mr conn the first stalking in with all the assurance which a handsome face and fine person can lend the second following with all the timidity of a first appearance again after a long pause the door swung open and enter mr halsey who bows and takes the seat on the other side of me and mr bradford of colonel allen memory once more returned to his regiment who laughs shakes hands all around and looks as happy as a schoolboy just come home for the holidays who has neverending visions of plumcakes puddings and other sweet things while all goes on merrily another rap comes and enter santa claus dressed in the old uniform of the mexican war with a tremendous cocked hat and preposterous beard of false hair which effectually conceal the face and but for the mass of tangled short curls no one could guess that the individual was bud it was a device of the generals which took us all by surprise santa claus passes slowly around the circle and pausing before each lady draws from his basket a cake which he presents with a bow while to each gentleman he presents a wineglass replenished from a most suspiciouslooking black bottle which also reposes there leaving us all wonder and laughter santa claus retires with a basket much lighter than it had been at his entrance then follow refreshments and more and more talk and laughter until the clock strikes twelve when all these ghosts bid a hearty goodnight and retire 1863 why i have hardly become accustomed to writing 62 yet where has this year gone with all its troubles and anxieties it is the shortest i ever spent 61 and 62 together would hardly seem three hundred and sixtyfive days to me well let time fly every hour brings us nearer our freedom and we are two years nearer peace now than we were when south carolina seceded that is one consolation i learn to my unspeakable grief that the state house is burned down one just from baton rouge tells us that my presentiment about our house is verified yankees do inhabit it a yankee colonel and his wife they say they look strangely at home on our front gallery pacing up and down and a stranger and a yankee occupies our fathers place at the table where he presided for thirtyone years and the old lamp that lighted up so many eager laughing faces around the dear old table night after night that with its great beaming eye watched us one by one as we grew up and left our home that witnessed every parting and every meeting by which we sang read talked danced and made merry the lamp that hal asked for as soon as he beheld the glittering chandeliers of the new innovation gas the lamp that all agreed should go to me among other treasures and be cased in glass to commemorate the old days our old lamp has passed into the hands of strangers who neither know nor care for its history and mothers bed which with the table and fathers little ebony stand alone remained uninjured belongs now to a yankee woman father prized his ebony table he said he meant to have a gold plate placed in its centre with an inscription and i meant to have it done myself when he died so soon after a yankee now sips his tea over it just where some beau or beauty of the days of charles ii may have rested a laced sleeve or dimpled arm give the devil his due bless yankees for one thing they say they tried hard to save our state house am i not glad to get another blank book on sunday my old one gave out to my unspeakable distress and i would have been dsole if i had not had three or four letters to answer as writing is my chief occupation during my tedious illness o that unfortunate trip to port hudson have i not cause to remember and regret it two months last sunday since i have been lying here a cripple and i am not yet able to take a step however on monday mother sent dr woods as my fourth physician and i have made up my mind that either he or nature will effect a cure before long wonder how it feels to walk it makes me weary to see others try it i always fear that the exertion must be very painful an absurd idea which i endeavor to keep to myself that blessed mr halsey like an angel of mercy sent me kate coventry yesterday just when i was pining for a bonne bouche of some kind i did not care what whether a stick of candy or an equally palatable book it is delightful to have ones wishes realized as soon as they are made i think it rather caused me to relent towards mr halsey i did not feel half so belligerent as i did just the sunday before at all events i felt well enough to go down in the evening when he called again though i had been too indisposed to do so on a previous occasion o sarah wheeled into the parlor there i beheld not my friend alone but several other individuals whose presence rather startled me i found myself undergoing the terrors of an introduction to a colonel locke and to my unspeakable surprise major buckner was claiming the privilege of shaking hands with me and colonel steadman was on the other side and was that mr halsey o never the mr halsey i knew was shockingly careless of his dress never had his hair smooth let his beard grow as it would and wore a most ferocious slouched hat this one had taken more than one look at the glass a thing i should have imagined the other incapable of doing he had bestowed the greatest care and attention on his dress had brought his beard within reasonable limits had combed his hair with the greatest precision and held lightly in one hand an elegant little cap that i am sure must be provokingly becoming why he was handsome ah a some mistake surely i cried to myself my mr halsey was not certainly if it be i as i hope it may be ive a little dog at home who will surely know me i kept repeating i resolved to test the little dogs sagacity so i pretended to know this apparition and thanked him for the pleasure he had afforded me by sending me kate coventry he looked conscious and pleased the little dog had found out his identity i was more puzzled than ever how account for this wondrous change but metaphorphosed john talked he was expatiating at a most extraordinary rate and had been doing so for an hour after supper when gibbes drew his chair near me gibbes likes to hear what visitors say to his little sister whereupon timid mr halsey drew his slightly back and very soon after asked for his horse o gibbes you wretch what an amusing ttette you spoiled you innocent and the general of course only waited for his exit before beginning to tease me unmercifully i must put an end to this they shall not bring such unjust charges against him yet how am i to make them see reason i am more pleased tonight than i could well express i have been talking to an old and dear friend no other than will pinckney his arrival was as unexpected as it was agreeable the cry of here comes will pinckney sent me back to august 60 when the words were always the forerunner of fun and frolic he told me what he called his secrets of how he had been treated by the war department which has indeed behaved shockingly towards the colonel what a rush of visitors last night one would imagine they had all come by appointment expressly to have an impromptu dance which they certainly enjoyed by the way there was little captain c the susceptible and simple who so innocently says i seen and i done it without the faintest suspicion of the peculiarity and looks so sweet and guileless and amiable and soft that i cant help wondering if he would be sticky if i touch him indeed i think his hands stick at least for when he told me goodbye it was with the greatest difficulty that i extracted mine from his grasp he having forgotten to return it during a long farewell address and even when i succeeded in recovering it by being almost rude it was not released without a very sensible pressure from the putty or whatever it is that is so tenacious i am afraid it is rather a habit of his which has lost all force or meaning by being too frequently repeated then there was a horrid little wretch vulgar and underbred to my idea to whom i was introduced as mr g but here is lieutenant dupr whom i have not yet introduced though we have met before tall goodlooking a fine form and not a sparkling face i am inclined to believe that his chief merit lies in his legs certainly when he dances he puts his best foot forward and knows it too miriam who adores dancing is flirting openly with this divinity of the deux temps and polka and skims around with his arm about her position sanctified by the lively air lydia is dashing off on the piano with a grace and lightness only equaled by his own and lieutenant duggan with his good honest clever face which so unmistakably proclaims him tom we know already so no further description is needed captain fenner too is well known with his short though graceful figure his goodhumored intelligent face irresistible imperial and that roguish expression about that large mouth which displays such handsome teeth and seems to say dont trust me too far little captain c tells me a long story about how colonel steadman had come to him and asked if he believed it possible that miss morgan had put her life and happiness in the hands of a homeopathic physician how he considered her fate sealed and what a shame it was to trifle with such a sad affair at my age too ruined for life it was dreadful too sad hereupon as continuing the story he remarks that being asked his opinion by the colonel he agreed perfectly and thought with him it was an appalling sacrifice and oh all sorts of things anything just to make me miserable and unhappy well what is written will come to pass first comes a doctor with a butchering apparatus who cups and bleeds me unmercifully says ill walk ten days after and exit enter another croton oil and strychnine pills thatll set me up in two weeks and exit enter a third sounds my bones and pinches them from my head to my heels tells of the probability of a splinter of bone knocked off my left hip the possibility of paralysis in the leg the certainty of a seriously injured spine and the necessity for the most violent counterirritants follow blisters which sicken even disinterested people to look at and a trifle of suffering which i come very near acknowledging to myself enter the fourth inhuman butchery wonder they did not kill you take three drops a day out of this tiny bottle and presto in two weeks you are walking a fifth in the character of a friend says my dear young lady if you do your case is hopeless what wonder that i am puzzled a wiser head would be confused i want to believe all but how is it possible what will be will be bon here comes a note from mr halsey ah a lend him zaidee certainly here is a postscript three times the length of the note voyons will miss sarah make the annotations he requested in kate coventry he is anxious to have the ladys opinion on the questions of taste and propriety which so frequently occur in the book ill not attempt such a display yet there are several passages i am dying to mark one in particular speaking of the peculiarities of men of how they are always more at ease when they have their hands employed drawing confidence and conversation from a paperknife and book to tumble a pair of scissors and a thread to snip or even from imbibing the head of a cane i am anxious to call his attention to if i dared add to the list or a cord and tassel to play with this nervous mr halsey is wearing out my pretty blue tassel that frank admires so much he says he can talk better when he dangles it think the hint might save it in the future i am particularly happy today for we have just heard from brother for the first time since last july and he is well and happy and wants us to come to him in new orleans so he can take care of us and no longer be so anxious for our safety if we only could to be sure the letter is from a gentleman who is just out of the city who says he writes at brothers earnest request still it is something to hear even indirectly one hundred and fifty dollars he encloses with the request that mother will draw for any amount she wishes dear brother money is the least thing we need first of all we are dying for want of a home if we could only see ours once more during this time we have heard incidentally of brother of his having taken the oath of allegiance which i am confident he did not do until butlers october decree of his being a prominent union man of his being a candidate for the federal congress and of his withdrawal and finally of his having gone to new york and washington from which places he only returned a few weeks since that is all we ever heard a very few people have been insolent enough to say to me your brother is as good a yankee as any my blood boils as i answer let him be president lincoln if he will and i would love him the same and so i would politics cannot come between me and my fathers son what he thinks right is right for him though not for me if he is for the union it is because he believes it to be in the right and i honor him for acting from conviction rather than from dread of public opinion if he were to take up the sword against us tomorrow miriam and i at least would say if he thinks it his duty he is right we will not forget he is our fathers child and we will not from that sad day when the sun was setting for the first time on our fathers grave when the great strong man sobbed in agony at the thought of what we had lost and taking us both on his lap put his arms around us and said dear little sisters dont cry i will be father and brother too now he has been both he respects our opinions we shall respect his i confess myself a rebel body and soul confess i glory in it am proud of being one would not forego the title for any other earthly one though none could regret the dismemberment of our old union more than i did at the time though i acknowledge that there never was a more unnecessary war than this in the beginning yet once in earnest from the secession of louisiana i date my change of sentiment i have never since then looked back forward forward is the cry and as the federal states sink each day in more appalling folly and disgrace i grow prouder still of my own country and rejoice that we can no longer be confounded with a nation which shows so little fortitude in calamity so little magnanimity in its hour of triumph yes i am glad we are two distinct tribes am proud of my country only wish i could fight in the ranks with our brave soldiers to prove my enthusiasm would think death mutilation glorious in such a cause cry war to all eternity before we submit but if i cant fight being unfortunately a woman which i now regret for the first time in my life at least i can help in other ways what fingers can do in knitting and sewing for them i have done with the most intense delight what words of encouragement and praise could accomplish i have tried on more than one bold soldier boy and not altogether in vain i have lost my home and all its dear contents for our southern rights have stood on its deserted hearthstone and looked at the ruin of all i loved without a murmur almost glad of the sacrifice if it would contribute its mite towards the salvation of the confederacy and so it did indirectly for the battle of baton rouge which made the yankees drunk with rage commit outrages in our homes that civilized indians would blush to perpetrate forced them to abandon the town as untenable whereby we were enabled to fortify port hudson here which now defies their strength true they have reoccupied our town that yankees live in our house but if our generals said burn the whole concern would i not put the torch to our home readily though i love its bare skeleton still indeed i would though i know what it is to be without one dont lilly and mother live in a wretched cabin in vile clinton while strangers rest under our fathers roof yankees i owe you one for that well i boast myself rebel sing dixie shout southern rights pray for gods blessing on our cause without ceasing and would not live in this country if by any possible calamity we should be conquered i am only a woman and that is the way i feel brother may differ what then shall i respect love him less no god bless him union or secession he is always my dear dear brother and tortures could not make me change my opinion a whole week has passed since i opened this book a week certainly not spent in idleness if not a very interesting one for i have kept my room almost all the time leaving miriam and anna to entertain their guests alone even when mr halsey called on sunday i declined going down why i wonder i felt better than usual was in a splendid humor for talking yet my excuses took my place and i lay quietly in bed dreaming by the firelight and singing hymns to myself once in a while the thought would occur to me why dont i go down but it was always answered with a wry face and the hymn went on yet i knew he had come expecting to see me on the table near me stood a bunch of snowdrops that miriam had culled for her beloved captain bradford an idea struck me so suddenly that my voice died instantly the spirit of mischief had taken possession of me laughing to myself i caught them up drew three long bright hairs from my head they looked right goldy in the firelight and tied them around the flowers i thought i should never get to the end while wrapping them thus secured a servant carried them into the parlor with miss sarahs compliments to mr halsey poor miriams cry of surprise at finding her flowers thus appropriated reached my ears and caused me to laugh again it was rather cool but then it was better fun than going down and then did nt it flatter his vanity o men you vain creatures a woman would receive a whole bunch of hair and forty thousand bouquets without having her head turned while you well i heard enough from miriam to amuse me at all events and a day or two after captain bradford had a long story to tell her what he called a good joke on mr halsey of how he had found him kissing three long bright hairs in rapture and on asking where he got them received as an answer from the godblessedest little angel that ever wore long hair this blessedest little angel did not intend it as a souvenir and is consequently annoyed about stories of three hairs intended as a string and nothing more being wrapped in tissue paper and treasured up so goes the tale instead of being thrown into the fire as i certainly expected last night anna and miriam sat on my bed at twilight playing cards while i tried my guitar when captain c major spratley and lieutenant dupr were announced quick down went the cards as they sprang to their feet to throw off their neat calicoes where was miriams comb and grenadine and collar and belt good gracious where was her buckle on the bureau mantel washstand or under them please move a moment anna in such a hurry do there was anna wait im in a hurry too where is that pomatum you malvina if you dont help me ill there take that miss now fly around malvina with a faint dingy pink suddenly brought out on her pale seagreen face did fly around while i hushing my guitar in the tumult watch each running over the other in silent amazement wondering if order can come out of such confusion and if the people downstairs were worth all that trouble when i finally made my appearance in the parlor it was with the conviction that i would have a dreadfully stupid time and captain c too however though at first i had both soon only the last was left me some one suggested calling the spirits which game i had imagined played out long ago and we derived a great deal of amusement from it six of us around a small table invoked them with the usual ceremony there was certainly no trick played every finger was above the board and all feet sufficiently far from the single leg to insure fair play every rap seemed to come exactly from the centre of the table and was painfully distinct though not loud when asked if there was a writing medium present it indicated captain c i observed that he seemed averse to trying it but yielded at length and took the pencil in his hand nbsp our first question of course was how long before peace nine months was written which foreign nation would recognize us first france then england in eight months who was miriam to marry captain of a battery who we all shouted captain c e fenner was written again when in ten months i believe captain c to be honest about it he seemed to have no control over his hand and his arm trembled until it became exceedingly painful of course i do not actually believe in spiritualism but there is certainly something in it one cannot understand and mrs badgers experience is enough to convert one alone each was startled in turn by extraordinary revelations concerning themselves gibbes was to be transferred to the transmississippi department george would come home and all the gentlemen had the name and address of future sweethearts written in full the question was asked who will sarah morgan fall in love with every eye was on the pencil as a capital h was traced as the a followed i confess to a decided disgust at the spirits and was about to beg it might be discontinued when the rest followed rapidly until in three separate lines appeared has not seen him yet here came an exclamation of surprise from lydia and miriam who knew how true it was and even gibbes looked astonished captain in virginia captain charles lewis a perfect buzz of comments followed every one asked every one else if they knew any one by that name and every one said no gibbes was decidedly more interested than i that odd has not seen him yet expressing so exactly the fact that i pride myself upon carried conviction in the truth of spirits almost who will she marry asked gibbes he has a pet belief in which i encourage him that i will never marry again came the name as distinctly as before of captain charles lewis when will she marry him in june 1864 was the answer i was to meet him in new orleans november followed after a period of course the spirits produced some slight commotion which made the time pass pleasantly until miriam began to waltz with her monsieur deux temps then captain c told me why he had been unwilling to try it of how his father believed so strongly in it that he had very nearly been made crazy by it and how he had sworn to abandon the practice of consulting them seeing the effect produced he did not believe in spirits himself but could not account for the influence he was under when he saw his hand involuntarily write things he was totally unconscious of himself however he proposed that we two should have a private consultation with them which i opened by asking when i should again see my home i know he did not know anything about it but on the paper appeared five months have gone five months more it is just five months since i did see home i think it was the 26th of august that charlie took me there he asked if he should ever marry never you will be jilted by the lady you love in missouri miss christina p i pointed it out to him as he happened to be looking at me when it was written it surprised him into saying why im engaged to her i asked whose spirit was communicating with us he was watching the dance when his hand wrote john c i laughed and asked if there was such a person pointing to the name he looked actually sick as he said yes my brother he is dead i had not the heart to talk of spirits again so we took to writing poetry together every alternate line falling to my lot it made an odd jingle the sentimental first line being turned to broad farce by my absurd second one a letter from lavinia has come to me all the way from california how happy it made me though written so long ago only the 30th of june lavinia has changed changed there is a sad wornout tone in every line it sounds old as though she had lived years and years ago and was writing as though she were dead and buried long since lavinia whose letters used to keep me in sunshine for weeks at a time well no wonder she is sad all these dreary years from home with so faint a hope of ever again seeing it and all these sorrows and troubles that have befallen us combined are not calculated to make her happy but i wish she had kept her cheerful heart well perhaps it is easier for us to be cheerful and happy knowing the full extent of our calamities than it is for her knowing so little and having just cause to fear so much courage better days are coming and then ill have many a funny tale to tell her of the days when the yankees kept us on the qui vive or made us run for our lives it will tell merrily be almost as lively as those running days were one of my chief regrets over my helplessness is that i will not be able to run in the next stampede i used to enjoy it oh the days gone by the dreary days when cut off from our own people and surrounded by yankees we used to catch up any crumb of news favorable to our side that was smuggled into town and the brunots and i would write each other little dispatches of consolation and send them by little negroes those were dismal days yet how my spirits would rise when the long roll would beat and we would prepare for flight a letter from my dear little jimmy how glad i am words could not express this is the first since he arrived in england and now we know what has become of him at last while awaiting the completion of the ironclad gunboat to which he has been appointed like a trump he has put himself to school and studies hard which is evident from the great improvement he already exhibits in his letter my delight at hearing from jimmy is overcast by the bad news lilly sends of mothers health i have been unhappy about her for a long while her health has been wretched for three months so bad that during all my long illness she has never been with me after the third day i was never separated from mother for so long before and i am homesick and heartsick about her only twenty miles apart and she with a shocking bone felon in her hand and that dreadful cough unable to come to me whilst i am iying helpless here as unable to get to her i feel right desperate about it this evening lilly writes of her having chills and fevers and looking very very badly so miriam started off instantly to see her my poor mother she will die if she stays in clinton i know she will gibbes has gone back to his regiment i cant say how dreary i felt when he came to tell me goodbye i did not mean to cry but how could i help it when he put his arms around me mother has come to me o how glad i was to see her this morning and the georgia project which i dared not speak of for fear it should be mere talk and nothing more is a reality yes we are actually going i can hardly believe that such good fortune as getting out of that wretched clinton really awaits us perhaps i shall not like augusta either a stranger in a strange city is not usually enchanted with everything one beholds but still a change of scene a new country new people it is worth while shall we really go will some page in this book actually record augusta georgia no i dare not believe it yet the mere thought has given me strength within the last two weeks to attempt to walk learning to walk at my age is it not amusing but the smallest baby knows more about it than i did at first of course i knew one foot was to be put before the other but the question was how it was to be done when they would not go i have conquered that difficulty however and can now walk almost two yards if some one holds me fast sunset will pinckney has this instant left ever since dinner he has been vehemently opposing the georgia move insisting that it will cost me my life by rendering me a confirmed cripple he says he could take care of me but no one else can so i must not be moved i am afraid his arguments have about shaken mothers resolution pshaw it will do me good i must go it will not do to remain here twentyseven thousand yankees are preparing to march on port hudson and this place will certainly be either occupied by them or burned to go to clinton is to throw myself in their hands so why not one grand move to augusta here goes news has been received that the yankees are already packed ready to march against us at any hour if i was up and well how my heart would swell with exultation as it is it throbs so with excitement that i can scarcely lie still hope amounts almost to presumption at port hudson they are confident that our fifteen thousand can repulse twice the number great god i say it with all reverence if we could defeat them if we could scatter capture annihilate them my heart beats but one prayer victory i shall grow wild repeating it in the mean time though linwood is in danger this dear place my second home its loved inhabitants think of their being in such peril oh i shall cry heartily if harm comes to them but i must leave before no use of leaving my bones for the yankees to pick better sing dixie in georgia tomorrow consequently i go to that earthly paradise clinton thence to be reshipped so goes the present programme to augusta in three days and no time for adieux wonder who will be surprised who vexed and who will cry over the unforeseen separation not a single goodbye nothing except an old brass button that mr halsey gave me as a souvenir in case he should be killed in the coming assault it is too bad ah destiny destiny where do you take us during these two trying years i have learned to feel myself a mere puppet in the hands of a something that takes me here today tomorrow there always unexpectedly and generally very unwillingly but at last leads me somewhere or other right side up with care after a thousand troubles and distresses the hand of destiny is on me now where will it lead me meeting miriam by mere accident on the road last evening and hearing of our surprising journey to georgia mr halsey came to spend a last evening with us and say goodbye what a deluge of regrets hopes fears etc perfectly overwhelming why had i not told him of it the night before all our friends would be so disappointed at not having an opportunity of saying goodbye if the yankees would only postpone their attack so he might accompany us but no matter he would come on in two months and meet us there and would we not write to him thank you miriam may but i shall hardly do so we had such a pleasant evening together talking over our trip then we had a dozen songs on the guitar gay sad and sentimental then he gave me a sprig of jessamine as a keepsake and i ripped open my celebrated runningbag to get a real for true silver five cents a perfect curiosity in these days which i gave him in exchange and which he promised to wear on his watchchain he and miriam amused themselves examining the contents of my sack and laughing at my treasures the wretches then camegoodbye i think he was sorry to see us go well he ought to miss us ah these farewells today i bid adieu to linwood it may be for years and it may be forever this goodbye will cost me a sigh here we are still in spite of our expectations difficulty on difficulty arose and an hour before the cars came it was settled that mother should go to clinton and make the necessary arrangements and leave us to follow in a day or two two days more miriam no more objected than i did so mother went alone poor miriam went to bed soon after very ill so ill that she lay groaning in bed at dusk when a stir was heard in the hall below and colonel steadman major spratley and mr dupr were announced presto up she sprang and flew about in the most frantic style emptying the trunk on the floor to get her prettiest dress and acting as though she had never heard of pains and groans when we leave how much i shall miss the fun of seeing her and anna running over each other in their excitement of dressing for their favorites annas first exclamation was aint you glad you did nt go and certainly we were not sorry from mere compassion for what would she have done with all three if i laughed at their extra touches to their dresses it did not prevent me from bestowing unusual attention on my own and by way of bravado when i was carried down i insisted on mrs badger lending me her arm to let me walk into the parlor and prove to colonel steadman that in spite of his prophecies i was able to take a few steps at least his last words you wont go will you think once more sent me upstairs wondering thinking undecided and unsatisfied hardly knowing what to do or what to say every time i tried to sleep those calm deep honest gray eyes started up before my closed ones and that earnest you wont go will you think once more rang in my ears like a solemn warning hopes of seeing georgia grew rather faint that night is it lawful to risk my life but is it not better to lose it while believing that i have still a chance of saving it by going than to await certain death calmly and unresisting in clinton id rather die struggling for this life this beautiful loved blessed life that god has given me i had so many nice things to say which now alas are knocked forever from my head when news came that the yankees were advancing on us and were already within fifteen miles the panic which followed reminded me forcibly of our running days in baton rouge each one rapidly threw into trunks all clothing worth saving with silver and valuables to send to the upper plantation i sprang up determined to leave instantly for clinton so mother would not be alarmed for our safety but before i got halfway dressed helen carter came in and insisted on my remaining declaring that my sickness and inability to move would prove a protection to the house and save it from being burned over their heads put on that plea though i have no faith in melting the bowels of compassion of a yankee myself i consented to remain as miriam urgently represented the dangers awaiting clinton so she tossed all we owned into our trunk to send to mother as hostage of our return and it is now awaiting the cars my earthly possessions are all reposing by me on the bed at this instant consisting of my guitar a change of clothes runningbag cabas and this book for in spite of their entreaties i would not send it to clinton expecting those already there to meet with a fiery death though i would like to preserve those of the most exciting year of my life they tell me that this will be read aloud to me to torment me but i am determined to burn it if there is any danger of that why i would die without some means of expressing my feelings in the stirring hours so rapidly approaching i shall keep it by me such bustle and confusion every one hurried anxious excited whispering packing trunks sending them off wondering negroes looking on in amazement until ordered to mount the carts waiting at the door which are to carry them too away how disappointed the yankees will be at finding only white girls instead of their dear sisters and brothers whom they love so tenderly sorry for their disappointment they say they are advancing in overwhelming numbers that is nothing so long as god helps us and from our very souls we pray his blessing on us in this our hour of need for myself i cannot yet fully believe they are coming it would be a relief to have it over i have taken the responsibility of lydias jewelry on my shoulders and hope to be able to save it in the rush which will take place down at the cars miriam met frank enders going to clinton in charge of a car full of yankees deserters who came into our lines he thinks just as i do that our trunks are safer here than there now that they are all off we all agree that it was the most foolish thing we could have done these yankees interfere with all our arrangements i am almost ashamed to confess what an absurdly selfish thought occurred to me a while ago i was lamenting to myself all the troubles that surround us the dangers and difficulties that perplex us thinking of the probable fate that might befall some of our brave friends and defenders in port hudson when i thought too of the fun we would miss horrid was it not but worse than that i was longing for something to read when i remembered frank told me he had sent to alexandria for bulwers strange story for me and then i unconsciously said how i wish it would get here before the yankees i am very anxious to read it but confess i am ashamed of having thought of it at such a crisis so i toss up the farthing frank gave me for a keepsake the other day and say ill try in future to think less of my own comfort and pleasure poor mr halsey what a sad fate the pets he procures for me meet he stopped here just now on his way somewhere and sent me a curious bundle with a strange story by miriam it seems he got a little flyingsquirrel for me to play with must know my partiality for pets and last night while attempting to tame him the little creature bit his finger whereupon he naturally let him fall on the ground temper which put a period to his existence he had the nerve to skin him after the foul murder and sent all that remains of him out to me to prove his original intention the softest longest prettiest fur and such a duck of a tail poor little animal could nt have been larger than my fist wonder if its spirit will meet with that of the little bird which flew heavenward with all that pink ribbon and my letter from mr halsey they are coming the yankees are coming at last for four or five hours the sound of their cannon has assailed our ears there that one shook my bed oh they are coming god grant us the victory they are now within four miles of us on the big road to baton rouge on the road from town to clinton we have been fighting since daylight at readbridge and have been repulsed fifteen gunboats have passed vicksburg they say it will be an awful fight no matter with gods help well conquer yet again the report comes nearer oh they are coming coming to defeat i pray god only we seven women remain in the house the general left this morning to our unspeakable relief they would hang him we fear if they should find him here mass gene has gone to his company we are left alone here to meet them if they will burn the house they will have to burn me in it for i cannot walk and i know they shall not carry me im resigned if i should burn i have friends and brothers enough to avenge me create such a consternation better than being thrown from a buggy only id not survive to hear of it letter from lilly today has distressed me beyond measure starvation which threatened them seems actually at their door with more money than they could use in ordinary times they can find nothing to purchase not a scrap of meat in the house for a week no pork no potatoes fresh meat obtained once as a favor and poultry and flour articles unheard of besides that tiche crippled and margret very ill while liddy has run off to the yankees heaven only knows what will become of them the other day we were getting ready to go to them thursday when the general disapproved of my running such a risk saying hed call it a d piece of nonsense if i asked what he thought so we remained they will certainly starve soon enough without our help and yet i feel we should all be together still that last superfluous word is the refrain of gibbess song that is ringing in my ears and that i am chanting in a kind of ecstasy of excitement then let the cannon boom as it will well be gay and happy still and we will be happy in spite of yankee guns only my dear this that and the other at port hudson how i pray for your safety god spare our brave soldiers and lead them to victory i write touch my guitar talk pick lint and pray so rapidly that it is hard to say which is my occupation i sent frank some lint the other day and a bundle of it for mr halsey is by me hope neither will need it but to my work again it has come at last what an awful sound i thought i had heard a bombardment before but baton rouge was childs play compared to this at halfpast eleven came the first gun at least the first i heard and i hardly think it could have commenced many moments before instantly i had my hand on miriam and at my first exclamation mrs badger and anna answered all three sprang to their feet to dress while all four of us prayed aloud such an incessant roar and at every report the house shaking so and we thinking of our dear soldiers the dead and dying and crying aloud for gods blessing on them and defeat and overthrow to their enemies that dreadful roar i cant think fast enough they are too quick to be counted we have all been in mrs carters room from the last window of which we can see the incessant flash of the guns and the great shooting stars of flame which must be the hot shot of the enemy there is a burning house in the distance the second one we have seen tonight for yankees cant prosper unless they are pillaging honest people already they have stripped all on their road of cattle mules and negroes gathered in a knot within and without the window we six women up here watched in the faint starlight the flashes from the guns and silently wondered which of our friends were iying stiff and dead and then shuddering at the thought betook ourselves to silent prayer i think we know what it is to wrestle with god in prayer we had but one thought yet for women we took it almost too coolly no tears no cries no fear though for the first five minutes everybodys teeth chattered violently mrs carter had her husband in fenners battery the hottest place if they are attacked by the land force and yet to my unspeakable relief she betrayed no more emotion than we who had only friends there we know absolutely nothing when does one ever know anything in the country but we presume that this is an engagement between our batteries and the gunboats attempting to run the blockade firing has slackened considerably all are to lie down already dressed but being in my nightgown from necessity i shall go to sleep though we may expect at any instant to hear the tramp of yankee cavalry in the yard to my unspeakable surprise i waked up this morning and found myself alive once satisfied of that and assuring myself of intense silence in the place of the great guns which rocked me to sleep about halfpast two this morning i began to doubt that i had heard any disturbance in the night and to believe i had written a dream within a dream and that no bombardment had occurred but all corroborate my statement so it must be true and this portentous silence is only the calm before the storm i am half afraid the land force wont attack we can beat them if they do but suppose they lay siege to port hudson and starve us out that is the only way they can conquer we hear nothing still that is reliable just before daylight there was a terrific explosion which electrified every one save myself i was sleeping so soundly that i did not hear anything of it though mrs badger says that when she sprang up and called me i talked very rationally about it and asked what it could possibly be thought that i had ceased talking in my sleep miriam was quite eloquent in her dreams before the attack crying aloud see see what do i behold as though she were witnessing a rehearsal of the scene to follow later dr kennedy has just passed through and was within the fortifications last night brings news which is perhaps reliable as it was obtained from gardiner it was as we presumed the batteries and gunboats one we sunk another the mississippi we disabled so that the yankees had to abandon and set fire to her thirtynine prisoners falling into our hands it was her magazine that exploded this morning two other boats succeeded in passing though badly crippled our batteries fired gallantly hurrah for colonel steadman i know his was by no means the least efficient clinton they say will inevitably be sacked alas for mother and lilly what can we do the whole country is at the mercy of the yankees as long as gardiner keeps within the fortifications six miles below here they entered mr newports pulled the pillowcases from the beds stuffed them with his clothes and helped themselves generally what can we expect here to tell the truth i should be disappointed if they did not even look in at us on their marauding expedition on dit the yankees have gone back to baton rouge hearing we had sixty thousand men coming down after them i believe i am positively disappointed i did want to see them soundly thrashed the light we thought was another burning house was that of the mississippi they say the shrieks of the men when our hot shells fell among them and after they were left by their companions to burn were perfectly appalling another letter from lilly has distressed me beyond measure she says the one chicken and two dozen eggs miriam and i succeeded in buying from the negroes by prayers and entreaties saved them from actual hunger and for two days they had been living on one egg apiece and some cornbread and syrup great heavens has it come to this nothing to be bought in that abominable place for love or money where the next meal comes from nobody knows early last evening the tremendous clatter of a sword that made such unnecessary noise that one might imagine the owner thereof had betaken himself to the favorite pastime of his childhood and was prancing in on his murderous weapon having mistaken it for his war steed announced the arrival of captain bradford who with two friends came to say adieu those vile yankees have been threatening ponchatoula and his battery with a regiment of infantry was on its way there to drive them back the captain sent me word of the distressing departure with many assurances that he would take care of my john scarcely had he departed when lo john arrives and speaks for himself yes he is going only a moment to say goodbye sunset approaches well he must say goodbye now chorus of young ladies oh will you not spend the evening with us you can easily overtake the battery later chorus of married ladies you must not think of going here is a comfortable room at your service and after an early breakfast you can be on the road as soon as the others no necessity for prayers he readily consents and yet as the evening wore on when we laughed loudest i could not help but think of poor little mrs mcphaul sitting alone and crying over her brothers departure fancying his precious bones iying on the damp ground with only the soldiers roof the blue vault of heaven above while two miles away he sat in a comfortable parlor amusing himself about sunrise while the most delightful dreams floated through my brain a little voice roused me exclaiming sady sady john hawsey say so say give sady i opened my eyes to see little gibbes standing by me trying to lay some flowers on my cheek his little face sparkling with delight at his own importance a halfopened rosebud with the faintest blush of pink on its creamy leaves a pink and a piece of arbor vit all sprinkled with dew this was my bouquet the servant explained that mr halsey had just left and sent me that with his last goodbye and he has gone and now theres nothing left but weeping his face i neer shall see and naught is left to me save putting away my book and all recollections of nonsense so here goes to be or not to be thats the question whether t is nobler in the confederacy to suffer the pangs of unappeasable hunger and neverending trouble or to take passage to a yankee port and there remaining end them which is best i am so near daft that i cannot pretend to say i only know that i shudder at the thought of going to new orleans and that my heart fails me when i think of the probable consequence to mother if i allow a mere outward sign of patriotism to overbalance what should be my first consideration her health for clinton is growing no better rapidly to be hungry is there an everyday occurrence for ten days mother writes they have lived off just hominy enough to keep their bodies and souls from parting without being able to procure another article not even a potato mother is not in a condition to stand such privation day by day she grows weaker on her new regimen i am satisfied that two months more of danger difficulties perplexities and starvation will lay her in her grave the latter alone is enough to put a speedy end to her days lilly has been obliged to put her children to bed to make them forget they were supperless and when she followed their example could not sleep herself for very hunger we have tried in vain to find another home in the confederacy after three days spent in searching augusta gibbes wrote that it was impossible to find a vacant room for us as the city was already crowded with refugees a kind providence must have destined that disappointment in order to save my life if there is any reason for colonel steadmans fears we next wrote to mobile brandon and even that horrid little liberty besides making inquiries of every one we met while charlie too was endeavoring to find a place and everywhere received the same answer not a vacant room and provisions hardly to be obtained at all the question has now resolved itself to whether we shall see mother die for want of food in clinton or by sacrificing an outward show of patriotism the inward sentiment cannot be changed go with her to new orleans as brother begs in the few letters he contrives to smuggle through it looks simple enough ought not mothers life to be our first consideration undoubtedly but suppose we could preserve her life and our free sentiments at the same time if we could only find a restingplace in the confederacy this though is impossible but to go to new orleans to cease singing dixie to be obliged to keep your sentiments to yourself for i would not wound brother by any ultrasecession speech and such could do me no good and only injure him if he is as friendly with the federals as they say he is to listen to the scurrilous abuse heaped on those fighting for our homes and liberties among them my three brothers could i endure it i fear not even if i did not go crazy i would grow so restless homesick and miserable that i would pray for even clinton again oh i dont dont want to go if mother would only go alone and leave us with lilly but she is as anxious to obtain dr stones advice for me as we are to secure her a comfortable home and i wont go anywhere without miriam so we must all go together yet there is no disguising the fact that such a move will place us in a very doubtful position to both friends and enemies however all our friends here warmly advocate the move and will pinckney and frank both promised to knock down any one who shrugged their shoulders and said anything about it but what would the boys say the fear of displeasing them is my chief distress george writes in the greatest distress about my prolonged illness and his alarm about my condition of one thing i am sure he writes and that is that she deserves to recover for a better little sister never lived god bless him my eyes grew right moist over those few words loving words bring tears to them sooner than angry ones would he object to such a step when he knows that the very medicines necessary for my recovery are not to be procured in the whole country would he rather have mother dead and me a cripple in the confederacy than both well out of it i feel that if we go we are wrong but i am satisfied that it is worse to stay it is a distressing dilemma to be placed in as we are certain to be blamed whichever course we pursue but i dont want to go to new orleans before i had time to lay down my pen this evening general gardiner and major wilson were announced and i had to perform a hasty toilette before being presentable the first remark of the general was that my face recalled many pleasant recollections that he had known my family very well but that time was probably beyond my recollection and he went on talking about father and lavinia until i felt quite comfortable with this utter stranger i would prefer his speaking of our recent success at port hudson to my for we each man woman and child feel that we share the glory of sinking the gunboats and sending banks back to baton rouge without venturing on an attack and it seemed odd to hear any one assume the responsibility of the whole affair and say my success so unconsciously but this may be the privilege of generals i am no judge as this is the first confederate general i have had the pleasure of seeing wish it had been old stonewall i grow enthusiastic every time i think of the dear old fellow i am indebted to general gardiner for a great piece of kindness though i was telling him of how many enemies he had made among the ladies by his strict regulations that now rendered it almost impossible for the gentlemen to obtain permission to call on them when he told me if i would signify to my friends to mention when they applied that their visit was to be here and not elsewhere that he would answer for their having a pass whenever they called for one merci au compliment mais cest trop tard monsieur i believe that it is for true that we are to leave for new orleans via clinton and ponchatoula this evening clinton at least i am sure of lilly came down for me yesterday and according to the present programme though i will not answer for it in an hour from now we leave linwood this evening and clinton on thursday i am almost indifferent about our destination my chief anxiety is to have some definite plans decided on which seems perfectly impossible from the number of times they are changed a day the uncertainty is really affecting my spine and causing me to grow alarmingly thin our last adieux are said and linwood is left behind it may be for years and it may be forever my last hours were spent lying on the sofa on the gallery with lydia at my feet helen carter sitting on the floor at my side while all the rest were gathered around me as i played for the last time the centre of attraction i grew almost lachrymose as i bid a last adieu to the bed where i have spent so many months as they carried me downstairs wonder if it will not miss me it must have been at least five before the cars returned mrs carter grew quite pathetic as they approached while poor little lydia with streaming eyes and choking sobs clung first to miriam and then to me as though we parted to meet only in eternity all except her mother started in a run for the big gate while i was carried to the buggy through the group of servants gathered to say goodbye when the general drove me off rapidly what a delightful sensation is motion after five months inaction the last time i was in a vehicle was the night general beales ambulance brought me to linwood a helpless bundle last november it seemed to me yesterday that i could again feel the kind gentlemans arm supporting me and his wondering sympathetic tone as he repeated every halfmile really miss morgan you are very patient and uncomplaining good kind president miller as though all the trouble was not his just then but stopping at the gate roused me from my short reverie and i opened my eyes to find myself stationary and in full view of a train of cars loaded with soldiers literally covered with them for they covered the roof as well as filled the interior while half a dozen open cars held them seated one above the other in miniature pyramids and even the engine was graced by their presence abashed with finding myself confronted with so many people my sensation became decidedly alarming as a dozen rude voices cried go on we wont stop and a chorus of the opposition cried yes we will no yes they cried in turn and as the general stood me on the ground i would have walked if it had been my last attempt in life i paused irresolute not knowing whether to advance or retreat before the storm i must say they are the only rude soldiers i have yet seen in confederate uniforms but as i walked slowly clinging to the generals arm half from fear and half from weakness they ceased the unnecessary dispute and remained so quiet that i was more frightened still and actually forgot to say goodbye to mrs carter and mrs worley as they stood by the road how both the general and i escaped being hurt as he raised me on the platform every one is at a loss to account for i experienced only what may be called slight pain in comparison to what i have felt but really fear that the exertion has disabled him for today it must have been very severe some officers led me to my seat lilly miriam and anna got in the general kissed us heartily with damp eyes and kind wishes the cars gave a whistle and i put my head out of the window to see mrs carter industriously applying white cambric to her face which occupation she relinquished to call out last goodbyes another whistle and a jerk and we were off leaving her and mrs worley surrounded by children and servants using their handkerchiefs to wipe tears and wave farewell while the general waved his hat for goodbye then green hedges rapidly changing took their place and linwood was out of sight before we had ceased saying and thinking god bless the kind hearts we had left behind can i ever forget the kindness we have met among them to see green trees and wild flowers once more after such an illness is a pleasure that only those long deprived of such beauties by a similar misfortune can fully appreciate it was a relief to discover that what i had thought shocking rudeness in the soldiers had not been reserved for me alone for every time we stopped the same cry of no waiting for slow people was raised varied by constant expostulations with the engine for drinking ponds dry and mild suggestions as to taking the road the other side of the fence which would no doubt prove smoother than the track these arkansas troops have acquired a reputation for roughness and ignorance which they seem to cultivate as assiduously as most people would their virtues but rudeness does not affect their fighting qualities we arrived here about five last evening and strange to say the journey fatiguing as it was has not altogether disabled me but i must go back to clinton to account for this new change it would never do to take more than a hundred miles at a single jump without speaking of the incidents by the way numerous and pleasant as they were some way they have unaccountably paled and things that seemed so extremely amusing and afforded me so much pleasure during these four days now seem to be absurd trifles half forgotten i now remember lying in state on lillys bed wednesday talking to mrs badger who had been several days in town anna sarah ripley and the others when frank suddenly bolted in just from port hudson to say another goodbye though i told him goodbye at linwood sunday presently the general entered just from linwood to see us off then mr marston and his daughter and mr neafus all as kind as possible until a perfect levee was assembled which i iying all dressed with a shawl thrown over me enjoyed all the more as i could take my ease and have my fun at the same time frank sitting by my pillow talked dolorously of how much he would miss us and threatened to be taken prisoner before long in order to see us again when we were finally left alone i fancy there was very little sleep in the house as to me i lay by lilly wide awake thinking how lonely she would be without us and perfectly dsole at the idea of leaving the confederacy the dear gray coats included so when it was almost sunrise there was no necessity of rousing me to dress as i was only too glad to leave my sleepless bed before i got dressed anna her mother and sarah ripley came in again then miss comstock and just as i had put the last touch to my dress the gentlemen of the night before entered and we had almost an hour and a halfs respite before the carriage less punctual than we drove to the door the general picked me up in his arms and carried me once more to the carriage then the servants had to say goodbye then lilly very quiet very red and dissolved in tears clung to me almost without a word hardly able to speak whilst i distressed and grieved as i was had not a tear in my eyes nothing but a great lump in my throat that i tried to choke down in order to talk to frank who stood at the window by me after she left how the distance lengthens between us i raise up from my pillows and find myself at camp moore at four oclock forty miles are passed over goodbye frank from camp moore we had to go three miles back to find captain gilmans house where we were expected the gentleman is a friend of gibbes though i had never seen any of them before such a delightful place with everything looking so new and cool and such a hospitable hostess that i thought everything charming in spite of my fatigue i had hardly a moment to look around for immediately we were shown to our rooms and in a very few minutes miriam had me undressed and in bed the most delightful spot in the world to me just then while congratulating myself on having escaped death on the roadside i opened my eyes to behold a tray brought to my bedside with a variety of refreshments coffee bread loafsugar preserves i opened my mouth to make an exclamation at the singular optical illusion but wisely forbore speaking and shut it with some of the unheardof delicacies instead early next morning the same routine was gone through as thursday morning again the carriage drove to the door and we were whisked off to camp moore where the engine stood snorting with impatience to hurry us off to ponchatoula soon we were steaming down the track i reclining on my pillows in an interesting state of invalidism sadly abashed now and then at the courteous wondering gaze of the soldiers who were aboard having very little idea of the geography of that part of the country and knowing we were to take a carriage from some point this side of ponchatoula fancying how surprised mr halsey would be to hear we had passed him on the way i took a card from my travelingcase and wrote a few words for goodbye as we could not see him again i sealed it up and put it in my pocket to send to the first postoffice we passed about twelve oclock we stopped at hammond which was our place to disembark mother sent out to hire a negro to carry me off the platform and while waiting in great perplexity a young officer who had just seated himself before me got up and asked if he could assist her seizing an arm full of cloaks as he spoke i got up and walked to the door to appear independent and make believe i was not the one when mother begged him not to trouble himself she wanted a man to assist her daughter who was sick calling a friend the gentleman kindly loaded him with the cloaks etc while he hurried out after me i was looking ruefully at the impracticable step which separated me from the platform the question of how i was to carry out my independent notions began to perplex me allow me to assist you said a voice at my elbow i turned and beheld the handsome officer thank you i think i can get down alone pray allow me to lift you over this place much obliged but your arm will suffice sarah let the gentleman carry you you know you cannot walk said my very improper mother i respectfully declined the renewed offer dont pay any attention to her pick her up just as you would a child said my incorrigible mother the gentleman turned very red while miriam asserts i turned extremely white the next thing i knew by passing his arm around my waist or taking me by my arms i was so frightened that i have but a confused idea of it i was lifted over the intervening gulf and landed on the platform hammond boasts of four houses one a shoe manufactory stood about twenty or thirty yards off and there the gentleman proposed to conduct me again he insisted on carrying me and resolutely refusing i pronounced myself fully equal to the walk and accepting his proffered arm walked off with dignity and selfpossession he must have fancied that the injury was in my hand for holding my arm so that my entire weight must have been thrown on him not satisfied with that support with his other hand he held mine so respectfully and so carefully that i could not but smile as it struck me which by the way was not until i reached the house discovering that he belonged to colonel simontons command i asked him to take mr halsey the note i had written an hour before he pronounced himself delighted to be of the slightest service and seeing that we were strangers traveling unprotected asked if we had secured a conveyance to take us beyond we told him no he modestly suggested that some gentleman might attend to it for us he would be happy to do anything in his power i thought again of mr halsey and said if he would mention we were in hammond he would be kind enough to see to it for us may i ask your name he asked evidently surprised to find himself asking a question he was dying to know i gave him my card whereupon mother asked his name which he told us was howard we had been talking for some ten minutes when feeling rather uncomfortable at being obliged to look up at such a tall man from my low seat to relieve my neck as well as to shade my face from any further scrutiny i put down my head while i was still speaking instantly so quietly naturally and unobtrusively did he stoop down by me on one knee so that his face was in full view of mine that the action did not seem to me either singular or impertinent in fact i did not think of it until mother spoke of it after he left after a few moments it must have struck him for he got up and made his parting bow departing as i afterwards heard to question tiche as to how i had been hurt and declaring that it was a dreadful calamity to happen to so lovely a young lady having nothing to do i may as well go on with the history of our wanderings when the cars were moving off with the handsome mr howard mother turned to a gentleman who seemed to own the place and asked to be shown the hotel he went out and presently returning with a chair and two negroes quietly said he would take us to his own house the hotel was not comfortable and without listening to remonstrances led the way to a beautiful little cottage where he introduced his wife mrs cate who received us most charmingly and had me in bed before five minutes had elapsed i dont know how any one can believe the whole world so wicked for my part i have met none but the kindest people imaginable i dont know any wicked ones before half an hour had passed a visitor was announced so i gathered up my weary bones and with scarcely a peep at the glass walked to the parlor i commenced laughing before i got there and the visitor smiled most absurdly too for it was mr halsey it seemed so queer to meet in this part of the world that we laughed again after shaking hands it was odd i was thinking how much amused the general would be to hear of it for he had made a bet that we would meet when i asserted that we would not after the first few remarks he told me of how he had heard of our arrival a gentleman had walked into camp asking if a mr halsey was there he signified that he was the gentleman whereupon the other drew out my note saying a young lady on the cars had requested him to deliver it instantly recognizing the chirography he asked where i was hammond this is her name replied the other extending to him my card thinking as he modestly confessed that i had intended it only for him mr halsey coolly put it into his pocket and called for his horse mr howard lingered still apparently having something to say which he found difficult to put in words at last as the other prepared to ride off with a tremendous effort he managed to say the young ladys card is mine if it is all the same to you i should like to have it returned apologizing for the mistake mr halsey returned it feeling rather foolish i should imagine and rode on to the village leaving as he avers mr howard looking enviously after the lucky dog who was going to see such a young lady he told me something that slightly disgusted me with captain bradford it was that when he reached the bivouac the next morning after leaving linwood the captain had put him under arrest for having stayed there all night it was too mean considering that it is more than probable that he himself remained at mrs flukers we discovered too that we had missed two letters mr halsey had written us which of course is a great disappointment one written to both the other a short note of ten pages for me which i am sure was worth reading it was not until after sunset that we exhausted all topics of conversation and mr halsey took his leave promising to see us in the morning and to be sure as soon as i was dressed on saturday he again made his appearance followed soon after by the carriage taking a cordial leave of mrs cate with many thanks for her hospitality we entered our conveyance and with mr halsey riding by the side of the carriage went on our way he was to accompany us only as far as ponchatoula some six miles but the turningpoint in his journey seemed to be an undetermined spot for mile after mile rolled away rather the wheels rolled over them and still he rode by us talking through the window and the sprays of wild flowers he would pick for me from time to time were growing to quite a bouquet when he proposed an exchange with the farmer who was driving us and giving him his horse took the reins himself i think miriam and i will always remember that ride the laughter the conversation the songs with the murmuring accompaniment of the wheels and a thousand incidents pleasant to remember though foolish to speak of will always form a delightful tableau in our recollections i have but one disagreeable impression to remember in connection with the trip and that occurred at a farmhouse two miles from here where we stopped to get strawberries i preferred remaining in the carriage to the trouble of getting out so all went in mr halsey dividing his time equally between miriam in the house and me in the carriage supplying me with violets and penses one moment and the next showing me the most tempting strawberries at the most provoking distance assuring me they were exquisite the individual to whom the carriage belonged who had given up the reins to mr halsey and who no doubt was respectable enough for his class in his part of the country would allow no one to bring me my strawberries reserving the honor for himself presently he appeared with a large saucer of them covered with cream i was naturally thankful but would have preferred his returning to the house after he had fulfilled his mission instead he had the audacity to express his admiration of my personal appearance without a pause gave me a short sketch of his history informed me he was a widower and very anxious to marry again and finally lares and penates of the house of morgan ap kerrig veil your affronted brows you will scarcely credit that the creature had the insolence to say that he would marry me tomorrow if he could and think himself blessed for the jewel of the soul must be equal to the casket that contained it yes this brute of a man had the unparalleled audacity to speak to me in such a way just then mother remembering her invalid came to the gallery and asked how i was enjoying my lunch im courting her cried the wretch glad she did not go in swear shes the prettiest girl i ever saw at that moment mr halsey came sauntering out with a handful of violets for me and turning my shoulder to the creature i entered into a lively discussion with him and at last had the satisfaction of seeing the wretch enter the house a drive through the straggling halfdeserted town brought us here to mrs greysons a large oldfashionedlooking house so close to the tchefuncta i think that is the name of the river that i could throw a stone in it from my bed almost mrs greyson herself would require two or three pages to do her justice fancy the daughter of sir francis searle the widow of general greyson the belle of new orleans in her young days settled down into a hotelkeeper on a small scale with stately ladies and gentlemen looking down in solemn surprise at her boarders from their rich portrait frames on the parlor wall fallen greatness always gives me an uncomfortable thrill yet here was the heiress of these shadows on the wall gay talkative bustling active with a word of caution or a word of advice to all polite attentive agreeable to her guests quarreling and exacting with her servants grasping and avaricious with all singing a piece from norma in a voice about the size of a thread no 150 that showed traces of former excellence or cheapening a bushel of corn meal with equal volubility what a character full of little secrets and mysteries now my dear i dont ask you to tell a story you know but if the others ask you if you knew it just look surprised and say oh dear me when did it happen cause i promised not to tell only you are such favorites that i could not help it and it would not do to acknowledge it and if any one asks you if i put these candles in here just say you brought them with you thats a love because they will be jealous as i only allow them lamps eccentric mrs greyson many an hours amusement did she afford me a ride of twentysix miles bolt upright in the carriage over such bad roads had almost used me up i retired to bed in a state of collapse leaving miriam to entertain mr halsey alone after supper though i managed to put on my prettiest dress and be carried down to the parlor where i rejoined the rest several strange ladies were present one of whom has since afforded me a hearty laugh she was a horridlooking woman and ten minutes after i entered crossing the room with a most laughable look of vulgarity attempting to ape righteous scorn jerked some articles of personal property from the table and retired with the sweep of a small hurricane i thought her an eccentric female but what was my amazement yesterday to hear that she sought mrs greyson told her it was impossible for her to stay among so many elegantly dressed ladies and that she preferred keeping her room next day she told her that she was entirely too attentive to us and rather than be neglected in that way for other people would leave the house which she did instantly there was a singular assembly of odd characters in the parlor saturday night six of whom looked as though they were but so many reflections of the same individual in different glasses and the seventh differed from the rest only in playing exquisitely on the banjo too well to be a gentleman i fear these were soldiers come to call on us half an hour after we arrived a dozen of them took possession of the bench on the bank of the river one with his banjo who played and sang delightfully old mrs greyson who is rather eccentric called ah mr j have you heard already of the arrival of the young ladies you never serenaded me the young man naturally looked foolish so she went out and asked him to come around after dark and play for the young ladies so after a while he came bringing six devils yet worse than himself as the old scriptural phrase has it all of whom sat on the same side of the room and looked at us steadily when they thought we were not looking all had the same voice the same bow the same manner that is to say none at all of the latter one introduced an agreeable variety saying as he bowed to each separately happy to make your acquaintance maam mr halsey just managed to keep his face straight while i longed for a dickens to put them all together and make one amusing picture out of the seven i troubled myself very little about them preferring mr halseys company not knowing when we would meet again it would not have been quite fair to leave him to himself after he had ridden such a distance for us so i generously left the seven to miriam content with one and rather think i had the best of the bargain the one with the banjo suggested that we should sing for them before he played for us so miriam played on the piano and sang with me on the guitar half a dozen songs and then the other commenced i dont know when i have been more amused there was an odd pineywoods dash about him that was exceedingly diverting and he went through comic sentimental and original songs with an air that showed his whole heart was in it judging from the number of youth too timid to venture in who peeped at us from the windows i should say that young ladies are curiosities just now in madisonville ah another delightful glimpse of society has been offered to our charmed view such a treat has not often fallen to our lot good mrs greyson in her anxiety to make all around her happy determined we should have a dance i should say miriam for mrs bull and mrs ivy never indulge in such amusements and i cant so it must have been for miriam alone such a crew the two ladies above mentioned and i almost laughed ourselves into hysterics poor miriam with a tall slender texan who looked as though he had chopped wood all his life moved through the dance like the lady in comus only now and then a burst of laughter at the odd mistakes threatened to overcome her dignity we who were fortunately exempt from the ordeal laughed unrestrainedly at the mle one danced entirely with his arms his feet had very little to do with the time one hopped through with a most dolorous expression of intense absorption in the arduous task another never changed a benign smile that had appeared on entering but preserved it unimpaired through every accident one female apparently of the tender age of thirty wore a yellow muslin with her hair combed rigidly la chinoise and tightly fastened at the back of her head in a knot whose circumference must have been fully equal to that of a dollar in addition to other charms she bore her neck and chin in a very peculiar manner as though she were looking over the fence mr christmas remarked mr christmas had ridden all the way from ponchatoula to see us and if it had not been for him mr worthington and dr capdevielle who came in after a while i think i should have expired and even miriam would have given up in despair the doctor was an old friend of harrys though we never met him before mr halsey brought us each a little tortoiseshell ring he had made for us by his campfire as a keepsake and of course we promised to wear them for him particularly as they make our hands look as white as possible towards sunset in spite of prayers and entreaties from miriam who insisted that i was too feeble to attempt it i insisted on walking out to the bench by the river to enjoy the cool breeze and was rather glad i had come when soon after dr capdevielle made his appearance with two beautiful bouquets which he presented with his french bow to us and introducing his friend mr miltonberger entered into one of those lively discussions about nothing which frenchmen know how to make so interesting no sooner had they left than to our infinite surprise the immortal seven of saturday night walked in wonder what fun they find in coming i see none for we rarely trouble ourselves about their presence there are but two i have addressed as yet one because i am forced to say yes or no to his remarks and the other because i like his banjo which he brought again and feel obliged to talk occasionally since he is so accommodating and affords me the greatest amusement with his comic songs i was about retiring unceremoniously about twelve oclock completely worn out when they finally bethought themselves of saying goodnight and saved me the necessity of being rude wonder if that is all the fun they have i should say it was rather dry it is mean to laugh at them though their obliging dispositions should save them from our ridicule last evening mr halsey succeeded in procuring a large skiff whereupon four or five of them offered to row and took us way down the tchefuncta through the most charming scenery to a spot where echo answered us in the most remarkable way her distinct utterance was really charming not being aware of the secret i thought the first answer to the halloo was from pickets mr halsey has a magnificent voice and the echoes came back so full and rich that soon we appointed him speaker by mutual consent and were more than repaid by the delightful sounds that came from the woods the last ray of the sun on the smooth waters the soldiers resting on their oars while we tuned the guitar and sang in the still evening until twilight slowly closing over warned us to return forms another of those pictures indescribable though never to be forgotten when i paused on thursday to rest a few moments how little idea i had that the rest i was taking would soon be required for another journey it was agreed among us with our fellow travelers mrs bull and mrs ivy whom we met at mrs greysons endeavoring to reach the city like ourselves that we would wait there until we could receive our passports from general pemberton when this journey was first seriously contemplated miriam wrote to colonel szymanski representing mothers state of health and my unfortunate condition the necessity of medical advice for both and the impossibility of remaining in famishing clinton and asked him to apply to the general for a pass to go to brother the colonel sent word through eugene la noue that we should obtain it in a few days and advised us to go by way of ponchatoula tired of delay and hearing that we could pass as readily on general gardiners order we obtained one and started off without waiting for the other the first news on arriving at madisonville was that no one should pass except on general pembertons order pleasant intelligence for those who had come that far without the other two ladies were in the same dilemma they were told that they should have a pass if they would wait waiting at the expense of four dollars a day for each mrs ivy with two very sick babies mrs bull with all her property in new orleans at stake tiche with her broken foot mother with a powerless hand and i with an injured spine was anything but agreeable under the circumstances though nothing could be more pleasant apart from this sense of restriction than our stay at madisonville general pemberton took his leisure about the affair which is not surprising as our generals have more weighty matters than womens passports to attend to still pleased as we were with our residence there it was necessary to get on as soon as possible so as i rested from labors about one oclock on thursday mrs bull came in to suggest a new plan to mother it was to leave immediately for a plantation called bonfouca thirty miles off where schooners came twice a week and where we would be allowed to embark without a pass carriages that had just brought a party of ladies from mandeville were waiting on the other side of the river which could take us off immediately for there was not a moment to lose instantly we resolved to hazard the undertaking about three we got into the large scow to cross the tchefuncta in a party numbering five ladies four children and four servants one of the devoted pickets after setting me carefully in the most comfortable place asked permission to accompany me as far as the carriage he was sure he could assist me more carefully than the drivers and without further parley he followed before we turned the point mr worthington the dim distance rowing up the stream in the direction of madisonville what if he had perceived us and was hastening after us deeming it his duty to arrest us for trying to get away without general pembertons order as the idea was suggested there was rather a nervous set of ladies on board the halfmile that we had to go before reaching our landingplace was passed over in nervous apprehension at last the spot was reached mr worthington had not appeared and we reached terra firma without being nabbed as we confidently expected the obliging picket put me into the carriage bade me a most friendly adieu and returned to the village leaving us with every prospect of getting off without serious difficulty in spite of our serious apprehensions with two little children and tiche with me our carriage started off some time before the others two or three miles from our startingpoint i perceived three gentlemen riding towards us one of whom i instantly recognized as dr capdevielle instantly i stopped the carriage to speak to him his look of astonishment when satisfied of my identity rather amused me but my amusement was changed to a slight feeling of disappointment when he commenced talking was it possible i was leaving madison oh how distressed he was he was promising himself so much pleasure and to leave so unexpectedly he had just come with his friends from somewhere they had planned a surprise party at mrs greysons for us that evening and had been after the supper they had procured somewhere as i before observed and were just now returning and now we were deserting them he had invited monsieur berger monsieur pollock monsieur mais enfin des messieurs he exclaimed with a comical emphasis and smile that brought vivid recollections of the other party before my eyes by force of contrast i suppose and was nt i sorry we had left we fairly condoled with each other twenty minutes had elapsed before i had so far recovered from the disappointment as to bethink myself of the propriety of continuing my journey and then with the assurance of being mutually dsol we parted with a hearty goodbye and he rode on to rejoin his companions while i went the way he had come two miles beyond i met three others of the six gentlemen he had mentioned riding in a little dogcart which contained champagne baskets in which the supper was evidently packed each gentleman elegantly dressed holding between them a little basket of bouquets that my prophetic soul told me was intended for miriam and me i was not personally acquainted with the gentlemen or i should have told them of the disappointment that awaited them it must have been a disappointment in the midst of profound reflections about fate vanity of human wishes and calculations friendships formed on the roadside in the journey through life or from clinton i raised my eyes to behold lake ponchartrain and to find myself in mandeville just seven miles from the tchefuncta looking at the dreary expanse of water which suggested loneliness and desolation first recalled my own situation to me here i was in this straggling place with tiche a cripple like myself and two little children under my care without an idea of where we were to go any one as timid and dependent as i to be placed in such a position as pioneer to such a tremendous company would feel rather forlorn but some step had to be taken so i consulted the driver as to where we could obtain board and followed his suggestion one house after the other we stopped at and with my veil down and my heart beating as though i were soliciting charity or some other unpleasant favor i tried to engage rooms for the company without success at last we were directed to a frenchman who after the usual assurance of nothing to eat which we afterwards found to be only too true consented to receive us taking possession seemed to me such a dreadful responsibility that for some time i remained in the carriage afraid to get out before the others arrived but there was still no sign of them so i gathered my children and tiche and prepared to dismount with the frenchmans assistance i have read descriptions of such houses and people but i have not often seen them the man and his wife were perfect specimens of the low canadian speaking only french no sooner had they discovered that i was blesse as they supposed than each seized an arm and with overwhelming exclamations of sympathy halfway dragged me into the room where they thrust me into a chair their family seemed to consist only of cats and dogs who seemed to agree most harmoniously and each of whom conceived the liveliest affection for us as we were leaving mrs greysons a stranger just from the city brought to our room a paper of ham tongue and biscuits for the sick young lady heaven only knows how she heard of her saying she had just traveled the road herself and knew i would find nothing to eat so she would insist on putting this in our basket it was done in a manner that put all refusal out of the question so it had to be accepted i was feeding little jenny ivy and minna bull on this lunch for want of something else to do when the affection of the cats and dogs became overpowering six of them jumped at us licked jennys face eat minnas ham and what with sundry kicks and slaps i had exercise enough to last a week and was rapidly losing all my strength when the woman came to my rescue and called her pets off just as the rest of the party drove up to find me almost exhausted such a bedroom there was a narrow single bed in which mother jenny and i slept a decrepit table on which stood a diseased mirror a broken lounge without a bottom and a pine armoir filled with corn in the centre stood the chief ornament a huge pile of dirt near which miriams mattress was placed while the sail of a boat flanked it in on the other side arranged as a bed for tiche the accommodations in the other bedroom were far inferior to ours then the mosquitoes swarmed like pandemonium on a spree and there was but one bar in the house which the man declared should be only for me i would rather have been devoured by the insects than enjoy comforts denied to the others so i made up my mind it should be the last time our supper was rare nothing like it was ever seen in paris as mcclellan would say it consisted of one egg apiece with a small spoonful of rice a feast you see price one dollar each besides the dollar paid for the privilege of sleeping among dirt dogs and fleas friday morning we arose and prepared to resume our journey for bonfouca twentythree miles away the man walked in very unceremoniously to get corn from the armoir as we got up throwing open the windows and performing sundry little offices usually reserved for femmesdechambre but with that exception everything went on very well breakfast being a luxury not to be procured we got into the carriages before sunrise and left this romantic abode of dogs and contentment again our road lay through piney woods so much like that from hammond to ponchatoula that involuntarily i found myself looking through the window to see if mr halsey was there it lacked only his presence to make the scene all in all the same but alas this time the driver picked me wild flowers and brought us haws mr halsey in blissful ignorance of our departure was many and many a mile away the drive was not half as amusing the horse would not suffer any one except miriam to drive and at last refused to move until the driver got down and ran along by the carriage every time the poor boy attempted to occupy his seat the obstinate animal would come to a dead stop and refuse to go until he dismounted again i am sure that he walked nineteen miles out of the twentythree out of complaisance to the ungrateful brute all equally fatigued and warm we reached this place about twelve oclock mrs bull had arrived before us and as the carriage stopped her girl delia came to the gate the personification of despair crying you cant get out ladies they say we cant stop here we must go right back the panic which ensued is indescribable go back when we were almost at our journeys end after all the money we had spent the fatigue we had undergone to be turned back all the way to clinton perhaps with my sick babies cried mrs ivy with my sick child cried mother never you may turn me out of your house but we will die in the woods first to go back is to kill my daughter and these babies this was to the overseer who came to the carriage madam i have orders to allow no one to pass who has not written permission lieutenant worthington sent the order two days ago and i am liable to imprisonment if i harbor those who have no passport the man explained but we have general gardiners order i expostulated then you shall certainly pass but these ladies cannot i cant turn you away though you shall all come in and stay until something can be determined on this much granted was an unlookedfor blessing he showed us the way to a large unfurnished house one room of which contained a bed with one naked mattress which was to be our apartment mrs bull sat down in a calm dignified state of despair little mrs ivy dissolved in tears we all felt equally disconsolate the prospect of getting off was not so pleasant when we thought we should be obliged to leave them behind our common misfortunes had endeared us to each other strangers as we were a week ago so we all lamented together a perfect jrmiade of despair the overseer is very tenderhearted he condoled comforted and finally determined that if there was any way of getting them off they should go a glimpse of sunshine returned to our lowering sky and cheerfulness reigned once more to be violently dethroned some hours later three of the madisonville pickets were announced approaching the house of course they were coming after us oh that vile mr worthington we always did hate him there was such a sneaky look about him hypocrite we always felt we should hate him oh the wretch i wont go back cried mother i shall not said quiet mrs bull he shall pay my expenses if he insists on taking me back exclaimed mrs ivy spent all my money mrs bull you have none to lend me remember and mrs morgan shant oh that worthington let s make him pay for all we smothered our laughter to sit trembling within as the pickets stepped on the gallery i believe we commenced praying just think thus far our journey has cost mother two hundred and twenty dollars it would cost the same to get back to blessed clinton and fancy our spending that sum to settle there again besides we gave away all our clothes to our suffering friends and what would we do there now after half an hour of painful suspense we discovered that it would have been as well to spare poor mr worthington for the pickets were not after us but had come to escort mrs r a woman who was taking the body of her son who was killed at murfreesboro to the city for interment poor woman she rode all this distance sitting on her childs coffin her husband was one of those who with b stole that large sum of money from father which came so near ruining him she speaks of her husband as of a departed saint i dare say she believes him innocent of the theft in spite of his public confession the grave has wiped out even the disgrace of the penitentiary where he expiated his offense when i told tiche who the woman was she clasped her hands saying the lord is good years and years master suffered while she grew rich and now her time comes the lord dont forget i cant feel that way it is well for the narrowminded to look for gods judgment on us for our sins but mine is a more liberal faith god afflicted her for some wise purpose but if i thought it was to avenge father i should be afraid of her as it is i can be sorry oh so sorry for her as usual i find myself taken care of at the expense of the others there are but two bars on the place one the overseer said should be for me the other for the children sheets were scarce covers scarcer still tired of being spoiled in this way i insisted on being allowed to sleep on a mattress on the floor after a vigorous skirmish with mother and miriam in which i came off victorious for a bar i impressed miriams grenadine dress which she fastened to the doorknob and let fall over me la victoria tester arrangement to my share fell a double blanket which as tiche had no cover i unfolded and as she used the foot of my bed for a pillow gave her the other end of it thus tell it not in yankeeland for it will never be credited actually sleeping under the same bedclothes with our black shiny negro nurse we are grateful though even for these discomforts it might have been so much worse indeed i fear that our fellow travelers do not fare as well those who have sheets have no bars those who have blankets have no sheets and one woman who has recently joined us has nothing except a mattress which is to do the duty of all three but then we got bread real pure wheat bread and coffee none of your potato burnt sugar and parched corn abomination but the unadulterated berry i cant enjoy it fully though every mouthful is cloyed with the recollection that lilly and her children have none as usual as mrs greyson says the flowers follow us yesterday i received three bouquets and miriam got one too in this outoftheway place such offerings are unexpected and these were doubly gratifying coming from people one is not accustomed to receiving them from for instance the first was from the overseer the second from a servant and the third from a poor boy for whom we have subscribed to pay his passage to the city yesterday we arrived i thought we should never get here monday we had almost given up in despair believing the schooner would never return but in the evening when all were gathered in our room discussing our hopes and fears a sail was perceived at the mouth of the bayou whereupon every one rushed out to see the boat land i believe that i have not mentioned that this bonfouca is on a bayou of the same name that runs within a few yards of this house it is an indian name signifying winding river which struck us as very appropriate when we watched the schooner sailing now to the left now to the right apparently through the green fields for the high grass hid the course of the stream so that the faintest line was not perceptible except just in front of the house all was now bustle and confusion packing dressing and writing last words to our friends at home until halfpast eleven when we embarked this is my first experience of schooners and i dont care if i never behold another the cabin where mr kennedy immediately carried me was just the size of my bed at home in the days i had a home and just high enough to stand in on each side of the short ladder there was a mattress two feet wide one of them mrs r had possession of already the other was reserved for me i gave the lower part of mine to minna and jennie who spent the rest of the night fighting each other and kicking me just before twelve we weighed anchor and i went on deck to take a last look at dixie with the rest of the party every heart was full each left brothers sisters husband children or dear friends behind we sang farewell dear land with a slight quaver in our voices looked at the beautiful starlight shining on the last boundary of our glorious land and fervently and silently praying passed out of sight god bless you all you dear ones we have left in our beloved country god bless and prosper you and grant you the victory in the name of jesus christ i returned to my mattress and this is the way we spent the night mrs r rocking and moaning as she sat up in bed whined out her various ills with a minute description of each ceasing the recital only to talk of her sons body which lay on deck yesterday morning she was sitting crying on his coffin while a strange woman sat on its head eating her bread and cheese mrs bull one of the most intelligent and refined ladies i have yet met who is perfectly devoted to me sat by me laughing and talking trying her best to make every one comfortable and happy in her unobtrusive way mother talked to mrs r and cried at the thought of leaving her children fighting and suffering the space between the two beds was occupied by three irishwomen and mrs ivys two babies the babies had commenced screaming as they were brought into the pen at which i was not surprised having pitched their voices on the proper key they never ceased shrieking kicking crying throwing up and going through the whole list of baby performances the nurses scolded with shrill voices above the bedlam that had hushed even mrs rs complaints jennie and minna quarreled kicked and cried and as an aggravation to the previous discomforts a broadshouldered perspiring irishwoman sat just by my head bracing herself against my pillow in the most unpleasant style i endured it without flinching until about halfpast three when the condensed odor of a dozen different people and children became unendurable and i staggered up on deck where miriam and mrs ivy had been wise enough to remain without venturing below they laid me on a bench in the stern rolled me up in shawls to keep off the heavy dew and there i remained until daylight with them as wide awake as ever at daylight there was a universal smoothing of heads and straightening of dresses besides arrangements made for the inspection of baggage being unwilling for any christian to see such a book as this i passed a piece of tape through the centre leaves and made miriam tie it under her hoops at sunrise we were in sight of the houses at the lake end it seemed as though we would never reach land i forgot to speak of our alarm as we got in the lake no sooner had we fairly left the bayou than the sky suddenly became threatening the captain shook his head and spoke of a very ugly night for the lake which sent everybodys heart to their throats and alarmed us immeasurably we got talking of the sailors superstition of crossing the water with a corpse until we persuaded ourselves that it was more than probable we would founder in the coming storm but the severest storm we met was the one in the cabin and all night the only wind was a head breeze and the spicy gale from below when we at last entered the canal i beheld the animal now so long unseen the yankee in their dark blue uniforms they stood around but i thought of the dear gray coats and even the pickets of madisonville seemed nobler and greater men than these immediately a guard was placed on board we whispering before he came our dear confederates god bless them we had agreed among ourselves that come what would we would preserve our dignity and selfrespect and do anything rather than create a scene among such people it is well that we agreed so we whispered quietly among ourselves exhorting each other to pay no attention to the remarks the yankees made about us as we passed and acting the martyr to perfection until we came to hickocks landing here there was a group of twenty yankees two officers came up and asked us for papers we said we had none in five minutes one came back and asked if we had taken the oath no we had never taken any he then took down our names mother was alone in the coop he asked if there was not another the schooner had fifteen passengers and we had given only fourteen names mother then came up and gave her name going back soon after while one went after our passes others came to examine our baggage i could not but smile as an unfortunate young man got on his knees before our trunk and respectfully handled our dirty petticoats and stockings you have gone through it before he said of course the confederates searched it indeed they did not touch it i exclaimed they never think of doing such work miss it is more mortifying to me than it can be to you he answered and i saw he was actually blushing he did his work as delicately as possible and when he returned the keys asked if we had letters i opened my box and put them into his hand one came near getting me into serious trouble it was sent by some one i never saw with the assurance that it contained nothing objectionable i gave it sealed to the man who opened it when it proved to be rather disagreeable i judged from his language he told me his captain must see it before he could let me have it and carried it off presently he came back and told me it could not be returned i told him to burn it then as i neither knew the writer the contents nor those it was written to i may save you some difficulty if i destroy it he remarked whereupon he tore it up and flung it into the canal i have since found i had cause to be grateful for just after came an officer to see the young lady who brought that letter i showed the pieces in the water saying the young man had torn it up which seemed to annoy him it was to be sent to headquarters he said then came a bundle of papers on board carried by another who standing in front of us cried in a startling way sarah morgan here very quietly stand up i cannot firmly why not unable decisively after this brief dialogue he went on with the others until all were standing except myself when he delivered to each a strip of paper that informed the people that miss or mrs soandso had taken and subscribed the oath as citizen of the united states i thought that was all and rejoiced at our escape but after another pause he uncovered his head and told us to hold up our right hands halfcrying i covered my face with mine and prayed breathlessly for the boys and the confederacy so that i heard not a word he was saying until the question so help you god struck my ear i shuddered and prayed harder there came an awful pause in which not a lip was moved each felt as though in a nightmare until throwing down his blank book the officer pronounced it all right strange to say i experienced no change i prayed as hard as ever for the boys and our country and felt no nasty or disagreeable feeling which would have announced the process of turning yankee then it was that mother commenced he turned to the mouth of the diminutive cave and asked if she was ready to take the oath i suppose i have to since i belong to you she replied no madam you are not obliged we force no one can you state your objections yes i have three sons fighting against you and you have robbed me beggard me she exclaimed launching into a speech in which heaven knows what she did not say there was little she left out from her despoiled house to her sore hand both of which she attributed to the at first amiable man who was rapidly losing all patience faint with hunger dizzy with sleeplessness she had wrought on her own feelings until her nerves were beyond control she was determined to carry it out and crying and sobbing went through with it i neither spoke nor moved the officer walked off angrily and sent for a guard to have mother taken before general bowens once through her speech mother yielded to the entreaties of the ladies and professed herself ready to take the oath since she was obliged to madam i did not invite you to come said the polite officer who refused to administer the oath and putting several soldiers on board ordered them to keep all on board until one could report to general bowens mother retired to the cabin while we still kept our seats above oh that monotonous neverending canal we thought it would go on forever at last we came to the basin in the centre of the city here was a position for ladies sitting like irish emigrants on their earthly possessions and coming in a schooner to new orleans which a year ago would have filled us with horror again the landing was reached and again we were boarded by officers i dont know how they knew of the difficulty mother had made but they certainly did and ordered that none should leave until the generals will was made known mrs bull and mrs ivy after a long delay and many representations at last prepared to leave i was sitting in the spot i had occupied ever since before daylight with nothing to support me above my hips all of us had fasted since an early and light supper the night before none had slept i was growing so weak from these three causes and the burning sun for it was now twelve that i could hardly speak when they came to tell me goodbye alarmed at my appearance mrs bull entreated the officer to allow me to leave the boat no he said it was impossible we should remain on board until general bowens could come we may get an answer in half an hour or we may not get it for some time and there we must stay until it came but this young lady has been ill for months she is perfectly exhausted and will faint if she is not removed immediately pleaded mrs bull she did not know my powers of control faint i would have expired silently first the officer said those were his orders i could not leave do you think you are performing your duty as a gentleman and a christian this young lady has obtained her pass already without the slightest difficulty she persisted still he said he was acting according to orders not to be baffled she begged that she might be allowed to take me to brother telling him who he was while our trunk miriam tiche and mother would remain as hostages then he gave a reluctant consent on condition i left my number so he could go after me when i was wanted i dont know what good came of the consent for there i was to remain until something i dont know what happened i only know i was growing deathly sick and faint and could hardly hold myself up when some time after mrs bull and mrs ivy left under the impression that i was to go immediately a gentleman in citizens clothes came to me and said he had obtained permission for me to wait general bowens orders in his office a few steps from the schooner thankful for so much i accepted his arm and slowly dragged myself along to the first shelter i had seen that day by some wonderful condescension miriam and mother were allowed to follow and with the guard at the door we waited there for half an hour more until our sentence could be received miriam had written a line to brother as soon as possible telling him of the situation and while we were waiting in this office i half dead with fatigue a carriage dashed up to the door and out of it stepped brother i felt that all our troubles were over then he looked so glad to see us that it seemed a pity to tell the disagreeable story that yet remained to be told but once heard he made all go right in a few moments he got into the carriage with mother to take her to general bowens while we got into another to come to the house i saw no more of the guard or officer when we arrived sister was too astonished to speak she did not believe we would come when it was ordered that all should take the oath on entering if we had only realized it i dont think we would either in half an hour mother got back supported by brothers presence she had managed to hold up her right hand and say yes to the oath which was more than any of us had done brother found and officer at the door who had been ordered before he took mother to the general to arrest her and confine her in the customhouse i suppose miriam and i would have shared the imprisonment with her but brother has a way of making all these things right and the man was sent back without accomplishing his mission i am getting well bless the lord o my soul life health and happiness dawn on my trembling view again dr stone came to see me a few hours after i arrived two days after he called again this morning i walked out to meet him when he was announced and he asked me how my sister was when i told him i was myself god bless my soul you dont say so he exclaimed evidently astonished at the resurrection was not the recollection of this day bitter enough to me already i did not think it could be more so yet behold me crying as i have not cried for many and many a day not for harry i dare not cry for him i feel a deathlike quiet when i think of him a fear that even a deepdrawn breath would wake him in his grave and as dearly as i love you o hal i dont want you in this dreary world again talk of the revocation of the edict of nantes talk of louis xiv of pshaw my head is in such a whirl that history gets all mixed up and all parallels seem weak and moderate in comparison to this infamous outrage today thousands of families from the most respectable down to the least all who have had the firmness to register themselves enemies to the united states are ordered to leave the city before the fifteenth of may think of the thousands perfectly destitute who can hardly afford to buy their daily bread even here sent to the confederacy where it is neither to be earned nor bought without money friends or a home hundreds have comfortable homes here which will be confiscated to enrich those who drive them out it is an ill wind that blows no one good such dismal faces as one meets everywhere each looks heartbroken homeless friendless beggars is written in every eye brothers face is too unhappy to make it pleasant to look at him true he is safe but hundreds of his friends are going forth destitute leaving happy homes behind not knowing where the crust of bread for famishing children is to come from tomorrow he went to general bowens and asked if it were possible that women and children were included in the order yes he said they should all go and go in the confederacy they should not be allowed to go elsewhere penned up like sheep to starve thats the idea with the addition of forty thousand mouths to feed they think they can invoke famine to their aid seeing that their negro brothers dont help them much in the task of subjugating us dont care who knows i smuggled in a dozen letters wish i had had more my dear brother who is always seeking to make somebody happy arranged a dinnerparty at the lake for us saturday there was quite a number of us as besides ourselves and the five children we had mrs price and her children mrs bull and three nurses there are no southern young men left in town and those who remain would hardly be received with civility by miriam and myself of the yankees brother has so much consideration for us that he has never invited one to his house since we have been here though he has many friends among them who visited here before our arrival such delicacy of feeling we fully appreciate knowing how very few men of such a hospitable nature would be capable of such a sacrifice thinking we need company brother frequently invites what he calls a safe old secessionist an old bachelor of fiftythree who was wounded at shiloh to dine with us thinking it a fair compromise between the stayathome youth and the yankees neither of whom this extremely young man could be confounded with the excitement about port hudson and vicksburg is intense when i heard on friday that the last attack was being made on the former place i took to my prayers with a delirium of fervor if i was a man if i had the blessed privilege of fighting i would be on the breastworks or perchance on the water batteries under colonel steadmans command but as i was unfortunately born a woman i stay home and pray with heart and soul that is all i can do but i do it with a will in my excitement i was wishing that i was a catholic that i might make a vow for the preservation of port hudson when a brilliant idea struck me it was this though vows are peculiar to catholics mosquitoes are common to all sects from that arose this heroic scheme i said hear me miriam thou who knowest i have slept undisturbed but three nights out of seventeen four hours out of each of the other fourteen having been spent in destroying my insatiable foe thou seest that nightly vigils are torturing me pale and weak thou knowest what unspeakable affection i have for the youth yclept by the ancients morpheus yet listen to my vow if port hudson holds out if our dear people are victorious i offer up myself on the altar of my country to mosquitoes and never again will i murmur at their depredations and voracity talk of pilgrimages and the ordinary vow of wearing only the virgins colors the most becoming in the world there never was one of greater heroism or more sublime selfsacrifice than this and as if to prove my sincerity they have been worse than ever these last two nights but as yet i have not murmured for the yankees who swore to enter port hudson before last monday night have not yet fulfilled their promise and we hold it still vivent vows and mosquitoes and forever may our flag wave over the entrenchments we will conquer yet with gods blessing a week or ten days ago came a letter from lydia who is placed within the lines by this recent raid she writes that the sugarhouse and quarters have been seized for yankee hospitals that they have been robbed of their clothing and that they are in pursuit of the general who i pray heaven may escape them she wrote for clothing provisions and a servant and after we had procured them all and were ready to send them we discovered that they would not be allowed to pass so i hardly know what the poor child will do unless she accepts brothers invitation to come down to him immediately if she thinks it right i must write something somewhere i dont care if dinner is ready and brothers safe old secesh downstairs lydia has another boy letter has just come and i am demented about my new godchild there now feel better one more word it shall be called howell dear blessed little baby how i shall love it how about that oath of allegiance is what i frequently ask myself and always an uneasy qualm of conscience troubles me guilty or not guilty of perjury according to the law of god in the abstract and of nations yes according to my conscience jeff davis and the peculiar position i was placed in no which is it had i had any idea that such a pledge would be exacted would i have been willing to come never the thought would have horrified me the reality was never placed before me until we reached bonfouca there i was terrified at the prospect but seeing how impossible it would be to go back i placed all my hopes in some miracle that was to intervene to prevent such a crime and confidently believed my ill health or something else would save me while all the rest of the party declared they would think it nothing and take forty oaths a day if necessary a forced oath all men agree is not binding the yankees lay particular stress on this being voluntary and insist that no one is solicited to take it except of their own free will yet look at the scene that followed when mother showed herself unwilling think of being ordered to the customhouse as a prisoner for saying she supposed she would have to thats liberty that is free will it is entirely optional you have only to take it quietly or go to jail that is freedom enough certainly there was not even that choice left to me i told the officer who took down my name that i was unwilling to take the oath and asked if there was no escaping it none whatever was his reply you have it to do and there is no getting out of it his rude tone frightened me into halfcrying but for all that as he said i had it to do if perjury it is which will god punish me who was unwilling to commit the crime or the man who forced me to it o praise the lord o my soul here is good news enough to make me happy for a month brother is so good about that every time he hears good news on our side he tells it just as though it was on his side instead of on ours while all bad news for us he carefully avoids mentioning unless we question him so today he brought in a budget for us lee has crossed the potomac on his way to washington with one hundred and sixty thousand men gibbes and george are with him magruder is marching on fort jackson to attack it in the rear one or two of our english ironclads are reported at the mouth of the river and farragut has gone down to capture them o jimmy jimmy suppose he should be on one of them we dont know the name of his ship and it makes us so anxious for him during these months that we have heard nothing of his whereabouts it is so delightful to see these frightened yankees one has only to walk downtown to be satisfied of the alarm that reigns yesterday came the tidings of the capture of brashere city by our troops and that a brigade was fifteen miles above here coming down to the city men congregated at corners whispering cautiously these were evidently confederates who had taken the oath solitary yankees straggled along with the most lugubrious faces troubling no one we walked down to blineaus with mrs price and over our icecream she introduced her husband who is a true blue union man though she like ourselves is a rank rebel mr price on the eve of making an immense fortune was perfectly disconsolate at the news every one was to be ruined starvation would follow if the confederates entered there was never a more dismal unhappy creature enchanted at the news i naturally asked if it were reliable perfectly why to prove how true standing at the door of this salon five minutes ago i saw two young ladies pass with confederate flags which they flirted in the face of some federal officers unrebuked verily thought i something is about to happen two days ago the girls who were unrebuked this evening would have found themselves in jail instead shall i cry faint scream or go off in hysterics tell me which quickly for to doubt this news is fine and imprisonment and if i really believe it i would certainly give way to my feelings and commit some vagaries of the kind my resolution is formed i will do neither i wont gratify the yankees so much i have been banging at the piano until my fingers are weary and singing the secret through life to be happy until my voice is cracked ill stand on my head if necessary to prove my indifference but ill never believe this is true until it is confirmed by stronger authority day before yesterday came tidings that vicksburg had fallen on the 4th inst the era poured out extras and sundry little popguns fizzled out salutes all who doubted the truth of the report and were brave enough to say so were fined or imprisoned it has become a penal offense to doubt what the era says so quite a number of arrests were made this morning it was followed up by the announcement of the capture of port hudson the guns are pealing for true and the yankees at headquarters may be seen skipping like lambs for very joy and i still disbelieve skeptic the first thing i know that era man will be coming here to convert me but i dont cant wont believe it if it is true but i find consolation in this faith it is either true or not true if it is true it is all for the best and if it is not true it is better still whichever it is is for some wise purpose so it does not matter so we wait pray and believe i dont believe it what am i crying about then it seems so hard how the mighty are fallen port hudson gone brother believes it that is enough for me god bless him i cry hourly he is so good and considerate he told me name your friends and what can be done for them shall be attended to the prisoners will be sent here maybe i cannot do much but food and clothing you shall have in abundance for them when they arrive god bless him for his kindness o dear noble men i am afraid to meet them i should do something foolish best take my cry out in private now may the lord look down in pity on us port hudson does not matter so much but these brave noble creatures the era says they had devoured their last mule before they surrendered i preach patience but how about practice i am exasperated there is the simple fact and is it not enough what a scene i have just witnessed a motley crew of thousands of low people of all colors parading the streets with flags torches music and all other accompaniments shouting screaming exulting over the fall of port hudson and vicksburg the era will call it an enthusiastic demonstration of the loyal citizens of the city we who saw it from upper balconies know of what rank these citizens were we saw crowds of soldiers mixed up with the lowest rabble in the town workingmen in dirty clothes newsboys ragged children negroes and even women walking in the procession while swarms of negroes and low white women elbowed each other in a dense mass on the pavement to see such creatures exulting over our misfortune was enough to make one scream with rage one of their dozen transparencies was inscribed with a dead confederacy fools the flames are smouldering they will burst out presently and consume you more than half much more were negroes as they passed by here they raised a yell of down with the rebels that made us gnash our teeth in silence the devil possessed me o miriam help me pray the dear lord that their flag may burn i whispered as the torches danced around it and we did pray earnestly so earnestly that miriams eyes were tightly screwed up but it must have been a wicked prayer for it was not answered dr s has out a magnificent display of black cotton grammatically inscribed with port hudson and vicksburg is ours garnished with a luminous row of tapers and drunk on two bits worth of lager beer he has been shrieking out all union songs he can think of with his horrid children until my tympanum is perfectly cracked miriam wants to offer him an extra bottle of lager for the two places of which he claims the monopoly he would sell his creed for less miriam is dying to ask him what he has done with the confederate uniform he sported before the yankees came his son says they are all union men over there and will lemonate illuminate tonight a starving seamstress opposite has stuck six tallow candles in her window better put them in her stomach and i wont believe vicksburg has surrendered port hudson i am sure has fallen alas for all hopes of serving the brave creatures the rumor is that they have been released on parole happily for them but if it must go what a blessed privilege it would have been to aid or comfort them it is but too true both have fallen all port hudson privates have been paroled and the officers sent here for exchange aye aye i know some privates i would rather see than the officers as yet only ten that we know have arrived all are confined in the customhouse last evening crowds surrounded the place we did something dreadful ada peirce miriam and i we went down to the confectionery and unable to resist the temptation made a dtour by the customhouse in hope of seeing one of our poor dear halfstarved mule and rat fed defenders the crowd had passed away then but what was our horror when we emerged from the river side of the building and turned into canal to find the whole front of the pavement lined with yankees our folly struck us so forcibly that we were almost paralyzed with fear however that did not prevent us from endeavoring to hurry past though i felt as though walking in a nightmare ada was brave enough to look up at a window where several of our prisoners were standing and kept urging us to do likewise look he knows you sarah he has called another to see you they both recognize you oh look please and tell me who they are they are watching you still she would exclaim but if my own dear brother stood there i could not have raised my eyes we only hurried on faster with a hundred yankees eyes foxed on our flying steps my friend colonel steadman was one of the commissioners for arranging the terms of the capitulation i see he has not yet arrived dreadful news has come of the defeat of lee at gettysburg think i believe it all he may have been defeated but no one of these reports of total overthrow and rout do i credit yankees jubilant southerners dismal brother with principles on one side and brothers on the other is correspondingly distracted it may be wrong i feel very contrite but still i cannot help thinking it is an error on the right side it began by miriam sending mr conn a box of cigars when she was on canal the other day with a note saying we would be delighted to assist him in any way poor creature he wrote an answer which breathed desolation and humility under his present situation in every line the cigars an unexpected kindness had touched a tender cord evidently he said he had no friends and would be grateful for our assistance but before his answer arrived yesterday morning i took it into my head that colonel steadman was also at the customhouse though his arrival had not been announced the yankees declining to publish any more names to avoid the excitement that follows so miriam and i prepared a lunch of chicken soup wine preserves sardines and cakes to send to him and foollike i sent a note with it it only contained the same offer of assistance and i would not object to the town criers reading it but it upset brothers ideas of decorum completely he said nothing to miriams because that was first offense but yesterday he met edmond who was carrying the basket and he could not stand the sight of another note i wish he had read it but he said he would not assume such a right so he came home very much annoyed and spoke to miriam about it fortunately for my peace of mind i was swimming in the bathtub in blissful unconsciousness else i should have drowned myself he said i want you both to understand that you shall have everything you want for the prisoners subscribe any sum of money purchase any quantity of clothing send all the food you please but for gods sake dont write to them in such a place every man knows the other has received a letter and none know what it contains i cannot have my sisters names in everybodys mouth never do it again all as kind and as considerate for us as ever and a necessary caution i love him the better for it but i was dismayed for having rendered the reproof necessary for three hours i made the most hideous faces at myself and groaned aloud over brothers displeasure he is so good that i would rather bite my tongue off than give him a moments pain just now i went to him unable to keep silence any longer and told him how distressed i was to have displeased him about that note dont think any more about it only dont do it again dear was his answer i was so grateful to him for his gentleness that i was almost hurried into a story i began it is the first time when i caught myself and said boldly no it is not colonel steadman has written to me before and i have replied but i promise to you it shall not occur again if i can avoid it he was satisfied with the acknowledgment and i was more than gratified with his kindness yet the error must have been on the right side colonel steadman wrote back his thanks by edmond with heartfelt gratitude for finding such friends in his adversity and touching acknowledgments of the acceptable nature of the lunch his brother and colonel lock were wounded though recovering and he was anxious to know if i had yet recovered and that was all except that he hoped we would come to see him and his thanks to brother for his kind message brother had sent him word by one of the prisoners that though he was not acquainted with him yet as his sisters friend he would be happy to assist him if he needed money or clothing there was no harm in either note and though i would not do it again i am almost glad i let him know he still had friends before brother asked me not to write and as yet we cant see them a man was bayoneted yesterday for waving to them even it only makes us the more eager to see them we did see some walking on rampart street with the peirces yesterday in front of a splendid private house we saw sentinels stationed upon inquiry we learned that general gardiner and a dozen others were confined there ada and miriam went wild if it had not been for dignified marie and that model of propriety sarah there is no knowing but what they would have carried the house by storm we got them by without seeing a gray coat when they vowed to pass back declaring that the street was not respectable on the block above we had to follow so there they all stood on the balcony above we thought we recognized general gardiner major wilson major spratley and mr dupr miriam was sure she did but even when i put on a bold face and tried to look something kept me from seeing so i had all the appearance of staring without deriving the slightest benefit from it wonder what makes me such a fool mr conn writes that captain bradford is wounded but does not say whether he is here it is bad policy to keep us from seeing the prisoners it just sets us wild about them put a creature you dont care for in the least in a situation that commands sympathy and nine out of ten girls will fall desperately in love here are brave selfsacrificing noble men who have fought heroically for us and have been forced to surrender by unpropitious fate confined in a city peopled by their friends and kindred and as totally isolated from them as though they inhabited the dry tortugas ladies are naturally heroworshipers we are dying to show these unfortunates that we are as proud of their bravery as though it had led to victory instead of defeat banks wills that they remain in privacy consequently our vivid imaginations are constantly occupied in depicting their sufferings privations heroism and manifold virtues until they have almost become as demigods to us even horrid little captain c has a share of my sympathy in his misfortune fancy what must be my feelings where those i consider as gentlemen are concerned it is all i can do to avoid a most tender compassion for a very few select ones miriam and i are looked on with envy by other young ladies because some twenty or thirty of our acquaintance have already arrived to know a port hudson defender is considered as the greatest distinction one need desire if they would only let us see the prisoners once to sympathize with and offer to assist them we would never care to call on them again until they are liberated but this is aggravating of what benefit is it to send them lunch after lunch when they seldom receive it colonel steadman and six others i am sure did not receive theirs on sunday we sent with the baskets a number of cravats and some handkerchiefs i had embroidered for the colonel brother should forbid those gentlemen writing too already a dozen notes have been received from them and what can we do we cant tell them not to miriam received a letter from major spratley this morning raving about the kindness of the ladies of new orleans full of hope of future successes and vows to help deliver the noble ladies from the hands of their oppressors etc it is a wonder that such a patriotic effusion could be smuggled out he kindly assures us that not only those of our acquaintance there but all their brother officers would be more than happy to see us in their prison position of affairs rather reversed since we last met doomed to be bored tonight miriam drags me to a soire musicale and in the midst of my toilet i sit down with bare shoulders to scratch a dozen lines in my new treasure which has been by me for three days untouched i dont know what tempts me to do it except perversity for i have nothing to say i was in hopes that i would never have occasion to refer to the disagreeable subject that occupied the last pages of my old journal but the hope proves fallacious and wherever i turn the same subject is renewed so there is no longer any reason in waiting until all mention can be avoided yesterday a little sly snaky creature asked me if i knew the hero of port hudson yes i said briefly unmistakable i see it in your face she remarked see what that you betray yourself do you know that every one believes that you are engaged to him in surprise i said no such a thing had never been mentioned before me until then well they say so and add too that you are to be married as soon as the war is over they are paying me an undeserved compliment i returned where could such a report have originated not certainly from him and not most assuredly from me where does dame rumor spring from he is a stranger here and i have never mentioned his name except to the peirces who would no more report such a thing than i would myself i wont mind it if it does not reach his ears but what assurance have i that it will not that would be unpleasant why cant they say let everybody settle their own affairs here comes miriam after me what a bore what a bore and she looks as though it was a pleasure to go out how i hate it glancing up the page the date strikes my eye what tempted me to begin it friday my dear ada would shiver and declare the blank pages were reserved for some very painful awful uncomfortable record or that something would happen before the end of it nothing very exciting can happen except the restoration of peace and to bring that about i would make a vow to write only on fridays coming out of church this morning with miriam a young lady ran up with an important air as though about to create a sensation i have a message for you both she said fixing her eyes on mine as though she sought something in them i visit the prisoners frequently you know and day before yesterday captain steadman requested me to beg you to call that he will not take a refusal but entreated you to come if it were only once the fates must be against me i had almost forgotten his existence and having received the same message frequently from another i thoughtlessly said you mean colonel do you not fortunately miriam asked the same question at the instant that i was beginning to believe i had done something very foolish the lady looked at me with her calm scrutinizing disagreeable smile a smile that had all the unpleasant insinuations eyes and lips can convey a smile that looked like i have your secret you cant deceive me and said with her piercing gaze no not the colonel he was very ill that day did you know it and could not see us this was really the captain he is very kind i stammered and suggested to miriam that we had better pass on the lady was still eyeing me inquisitively decidedly this is unpleasant to have the reputation of being engaged to a man that every girl is crazy to win if one only cared for him it would not be so unpleasant but under the circumstances ah a why dont they make him over to the young lady whose father openly avows he would be charmed to have him for a soninlaw this report has cost me more than one impertinent stare the young ladies think it a very enviable position let some of them usurp it then so the young lady not having finished her examination proposed to accompany us part of the way as a recompense we were regaled with charming little anecdotes about herself and her visits how she had sent a delightful little custard to the colonel here was a side glance at my demure face and had carried an autographic album in her last visit and had insisted on their inscribing their names and writing a verse or so how interesting was my mental comment can a man respect a woman who thrusts him her album begging for a compliment the first time they meet what fools they must think us if they take such as these for specimens of the genus did we know captain lanier know him no but how vividly his face comes before me when i look back to that grand smashup at port hudson when his face was the last i saw before being thrown and the first i recognized when i roused myself from my stupor and found myself in the arms of the young alabamian at the sound of his name i fairly saw the last ray of sunset flashing over his handsome face as i saw it then no i did not know him he had spoken to me begging to be allowed to hold me and i had answered entreating him not to touch me and that was all i knew of him but she did not wait for the reply she hurried on to say that she had sent him a bouquet with a piece of poetry and that he had been heard to exclaim how beautiful on reading it and do you know she continued with an air that was meant to be charmingly naf but which was not very successful as navet at twentynine is rather flat i am so much afraid he thinks it original i forgot to put quotation marks and it would be so funny in him to make the mistake for you know i have not much of the of that sort of thing about me i am not a poet poetess author you know said miriam in her blandest tone without a touch of sarcasm in her voice oh if he has ever seen you the mistake is natural if i had spoken my voice would have carried a sting in it so i waited until i could calmly say you know him well of course no i never saw him before she answered with a new outburst of navet a letter from captain bradford to miriam my poor adonis that i used to ridicule so unmercifully what misfortunes have befallen him he writes that during the siege at port hudson he had the top of his ear shot off wonder if he lost any of that beautiful golden fleece yclept his hair and had the cap of his knee removed by a shell besides a third wound he does not specify fortunately he is with kind friends and he gives news of lydia most acceptable since such a time has elapsed since we heard from her he says tell miss sarah that the last i saw of john he was crossing the mississippi in a skiff his parole in his pocket his sweet little sister by his side o you wretch at it again and somebody else in his heart how considerate to volunteer the last statement then followed half a page of commendation for his bravery daring and skill during the siege the only kind word he ever spoke of him i dare say all looking as though i was to take it as an especial compliment to myself and was expected to look foolish blush and say thanky for it as though i care i consider myself outrageously imposed upon i am so indignant that i have spent a whole evening making faces at myself please miss sarah look natural william petitions i never saw you look cross before good reason i never had more cause however i stop in the midst of a hideous grimace and join in a game of hide the switch with the children to forget my annoyance of course a woman is at the bottom of it last night while ada and marie were here a young lady whose name i decline to reveal for the sake of the sex stopped at the door with an english officer and asked to see me in the entry i had met her once before remember this for that is the chief cause of my anger of course they were invited in but she declined saying she had but a moment and had a message to deliver to me alone so led me apart of course you know who it is from she began i told a deliberate falsehood and said no though i guessed instantly she told me the name then she had visited the prison the day before and there had met the individual whose name joined to mine has given me more trouble and annoyance during the last few months than it would be possible to mention and our entire conversation was about you she said as though to flatter my vanity immensely he told her then that he had written repeatedly to me without receiving an answer and at last had written again in which he had used some expressions which he feared had offended my reserved disposition something had made me angry for without returning letter or message to say i was not displeased i had maintained a resolute silence which had given him more pain and uneasiness than he could say that during all this time he had had no opportunity of explaining it to me and that now he begged her to tell me that he would not offend me for worlds that he admired me more than any one he had ever met that he could not help saying what he did but was distressed at offending me etc the longest explanation and she was directed to beg me to explain my silence and let him know if i was really offended and also leave no entreaty or argument untried to induce me to visit the prison he must see me as to visiting the prison i told her that was impossible o how glad i am that i never did but as to the letters told her to assure him that i had not thought of them in that light and had passed over the expressions he referred to as idle words it would be ridiculous to take offense at and that my only reason for persevering in this silence had been that brother disapproved of my writing to gentlemen and i had promised that i would not write to him that i had feared he would misconstrue my silence and had wished to explain it to him but i had no means of doing so except by breaking my promise and so had preferred leaving all explanation to time and some future opportunity but you did not mean to pain him did you the dear little creature coaxingly lisped standing on tiptoe to kiss me as she spoke i assured her that i had not he has been dangerously ill she continued apologizingly and sickness has made him more morbid and more unhappy about it than he would otherwise have been it has distressed him a great deal i felt awkwardly how was it that this girl meeting him for the first and only time in her life had contrived to learn so much that she had no right to know and appeared here as mediator between two who were strangers to her so far usurping a place she was not entitled to as to apologize to me for his sensitiveness and to entreat me to tell him he had not forfeited my esteem as though she was his most intimate friend and i a passing acquaintance failing to comprehend it i deferred it to a leisure moment to think over and in the mean time exerted myself to be affable i cant say half she spoke of but as she was going she said then will you give me permission to say as many sweet things for you as i can think of im going there tomorrow i told her i would be afraid to give her carte blanche on such a subject but that she would really oblige me by explaining about the letters she promised and after another kiss and a few whispered words left me maybe she exaggerated though uncharitable as the supposition was it was a consolation i was unwilling to believe that any one who professed to esteem me would make me the subject of conversation with a stranger and such a conversation so my comfort was only in hoping that she had related a combination of truth and fiction and that he had not been guilty of such folly presently it grew clearer to me i must be growing in wickedness to fathom that of others i who so short a time ago disbelieved in the very existence of such a thing i remembered having heard that the young lady and her family were extremely anxious to form his acquaintance and that her cousin had coolly informed ada that she had selected him among all others and meant to have him for a beau as soon as she could be introduced to him i remembered that the young lady herself had been very anxious to discover whether the reputation common report had given me had any foundation as soon as we were alone i told mother of our conversation in the entry and said and now i am certain that this girl has made use of my name to become acquainted with him o my prophetic soul part of your forebodings are already verified and in what an unpleasant way day before yesterday an english officer not the one who came here but one totally unknown to me said at mrs peirces he was going to visit the confederate prisoners he was asked if he knew any slightly he said but he was going this time by request he had any quantity of messages to deliver to colonel from miss sarah morgan how can that be possible since you are not acquainted with her ada demanded he had the impudence to say that the young lady i have already mentioned had requested him to deliver them for her since she found it impossible fortunately for me i have two friends left feeling the indelicacy of the thing and knowing that there must be some mistake that might lead to unpleasant consequences ada and marie my good angels insisted on hearing the messages at first he refused saying that they were entrusted to him confidentially but being assured that they were really intimate with me whereas the other was a perfect stranger and that i would certainly not object to their hearing what i could tell a gentleman he yielded fortunately for my peace of mind and told all i cant repeat it i was too horrified to hear all when they told me what struck me as being most shocking was my distorted explanation about the letters it now set forth that i was not allowed to write myself but would be happy to have him write to me then there was an earnest assurance that my feelings toward him had not changed in the least here i sprang from my chair and rushed to the window for a breath of air wringing my hands in speechless distress how a word more or less an idea omitted or added a syllable misplaced can transform a whole sentence and make what was before harmless really shocking and if it had not been for ada and marie blessed angels they entreated him not to deliver any of his messages insisting that there must be a mistake that if he knew me he would understand that it was impossible for me to have sent such a message by a stranger and although at first he declared he felt obliged to discharge the task imposed on him they finally succeeded in persuading him to relinquish the errand promising to be responsible for the consequences ah me i gasped last night making frantic grimaces in the dark and pinching myself in disgust why cant they let me alone o women women i wish he could marry all of you so you would let me alone take him please but en grce dont disgrace me in the excitement of the race write me down a witch a prophetess or what you will i am certainly something all has come to pass on that very disagreeable subject very much as i feared perhaps no one in my position would speak freely on the subject for that very reason i shall not hesitate to discuss it know then that this morning he went north along with many other confederate prisoners to be exchanged and he left he who has written so incessantly and so imploringly for me to visit his prison he left without seeing me bon wonder what happened i have learned more he has not yet left part of the mystery is unraveled only i have neither patience nor desire to seek for more these women hush to slander is too much like them be yourself my sweet little lisper informed a select circle of friends the other night when questioned that the individual had not called on me and what was more would not do so pray how do you happen to be so intimately acquainted with the affairs of two who are strangers to you asked a lady present she declined saying how she had obtained her information only asserting that it was so in fact you cannot expect any confederate gentleman to call at the house of judge morgan a professed unionist she continued so that is the story she told to keep him from seeing me she has told him that we had turned yankees all her arts would not grieve me as much as one word against brother my wrongs i can forget but one word of contempt for brother i never forgive white with passion i said to my informant will you inform the young lady that her visit will never be returned that she is requested not to repeat hers and that i decline knowing any one who dares cast the slightest reflection on the name of one who has been both father and brother to me this evening i was at a house where she was announced miriam and i bade our hostess goodevening and left without speaking to her anybody but brother no one shall utter his name before me save with respect and regard this young womans father is a captain in the yankee navy and her brother is a captain in the yankee army while three other brothers are in the confederate like herself i have three brothers fighting for the south unlike her the only brother who avows himself a unionist has too much regard for his family to take up arms against his own flesh and blood i hope this will be the last occasion on which i shall refer to the topic to which this unfortunate book seems to have been devoted but it gives me a grim pleasure to add a link to the broken chain of the curious story now and then maybe some day the missing links will be supplied me and then i can read the little humdrum romance of what might have been or what i m glad never was as easily as marie tells her rosary well the prisoners have gone at last to my unspeakable satisfaction day before yesterday they left now i can go out as i please without fear of meeting him face to face how odd that i should feel like a culprit but that is in accordance with my usual judgment and consistency friday i had a severe fright coming up camp street with ada after a ramble on canal we met two confederates everywhere that morning we had met gray coats but none that i recognized still without looking i saw through my eyelids as it were two hands timidly touch two gray caps as though the question may i had not yet been answered in vain i endeavored to meet their eyes or give the faintest token of greeting i was too frightened and embarrassed to speak and only by a desperate effort succeeded in bending my head in a doubtful bow that would have disgraced a dairy maid after we had passed then disgusted with myself i endeavored to be comforted with the idea that they had perhaps mistaken me for some one else that having known me at a time when i was unable to walk they could have no idea of my height and figure or walk so i reasoned turning down a side street lo at a respectable distance they were following we had occasion to go into a daguerreau salon while standing in the light two gray uniforms watching us from the dark recess at the door attracted my attention pointing them out to ada i hurried her past them downstairs to the street faster and faster we walked until at the corner i turned to look there they were again sauntering leisurely along we turned into another street mingled in the crowd and finally lost sight of them that fright lasted me an hour or two whose purse have i stolen that i am afraid to look these men in the face but what has this to do with what i meant to tell how loosely and disconnectedly my ideas run out with the ink from my pen i meant to say how sorry i am for my dear little lisper that she failed in her efforts to conquer the hero and here i have drifted off in a page of trash that does not concern her in the least well she did not succeed and whatever she told him was told in vain as far as she was concerned he was not to be caught what an extraordinary man dozens fighting for the preference and he in real or pretended ignorance i must do him the justice to say he is the most guileless as well as the most honest of mortals he told the mother of a rich and pretty daughter what he thought of me that my superior did not exist on earth and my equal he had never met ha ha this pathetic story makes me laugh in spite of myself is it excess of innocence or just a rle he adopted stop his idle word is as good as an oath he could not pretend to what he did not believe he told her of his earnest and sincere admiration words words hurry on she asked how it was then here he confessed with a mixture of pride and penitence that he had written me letters which absolutely required answers and to which i had never deigned to reply by even a word that mortified beyond measure at my silent contempt he had tried every means of ascertaining the cause of my coldness but i had never vouchsafed an answer but had left him to feel the full force of my harsh treatment without one word of explanation that when he was paroled he had hoped that i would see him to tell him wherein he had forfeited my esteem but i had not invited him to call and mortified and repulsed as he had been it was impossible for him to call without my permission did my little lisper change the message when the little midshipman told her it had been intercepted because too friendly i know she met this martyred lion frequently after that and had many opportunities of telling him the simple truth but she evidently did not he has gone away with sorely wounded feelings to say nothing more for that i am sincerely sorry but i trust to his newly acquired freedom and his life of danger and excitement to make him forget the wrongs he believes himself to have suffered at my hands if it was all to be gone through again which thank heaven i will never be called upon to endure again i would follow brothers advice as implicitly then as i did before he is right and without seeing i believe they tell me of his altered looks and of his forced reckless gaiety which so strangely out of keeping with his natural character but makes his assumed part more conspicuous no matter he will recover nothing like a sea voyage for disorders of all kinds and we will never meet again that is another consolation notice the public are hereby informed through mrs chief manager of the theatre of high tragedy that miss sarah m having been proved unworthy and incompetent to play the rle of ariadne said part will hereafter be filled by miss blank of blank street who plays it with a fidelity so true to nature that she could hardly be surpassed by the original another odd link of the old stale story has come to me all the way from new york a friend of mine who went on the same boat with the prisoners wrote to her mother to tell her that she had formed the acquaintance of the most charming fascinating gentleman among them no other than my once friend of course she would have been less than a woman if she had not gossiped when she discovered who he was so she sends me word that he told her he had been made to believe as long as he was on parole in new orleans that we were all unionists now and that brother would not allow a confederate to enter the house o my little lisper was i unjust to you he told her that i had been very kind to him when he was in prison and he would have forgotten the rest and gladly have called to thank me in person for the kindness he so gratefully remembered if i alone had been concerned but he felt he could not force himself unasked into my brothers house she told him how false it was a report has just reached us that my poor dear gibbes has been taken prisoner along with the rest of hayess brigade yes it is so if his own handwriting is any proof mr appleton has just sent brother a letter he had received from gibbes asking him to let brother know he was a prisoner and we have heard through some one else that he had been sent to sandusky brother has applied to have him paroled and sent here or even imprisoned here if he cannot be paroled our distress about gibbes has been somewhat relieved by good news from jimmy the jolliest sailor letter from him came this morning dated only the 4th instant from cherbourg detailing his cruise on the georgia from leaving england to bahia trinidad cape of good hope to france again such a bright dashing letter we laughed extravagantly over it when he told how they readily evaded the vanderbilt knowing she would knock them into pie how he and the french captain quarreled when he ordered him to show his papers and how he did not know french abuse enough to enter into competition with him so went back a first and second time to maury when the man would not let him come aboard whereupon maury brought the ship to with two or three shots and jimmy made a third attempt and forced the frenchman to show his papers he tells it in such a matteroffact way no extravagance no idea of having been in a dangerous situation he a boy of eighteen on a french ship in spite of the captains rage what a jolly life it must be now dashing in storms and danger now floating in sunshine and fun wish i was a midshipman then how he changes in describing the prize with an assorted cargo that they took which contained all things from a needle to pianos from the reckless spurt in which he speaks of the plundering to where he tells of how the captain having died several days before was brought on the georgia while maury read the service over the body and consigned it to the deep by the flames of the dead mans own vessel what noble tender manly hearts it shows those rough seamen stopping in their work of destruction to perform the last rites over their dead enemy one can fancy their bare heads and sunburned faces standing in solemn silence around the poor dead man when he dropped into his immense grave god bless the pirates the last of eighteen sixtythree is passing away as i write every new year since i was in my teens i have sought a quiet spot where i could whisper to myself tennysons death of the old year and even this bitter cold night i steal into my freezing tireless little room en robe de nuit to keep up my old habit while the others sleep old year you shall not die we did so laugh and cry with you ive half a mind to die with you old year if you must die no go and welcome bring peace and brighter days o dawning new year die faster and faster old one i count your remaining moments with almost savage glee last night we were thrown into the most violent state of commotion by the unexpected entrance of captain bradford he has been brought here a prisoner from asphodel where he has been ever since the surrender of port hudson and taking advantage of his triweekly parole his first visit was naturally here as he has no other friends poor creature how he must have suffered the first glance at his altered face where suffering and passion have both left their traces unmistakably since we last met and the mere sight of his poor lame leg filled my heart with compassion how he hates mr halsey i could not forego the pleasure of provoking him into a discussion about him knowing how they hated each other he would not say anything against him understand that as a gentleman and a companion mr halsey was his warmest and best friend there was no one he admired more but he must say that as a soldier he was the worst he had ever seen not that he was not as brave and gallant a man as ever lived but he neglected his duties most shamefully while visiting linwood so constantly eluding the sentinels daily as he asked for neither pass nor permission and consulting only his inclinations instead of his superior officers or his business and that last night at linwood when he absented himself without leave why could he not have signified to him his captain that he wished to say goodbye instead of quietly doing as he pleased when the colonel sent for a report of the number of men quantity of forage and ammunition etc and it was discovered that john halsey was absent without leave with the books locked up and the keys in his pocket even after this lapse of time the fire flashed through the ice as the captain spoke sergeant halsey i am sorry for you when you reported yourself next day all the fun that could have been crowded into an evening at linwood could not have repaid you for the mornings scene and after all what was it beyond very empty pleasure with a great deal of laughter he could have dispensed with it just as well looking back i congratulate myself on being the only one who did not ask him to stay not dead not dead o my god gibbes is not dead where o dear god another only a few days ago came a letter so cheerful and hopeful we have waited and prayed so patiently at my feet lies one from colonel steadman saying he is dead dead suddenly and without a moments warning summoned to god no it cannot be i am mad o god have mercy on us my poor mother and lydia lydia god comfort you my brain seems afire am i mad not yet god would not take him yet he will come again hush god is good not dead not dead o gibbes come back to us o god o god have mercy on us george is dead both in a week george our sole hope our sole dependence dead dead both dead o my brothers what have we lived for except you we who would have so gladly laid down our lives for yours are left desolate to mourn over all we loved and hoped for weak and helpless while you so strong noble and brave have gone before us without a murmur god knows best but it is hard o so hard to give them up if we had had any warning or preparation this would not have been so unspeakably awful but to shut ones eyes to all dangers and risks and drown every rising fear with god will send them back i will not doubt his mercy and then suddenly to learn that your faith has been presumption and god wills that you shall undergo bitter affliction it is a fearful awakening what glory have we ever rendered to god that we should expect him to be so merciful to us are not all things his and is not he infinitely more tender and compassionate than we deserve we have deceived ourselves wilfully about both after the first dismay on hearing of gibbess capture we readily listened to the assertions of our friends that johnsons island was the healthiest place in the world that he would be better off comfortably clothed and under shelter than exposed to shot and shell half fed and lying on the bare ground during ewells winter campaign we were thankful for his safety knowing brother would leave nothing undone that could add to his comfort and besides that there was the sure hope of his having him paroled on that hope we lived all winter now confident that in a little while he would be with us then again doubting for a while only to have the hope grow surer afterwards and so we waited and prayed never doubting he would come at last he himself believed it though striving not to be too hopeful lest he should disappoint us as well as himself yet he wrote cheerfully and bravely to the last towards the middle of january brother was sure of succeeding as all the prisoners had been placed under butlers control ah me how could we be so blind we were sure he would be with us in a few weeks i wrote to him that i had prepared his room on the 30th of january came his last letter addressed to me though meant for lavinia it was dated the 12th the day george died all his letters pleaded that i would write more frequently he loved to hear from me so i had been writing to him every ten days on the 3d of february i sent my last friday the 5th as i was running through miriams room i saw brother pass the door and heard him ask miriam for mother the voice the bowed head the look of utter despair on his face struck through me like a knife gibbes gibbes was my sole thought but miriam and i stood motionless looking at each other without a word gibbes is dead said mother as he stood before her he did not speak and then we went in we did not ask how or when that he was dead was enough for us but after a while he told us uncle james had written that he had died at two oclock on thursday the 21st still we did not know how he had died several letters that had been brought remained unopened on the floor one brother opened hoping to learn something more it was from colonel steadman to miriam and me written a few hours after his death and contained the sad story of our dear brothers last hours he had been in colonel steadmans ward of the hospital for more than a week with headache and sore throat but it was thought nothing he seemed to improve and expected to be discharged in a few days on the 21st he complained that his throat pained him again after prescribing for him and talking cheerfully with him for some time colonel steadman left him surrounded by his friends to attend to his other patients he had hardly reached his room when some one ran to him saying captain morgan was dying he hurried to his bedside and found him dead captain steadman sick in the next bed and those around him said he had been talking pleasantly with them when he sat up to reach his cup of water on the table as soon as he drank it he seemed to suffocate and after tossing his arms wildly in the air and making several fearful efforts to breathe he died hush mother hush i said when i heard her cries we have brother and george and jimmy left and lydia has lost all heaven pity us george had gone before only he in mercy kept the knowledge of it from us for a while longer on thursday the 11th as we sat talking to mother striving to make her forget the weary days we had cried through with that fearful sound of dead dead ringing ever in our ears some one asked for miriam she went down and presently i heard her thanking somebody for a letter you could not have brought me anything more acceptable it is from my sister though she can hardly have heard from us yet i ran back and sitting at mothers feet told her miriam was coming with a letter from lydia mother cried at the mention of her name o my little sister you know how dear you are to us mother mother a horrible voice cried and before i could think who it was miriam rushed in holding an open letter in her hand and perfectly wild george is dead she shrieked and fell heavily to the ground o my god i could have prayed thee to take mother too when i looked at her i thought i almost hoped she was dead and that pang spared but i was wild myself i could have screamed laughed it is false do you hear me mother god would not take both george is not dead i cried trying in vain to arouse her from her horrible state or bring one ray of reason to her eye i spoke to a body alive only to pain not a sound of my voice seemed to reach her only fearful moans showed she was yet alive miriam lay raving on the ground poor miriam her hearts idol torn away god help my darling i did not understand that george could die until i looked at her in vain i strove to raise her from the ground or check her wild shrieks for death george only george she would cry until at last with the horror of seeing both die before me i mastered strength enough to go for the servant and bid her run quickly for brother how long i stood there alone i never knew i remember ada coming in hurriedly and asking what it was i told her george was dead it was a relief to see her cry i could not but i felt the pain afresh as though it were her brother she was crying over not mine and the sight of her tears brought mine too we could only cry over mother and miriam we could not rouse them we did not know what to do some one called me in the entry i went not understanding what i was doing a lady came to me told me her name and said something about george but i could not follow what she said it was as though she was talking in a dream i believe she repeated the words several times for at last she shook me and said listen rouse yourself the letter is about george yes i said he is dead she said i must read the letter but i could not see so she read it aloud it was from dr mitchell his friend who was with him when he died telling of his sickness and death he died on tuesday the 11th of january after an illness of six days conscious to the last and awaiting the end as only a christian and one who has led so beautiful a life could with the grace of god look for it he sent messages to his brothers and sisters and bade them tell his mother his last thoughts were of her and that he died trusting in the mercy of the saviour george our pride our beautiful angel brother could he die surely god has sent all these afflictions within these three years to teach us that our hopes must be placed above and that it is blasphemy to have earthly idols the letter said that the physicians had mistaken his malady which was inflammation of the bowels and he had died from being treated for something else it seemed horrible cruelty to read me that part i knew that if mother or miriam ever heard of it it would kill them so i begged mrs mitchell never to let them hear of it she seemed to think nothing of the pain it would inflict how could she help telling if they asked she said i told her i must insist on her not mentioning it it would only add suffering to what was already insupportable if they asked for the letter offer to read it aloud but say positively that she would not allow any one to touch it except herself and then she might pass it over in silence i roused miriam then and sent her to hear it read she insisted on reading it herself and half dead with grief held out her hands begging piteously to be suffered to read it alone i watched then until i was sure mrs mitchell would keep her promise horrible as i knew it to be from strange lips i knew by what i experienced that i had saved her from a shock that might cost her her life and then i went back to mother no need to conceal what i felt there she neither spoke nor saw if i had shrieked that he died of ill treatment she would not have understood but i sat there silently with that horrible secret wondering if god would help me bear it or if despair would deprive me of selfcontrol and force me presently to cry it aloud though it should kill them both at last brother came i had to meet him downstairs and tell him god spare me the sight of a strong mans grief then sister came in knowing as little as he poor sister i could have blessed her for every tear she shed it was a comfort to see some one who had life or feeling left i felt as though the whole world was dead nothing was real nothing existed except horrible speechless pain life was a fearful dream through which but one thought ran dead dead miriam had been taken to her room more dead than alive mother lay speechless in hers the shock of this second blow had obliterated with them all recollection of the first it was a mercy i envied them for i remembered both until loss of consciousness would have seemed a blessing i shall never forget mothers shriek of horror when towards evening she recalled it o those dreadful days of misery and wretchedness it seems almost sacrilege to refer to them now they are buried in our hearts with our boys thought of with prayers and tears how will the world seem to us now what will life be without the boys when this terrible strife is over and so many thousands return to their homes what will peace bring us of all we hoped jimmy dear lord spare us that one this morning we heard jimmy is engaged to helen trenholm daughter of the secretary of the confederate states he wrote asking brothers consent saying they had been engaged since august though he had had no opportunity of writing until that day the middle of september i cried myself blind it seems that our last one is gone but this is the first selfish burst of feeling later i shall come to my senses and love my sister that is to be but my darling my darling o jimmy how can i give you up you have been so close to me since harry died alone now best so one year ago in my little room in the camp street house i sat shivering over tennyson and my desk selfishly rejoicing over the departure of a year that had brought pain and discomfort only to me and eagerly welcoming the dawning of the new one whose first days were to bring death to george and gibbes and whose latter part was to separate me from miriam and brings me news of jimmys approaching marriage o sad dreary fearful old year i see you go with pain bitter as you have been how do we know what the coming one has in store for us what new changes will it bring which of us will it take i am afraid of eighteen sixtyfive and have felt a vague dread of it for several years past nothing remains as it was a few months ago miriam went to lilly in the confederacy on the 19th of october ah miriam and mother and i have been boarding with mrs postlethwaite ever since i miss her sadly not as much though as i would were i less engaged for since the first week in august i have been teaching the children for sister and since we have been here i go to them every morning instead of their coming to me starting out at halfpast eight daily and returning a little before three does not leave me much time for melancholy reflections and there is no necessity for indulging in them at present they only give pain all things are taken from us and become portions and parcels of the dreadful pasts thursday the 13th came the dreadful tidings of the surrender of lee and his army on the 9th everybody cried but i would not satisfied that god will still save us even though all should apparently be lost followed at intervals of two or three hours by the announcement of the capture of richmond selma mobile and johnstons army even the stanchest southerners were hopeless every one proclaimed peace and the only matter under consideration was whether jeff davis all politicians every man above the rank of captain in the army and above that of lieutenant in the navy should be hanged immediately or some graciously pardoned henry ward beecher humanely pleaded mercy for us supported by a small minority davis and all leading men must be executed the blood of the others would serve to irrigate the country under this lively prospect peace blessed peace was the cry i whispered never let a great earthquake swallow us up first let us leave our land and emigrate to any desert spot of the earth rather than return to the union even as it was six days this has lasted blessed with the silently obstinate disposition i would not dispute but felt my heart swell repeating god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in time of trouble and could not for an instant believe this could end in an overthrow this morning when i went down to breakfast at seven brother read the announcement of the assassination of lincoln and secretary seward vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord this is murder god have mercy on those who did it charlotte corday killed marat in his bath and is held up in history as one of libertys martyrs and one of the heroines of her country to me it is all murder let historians extol bloodshedding it is womans place to abhor it and because i know that they would have apotheosized any man who had crucified jeff davis i abhor this and call it foul murder unworthy of our cause and god grant it was only the temporary insanity of a desperate man that committed this crime let not his blood be visited on our nation lord across the way a large building undoubtedly inhabited by officers is being draped in black immense streamers of black and white hang from the balcony downtown i understand all shops are closed and all wrapped in mourning and i hardly dare pray god to bless us with the crape hanging over the way it would have been banners if our president had been killed though to see a whole city draped in mourning is certainly an imposing spectacle and becomes almost grand when it is considered as an expression of universal affliction so it is in one sense for the more violently secesh the inmates the more thankful they are for lincolns death the more profusely the houses are decked with the emblems of woe they all look to me like not sorry for him but dreadfully grieved to be forced to this demonstration so all things have indeed assumed a funereal aspect men who have hated lincoln with all their souls under terror of confiscation and imprisonment which they understand is the alternative tie black crape from every practicable knob and point to save their homes last evening the bs were all in tears preparing their mourning what sensibility what patriotism a stranger would have exclaimed but bellas first remark was is it not horrible this vile vile old crape think of hanging it out when tears of rage finished the sentence one would have thought pity for the murdered man had very little to do with it coming back in the cars i had a rencontre that makes me gnash my teeth yet it was after dark and i was the only lady in a car crowded with gentlemen i placed little miriam on my lap to make room for some of them when a great dark man all in black entered and took the seat and my left hand at the same instant saying goodevening miss sarah frightened beyond measure to recognize captain todd of the yankee army in my interlocutor i however preserved a quiet exterior and without the slightest demonstration answered as though replying to an internal question mr todd it is a long while since we met he ventured four years i returned mechanically you have been well my health has been bad i have been ill myself and determined to break the ice he diverged with baton rouge has changed sadly i hope i shall never see it again we have suffered too much to recall home with any pleasure i understand you have suffered severely he said glancing at my black dress we have yet one left in the army though i could not help saying he too had a brother there he said he pulled the checkstring as we reached the house adding this is it and absurdly correcting himself with where do you live 211 i thank you goodevening the last with emphasis as he prepared to follow he returned the salutation and i hurriedly regained the house monsieur stood over the way a look through the blinds showed him returning to his domicile several doors below i returned to my own painful reflections the mr todd who was my sweetheart when i was twelve and he twentyfour who was my brothers friend and daily at our home was put away from among our acquaintance at the beginning of the war this one i should not know cords of candy and mountains of bouquets bestowed in childish days will not make my countrys enemy my friend now that i am a woman while praying for the return of those who have fought so nobly for us how i have dreaded their first days at home since the boys died i have constantly thought of what pain it would bring to see their comrades return without them to see families reunited and know that ours never could be again save in heaven last saturday the 29th of april seven hundred and fifty paroled louisianians from lees army were brought here the sole survivors of ten regiments who left four years ago so full of hope and determination on the 29th of april 1861 george left new orleans with his regiment on the fourth anniversary of that day they came back but george and gibbes have long been lying in their graves our confederacy has gone with one crash the report of the pistol fired at lincoln reading this for the first time in all these many years i wish to bear record that god never failed me through stranger vicissitudes than i ever dared record whatever the anguish whatever the extremity in his own good time he ever delivered me so that i bless him today for all of lifes joys and sorrows for all he gave for all he has taken and i bear witness that it was all very good
