captain lee of the engineers a hero to his childthe family petshome from the mexican warthree years in baltimoresuperintendent of the west point military academylieutenantcolonel of second cavalrysupresses john brown raid at harpers ferrycommands the department of taxes the first vivid recollection i have of my father is his arrival at arlington after his return from the mexican war i can remember some events of which he seemed a part when we lived at fort hamilton new york about 1846 but they are more like dreams very indistinct and disconnectednaturally so for i was at that time about three years old but the day of his return to arlington after an absence of more than two years i have always remembered i had a frock or blouse of some light wash material probably cotton a blue ground dotted over with white diamond figures of this i was very proud and wanted to wear it on this important occasion eliza my mammy objecting we had a contest and i won clothed in this my very best and with my hair freshly curled in long golden ringlets i went down into the larger hall where the whole household was assembled eagerly greeting my father who had just arrived on horseback from washington having missed in some way the carriage which had been sent for him there was visiting us at this time mrs lippitt a friend of my mothers with her little boy armistead about my age and size also with long curls whether he wore as handsome a suit as mine i cannot remember but he and i were left together in the background feeling rather frightened and awed after a moments greeting to those surrounding him my father pushed through the crowd exclaiming where is my little boy he then took up in his arms and kissednot me his own child in his best frock with clean face and wellarranged curlsbut my little playmate armistead i remember nothing more of any circumstances connected with that time save that i was shocked and humiliated i have no doubt that he was at once informed of his mistake and made ample amends to me a letter from my father to his brother captain s s lee united states nave dated arlington june 30 1848 tells of his coming home here i am once again my dear smith perfectly surrounded by mary and her precious children who seem to devote themselves to staring at the furrows in my face and the white hairs in my head it is not surprising that i am hardly recognisable to some of the young eyes around me and perfectly unknown to the youngest but some of the older ones gaze with astonishment and wonder at me and seem at a loss to reconcile what they see and what was pictured in their imaginations i find them too much grown and all well and i have much cause for thankfulness and gratitude to that good god who has once more united us my next recollection of my father is in baltimore while we were on a visit to his sister mrs marshall the wife of judge marshall i remember being down on the wharves where my father had taken me to see the landing of a mustang pony which he had gotten for me in mexico and which had been shipped from vera cruz to baltimore in a sailing vessel i was all eyes for the pony and a very miserable sadlooking object he was from his long voyage cramped quarters and unavoidable lack of grooming he was rather a disappointment to me but i soon got over all that as i grew older and was able to ride and appreciate him he became the joy and pride of my life i was taught to ride on him by jim connally the faithful irish servant of my father who had been with him in mexico jim used to tell me in his quizzical way that he and santa anna the ponys name were the first men on the walls of chepultepec this pony was pure white five years old and about fourteen hands high for his inches he was as good a horse as i ever have seen while we lived in baltimore he and grace darling my fathers favourite mare were members of our family grace darling was a chestnut of fine size and of great power which he had bought in texas on his way out to mexico her owner having died on the march out she was with him during the entire campaign and was shot seven times at least as a little fellow i used to brag about that number of bullets being in her and since i could point out the scars of each one i presume it was so my father was very much attached to her and proud of her always petting her and talking to her in a loving way when he rode her or went to see her in her stall of her he wrote on his return home i only arrived yesterday after a long journey up the mississippi which route i was induced to take for the better accommodation of my horse as i wished to spare her as much annoyance and fatigue as possible she already having undergone so much suffering in my service i landed her at wheeling and left her to come over with jim santa anna was found lying cold and dead in the park at arlington one morning in the winter of 6061 grace darling was taken in the spring of 62 from the white house my brothers place on the pamunkey river where the mare had been sent for save keeping by some federal quartermaster when mcclellan occupied that place as his base of supplies during his attack on richmond when we lived in baltimore i was greatly struck one day by hearing two ladies who were visiting us saying everybody and everythinghis family his friends his horse and his dogloves colonel lee the dog referred to was a blackandtan terrier named spec very bright and intelligent and really a member of the family respected and beloved by ourselves and well known to all who knew us my father picked up his mother in the narrows while crossing from fort hamilton to the fortifications opposite on staten island she had doubtless fallen overboard from some passing vessel and had drifted out of sight before her absence had been discovered he rescued her and took her home where she was welcomed by his children an made much of she was a handsome little thing with cropped ears and a short tail my father named her dart she was a fine ratter and with the assistance of a maltese cat also a member of the family the many rats which infested the house and stables were driven away or destroyed she and the cat were fed out of the same plate but dart was not allowed to begin the meal until the cat had finished spec was born at fort hamilton and was the joy of us children our pet and companion my father would not allow his tail and ears to be cropped when he grew up he accompanied us everywhere and was in the habit of going into church with the family as some of the little ones allowed their devotions to be disturbed by specs presence my father determined to leave him at home on those occasions so the next sunday morning he was sent up to the front room of the second story after the family had left for church he contented himself for awhile looking out of the window which was open it being summer time presently impatience overcame his judgement and he jumped to the ground landed safely notwithstanding the distance joined the family just as they reached the church and went in with them as usual much to the joy of the children after that he was allowed to go to church whenever he wished my father was very fond of him and loved to talk to him and about him as if he were really one of us in a letter to my mother dated fort hamilton january 18 1846 when she and her children were on a visit to arlington he thus speaks of him i am very solitary and my only company is my dogs and cats but spec has become so jealous now that he will hardly let me look at the cats he seems to be afraid that i am going off from him and never lets me stir without him lies down in the office from eight to four without moving and turns himself before the fire as the side from it becomes cold i catch him sometimes sitting up looking at me so intently that i am for a moment startled in a letter from mexico written a year laterdecember 25 46 to my mother he says cant you cure poor spec cheer him uptake him to walk with you and tell the children to cheer him up in another letter from mexico to his eldest boy just after the capture of vera cruz he sends this message to spec tell him i wish he was here with me he would have been of great service in telling me when i was coming upon the mexicans when i was reconnoitering around vera cruz their dogs frequently told me by barking when i was approaching them too nearly when he returned to arlington from mexico spec was the first to recognise him and the extravagance of his demonstrations of delight left no doubt that he knew at once his kind master and loving friend though he had been absent three years sometime during our residence in baltimore spec disappeared and we never knew his fate from that early time i began to be impressed with my fathers character as compared with other men every member of the household respected revered and loved him as a matter of course but it began to dawn on me that every one else with whom i was thrown held him high in their regard at fortyfive years of age he was active strong and as handsome as he had ever been i never remember his being ill i presume he was indisposed at times but no impressions of that kind remain he was always bright and gay with us little folk romping playing and joking with us with the older children he was just as companionable and the have seen him join my elder brothers and their friends when they would try their powers at a high jump put up in our yard the two younger children he petted a great deal and our greatest treat was to get into his bed in the morning and lie close to him listening while he talked to us in his bright entertaining way this custom we kept up until i was ten years old and over although he was so joyous and familiar with us he was very firm on all proper occasions never indulged us in anything that was not good for us and exacted the most implicit obedience i always knew that it was impossible to disobey my father i felt it in me i never thought why but was perfectly sure when he gave an order that it had to be obeyed my mother i could sometimes circumvent and at times took liberties with her orders construing them to suit myself but exact obedience to every mandate of my father was part of my life and being at that time he was very fond of having his hands tickled and what was still more curious it pleased and delighted him to take off his slippers and place his feet in our laps in order to have them tickled often as little things after romping all day the enforced sitting would be too much for us and our drowsiness would soon show itself in continued nods then to arouse us he had a way of stirring us up with his footlaughing heartily at and with us he would often tell us the most delightful stories and then there was no nodding sometimes however our interest in his wonderful tales became so engrossing that we would forget to do our dutywhen he would declare no tickling no story when we were a little older our elder sister told us one winter the everdelightful lady of the lake of course she told it in prose and arranged it to suit our mental capacity our father was generally in his corner by the fire most probably with a foot in either the lap of myself or youngest sisterthe tickling going on brisklyand would come in at different points of the tale and repeat line after line of the poemmuch to our disapprovalbut to his great enjoyment in january 1849 captain lee was one of a board of army officers appointed to examine the coasts of florida and its defenses and to recommend locations for new fortifications in april he was assigned to the duty of the construction of fort carroll in the patapsco river below baltimore he was there i think for three years and lived in a house on madison street three doors above biddle i used to go down with him to the fort quite often we went to the wharf in a bus and there we were met by a boat with two oarsmen who rowed us down to sollers point where i was generally left under the care of the people who lived there while my father went over to the fort a short distance out in the river these days were happy ones for me the wharves the shipping the river the boat and oarsmen and the country dinner we had at the house at sollers point all made a strong impression on me but above all i remember my father his gentle loving care of me his bright talk his stories his maxims and teachings i was very proud of him and of the evident respect for and trust in him every one showed these impressions obtained at that time have never left me he was a great favourite in baltimore as he was everywhere especially with ladies and little children when he and my mother went out in the evening to some entertainment we were often allowed to sit up and see them off my father as i remember always in full uniform always ready and waiting for my mother who was generally late he would chide her gently in a playful way and with a bright smile he would then bid us goodbye and i would go to sleep with this beautiful picture in my mind the golden epaulets and allchiefly the epaulets in baltimore i went to my first school that of a mr rollins on mulberry street and i remember how interested my father was in my studies my failures and my little triumphs indeed he was so always as long as i was at school and college and i only wish that all of the kind sensible useful letters he wrote me had been preserved my memory as to the move from baltimore which occurred in 1852 is very dim i think the family went to arlington to remain until my father had arranged for our removal to the new home at west point my recollection of my father as superintendent of the west point military academy is much more distinct he lived in the house which is still occupied by the superintendent it was built of stone large and roomy with gardens stables and pasture lots we the two youngest children enjoyed it all grace darling and santa anna were there with us and many a fine ride did i have with my father in the afternoons when released from his office he would mount his old mare and with santa anna carrying me by his side take a five or tenmile trot though the pony cantered delightfully he would make me keep him in a trot saying playfully that the hammering sustained was good for me we rode the dragoonseat no posting and until i became accustomed to it i used to be very tired by the time i got back my father was the most punctual man i ever knew he was always ready for family prayers for meals and met every engagement social or business at the moment he expected all of us to be the same and taught us the use and necessity of forming such habits for the convenience of all concerned i never knew him late for sunday service at the post chapel he used to appear some minutes before the rest of us in uniform jokingly rallying my mother for being late and for forgetting something at the last moment when he could wait no longer for her he would say that he was off and would march along to church by himself or with any of the children who were ready there he sat very straightwell up the middle aisleand as i remember always became very sleepy and sometimes even took a little nap during the sermon at that time this drowsiness of my fathers was something awful to me inexplicable i know it was very hard for me to keep awake and frequently i did not but why he who to my mind could do everything right without any effort should sometimes be overcome i could not understand and did not try to do so it was against the rules that the cadets should go beyond certain limits without permission of course they did go sometimes and when caught were given quite a number of demerits my father was riding out one afternoon with me and while rounding a turn in the mountain road with a deep woody ravine on one side we came suddenly upon three cadets far beyond the limits they immediately leaped over a low wall on the side of the road and disappeared from our view we rode on for a minute in silence then my father said did you know those young men but no if you did dont say so i wish boys would do what was right it would be so much easier for all parties he knew he would have to report them but not being sure of who they were i presume he wished to give them the benefit of the doubt at any rate i never heard any more about it one of the three asked me the next day if my father had recognised them and i told him what had occurred by this time i had become old enough to have a room to myself and to encourage me in being useful and practical my father made me attend to it just as the cadets had to do with their quarters in barracks and in camp he at first even went through the form of inspecting it to see if i had performed my duty properly and i think i enjoyed this until the novelty wore off however i was kept at it becoming in time very proficient and the knowledge so acquired has been of great use to me all through life my father always encouraged me in every healthy outdoor exercise and sport he taught me to ride constantly giving me minute instructions with the reasons for them he gave me my first sled and sometimes used to come out where we boys were coasting to look on he gave me my first pair of skates and placed me in the care of a trustworthy person inquiring regularly how i progressed it was the same with swimming which he was very anxious i should learn in a proper manner professor bailey had a son about my age now himself a professor at brown university providence rhode island who became my great chum i took my first lesson in the water with him under the direction and supervision of his father my father inquired constantly how i was getting along and made me describe exactly my method and stroke explaining to me what he considered the best way to swim and the reasons therefor i went to dayschool at west point and had always a sympathetic helper in my father often he would come into the room where i studied at night and sitting down by me would show me how to overcome a hard sentence in my latin reader or a difficult sum in arithmetic not by giving me the translation of the troublesome sentence or the answer to the sum but by showing me step by step the way to the right solutions he was very patient very loving very good to me and i remember trying my best to please him in my studies when i was able to bring home a good report from my teacher he was greatly pleased and showed it in his eye and voice but he always insisted that i should get the maximum that he would never be perfectly satisfied with less that i did sometimes win it deservedly i know was due to his judicious and wise method of exciting my ambition and perseverance i have endeavoured to show how fond my father was of his children and as the best picture i can offer of his loving tender devotion to us all i give here a letter from him written about this time to one of his daughters who was staying with our grandmother mrs custis at arlington west point february 25 1853 my precious annie i take advantage of your gracious permission to write to you and there is no telling how far my feelings might carry men were i not limited by the conveyance furnished by the mims his pet name for my mother letter which lies before me and which must the mim says so go in this mornings mail but my limited time does not diminish my affection for you annie nor prevent my thinking of you and wishing for you i long to see you through the dilatory nights at dawn when i rise and all day my thoughts revert to you in expressions that you cannot hear or i repeat i hope you will always appear to me as you are now painted on my heart and that you will endeavor to improve and so conduct yourself as to make you happy and me joyful all our lives diligent and earnest attention to all your duties can only accomplish this i am told you are growing very tall and i hope very straight i do not know what the cadets will say if the superintendents children do not practice what he demands of them they will naturally say he had better attend to his own before he corrects other peoples children and as he permits his to stoop it is hard he will not allow them you and agnes his third daughter must not therefore bring me into discredit with my young friends or give them reason to think that i require more of them than of my own i presume your mother has told all about us our neighbors and our affairs and indeed she may have done that and not said much either so far as i know but we are all well and have much to be grateful for tomorrow we anticipate the pleasure of your brothers his son custis company which is always a source of pleasure to us it is the only time we see him except when the corps come under my view at some of their exercises when my eye is sure to distinguish him among his comrades and follow him over the plain give much love to your dear grandmother grandfather agnes miss sue lucretia and all friends including the servants write sometimes and think always of your affectionate father r e lee in a letter to my mother written many years previous to this time he says i pray god to watch over and direct our efforts in guarding our dear little sonoh what pleasure i lose in being separated from my children nothing can compensate me for that in another letter of about the same time you do not know how much i have missed you and the children my dear mary to be alone in a crowd is very solitary in the woods i feel sympathy with the trees and birds in whose company i take delight but experience no pleasure in a strange crowd i hope you are all well and will continue so and therefore must again urge you to be very prudent and careful of those dear children if i could only get a squeeze at that little fellow turning up his sweet mouth to keese baba you must not let him run wild in my absence and will have to exercise firm authority over all of them this will not require severity or even strictness but constant attention and an unwavering course mildness and forbearance will strengthen their affection for you while it will maintain your control over them in a letter to one of his sons he writes as follows i cannot go to bed my dear son without writing you a few lines to thank you for your letter which gave me great pleasureyou and custis must take great care of your kind mother and dear sisters when your father is dead to do that you must learn to be good be true kind and generous and pray earnestly to god to enable you to keep his commandments and walk in the same all the days of your life i hope to come on soon to see that little baby you have got to show me you must give her a kiss for me and one to all the children to your mother and grandmother the expression of such sentiments as these was common to my father all through his life and to show that it was all children and not his own little folk alone that charmed and fascinated him i quote from a letter to my mother i saw a number of little girls all dressed up in their white frocks and pantalets their hair plaited and tied up with ribbons running and chasing each other in all directions i counted twentythree nearly the same size as i drew up my horse to admire the spectacle a man appeared at the door with the twentyfourth in his arms my friend said i are all these your children yes he said and there are nine more in the house and this is the youngest upon further inquiry however i found that they were only temporarily his and that they were invited to a party at his house he said however he had been admiring them before i came up and just wished that he had a million of dollars and that they were all his in reality i do not think the eldest exceeded seven or eight years old it was the prettiest sight i have seen in the west and perhaps in my life as superintendent of the military academy at west point my father had to entertain a good deal and i remember well how handsome and grand he looked in uniform how genial and bright how considerate of everybodys comfort of mind and body he was always a great favourite with the ladies especially the young ones his fine presence his gentle courteous manners and kindly smile put them at once at ease with him among the cadets at this time were my eldest brother custis who graduated first in his class in 1854 and my fathers nephew fitz lee a third classman besides other relatives and friends saturday being a halfholiday for the cadets it was the custom for all social events in which they were to take part to be placed on that afternoon or evening nearly every saturday a number of these young men were invited to our house to tea or supper for it was a good substantial meal the misery of some of these lads owing to embarrassment possibly from awe of the superintendent was pitiable and evident even to me a boy of ten or eleven years old but as soon as my father got command as it were of the situation one could see how quickly most of them were put at their ease he would address himself to the task of making them feel comfortable and at home and his genial manner and pleasant ways at once succeeded in the spring of 53 my grandmother mrs custis died this was the first death in our immediate family she was very dear to us and was admired esteemed and loved by all who had ever known her bishop meade of virginia writes of her mrs mary custis of arlington the wife of mr washington custis grandson of mrs general washington was the daughter of mr william fitzhugh of chatham scarcely is there a christian lady in our land more honoured than she was and none more loved and esteemed for good sense prudence sincerity benevolence unaffected piety disinterested zeal in every good work deep humanity and retiring modestyfor all the virtues which adorn the wife the mother and the friendi never knew her superior in a letter written to my mother soon after this sad event my father says may god give you strength to enable you to bear and say his will be done she has gone from all trouble care and sorrow to a holy immortality there to rejoice and praise forever the god and saviour she so long and truly served let that be our comfort and that our consolation may our death be like hers and may we meet in happiness in heaven in another letter about the same time he writes she was to me all that a mother could be and i yield to none in admiration for her character love for her virtues and veneration for her memory at this time my fathers family and friends persuaded him to allow r s weir professor of painting and drawing at the academy to paint his portrait as far as i remember there was only one sitting and the artist had to finish it from memory or from the glimpses he obtained as his subject in the regular course of their daily lives at the point this picture shows my father in the undress uniform of a colonel of engineers his appointment of superintendent of the military academy carried with it the temporary rank of colonel of engineers and many think it a very good likeness to me the expression of strength peculiar to his face is wanting and the mouth fails to portray that sweetness of disposition so characteristic of his countenance still it was like him at that time my father never could bear to have his picture taken and there are no likenesses of him that really give his sweet expression sitting for a picture was such a serious business with him that he never could look pleasant in 1855 my father was appointed to the lieutenantcolonelcy of the second cavalry one of the two regiments just raised he left west point to enter upon his new duties and his family went to arlington to live during the fall and winter of 1855 and 56 the second cavalry was recruited and organised at jefferson barracks missouri under the direction of colonel lee and in the following spring was marched to western texas where it was assigned the duty of protecting the settlers in that wild country i did not see my father again until he came to my mother at arlington after the death of her father g w p custis in october 1857 he took charge of my mothers estate after her fathers death and commenced at once to put it in ordernot an easy task as it consisted of several plantations and many negroes i was at a boardingschool after the family returned to arlington and saw my father only during the holidays if he happened to be at home he was always fond of farming and took great interest in the improvements he immediately began at arlington relating to the cultivation of the farm to the buildings roads fences fields and stock so that in a very short time the appearance of everything on the estate was improved he often said that he longed for the time when he could have a farm of his own where he could end his days in quiet and peace interested in the care and improvement of his own land this idea was always with him in a letter to his son written in july 65 referring to some proposed indictments of prominent confederates he says as soon as i can ascertain their intention toward me if not prevented i shall endeavour to procure some humble but quiet abode for your mother and sisters where i hope they can be happy as i before said i want to get in some grass country where the natural product of the land will do much for my subsistence again in a letter to his son dated october 1865 after he had accepted the presidency of washington college lexington virginia i should have selected a more quiet life and a more retired abode than lexington i should have preferred a small farm where i could have earned my daily bread about this time i was given a gun of my own and was allowed to go shooting by myself my father to give me an incentive offered a reward for every crowscalp i could bring him and in order that i might get to work at once advanced a small sum with which to buy powder and shot this sum to be returned to him out of the first scalps obtained my industry and zeal were great my hopes high and by good luck i did succeed in bagging two crows about the second time i went out i showed them with great pride to my father intimating that i should shortly be able to return him his loan and that he must be prepared to hand over to me very soon further rewards for my skill his eyes twinkled and his smile showed that he had strong doubts of my making an income by killing crows and he was right for i never killed another though i tried hard and long i saw but little of my father after we left west point he went to texas as i have stated in 55 and remained until the fall of 57 the time of my grandfathers death he was then at arlington about a year returning to his regiment he remained in texas until the autumn of 59 when he came again to arlington having applied for leave in order to finish the settling of my grandfathers estate during this visit he was selected by the secretary of war to suppress the famous john brown raid and was sent to harpers ferry in command of the united states troops from his memorandum book the following entries were taken october 17 1859 received orders from the secretary of war in person to repair in evening train to harpers ferry reached harpers ferry at 11 pm posted marines in the united states armory waited until

december 2 1859 colonel lee writes as follows to his wife harpers ferry december 1 1859 i arrived here dearest mary yesterday about noon with four companies from fort monroe and was busy all the evening and night getting accommodation for the men etc and posting sentinels and piquets to insure timely notice of the approach of the enemy the night has passed off quietly the feelings of the community seem to be calmed down and i have been received with every kindness mr fry is among the officers from old point there are several young men former acquaintances of ours as cadets mr bingham

to go to baltimore the evening i left you to make arrangements for the transportation of the troops this morning i was introduced to mrs brown who with a mrs tyndall and a mr and mrs mckim all from

1860 he was ordered to take command of the department of texas there he remained a year the first months after his arrival were spent in the vain pursuit of the famous brigand cortinez who was continually stealing across the rio grande burning the homes driving off the stock of the ranchmen and then retreating into mexico the summer months he spent in san antonio and while there interested

i ought no longer to retain my commission in the army i therefore tender my resignation which i request you will recommend for acceptance it would have been presented at once but for the struggle it has cost me to separate myself from a service to which i have devoted the best years of my life and all the ability i possessed during the whole of that timemore than a quarter of a centuryi have experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors and a most cordial friendship from my comrades to no one general have i been as much indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration

virginia april 20 1861 my dear sister i am grieved at my inability to see you i have been waiting for a more convenient season which has brought to many before me deep and lasting regret now we are in a state of war which will yield to nothing the whole south is in a state of revolution into which virginia after a long struggle has been drawn and though i recognise no necessity for this state of things and would have forborne and pleaded to the end for redress of grievances real or supposed yet in my own person i had to meet the question whether i should take part against my native state with all my devotion to the union and the feeling of loyalty and duty of an american citizen i have not been able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives my children my home i have therefore resigned my commission in the army and save in defense of my native state with the sincere hope that my poor services may never be needed i hope i may never be called on to draw my sword i

to the correct course for me to pursue i concluded to resign and sent in my resignation this morning i wished to wait till the ordinance of secession should be acted on by the people of virginia but war seems to have commenced and i am liable at any time to be ordered on duty which i could not conscientiously perform to save me from such a position and to prevent the necessity of resigning under orders i had to act at once and before i could see you again on the subject as i had wished i am now a private citizen and have no other ambition than to remain at home save in defense of my native state i have no desire ever again to draw my sword i send you my warmest love your affectionate brother r e lee i will give here one of my fathers letters written after the war in which is his account

official report of the debate in the senate of the united states on the 19th instant in which you did my the kindness to doubt the correctness of the statement made by the honourable simon cameron in regard to myself i desire that you may feel certain of my conduct on the occasion referred to so far as my individual statement can make you i never intimated to any one that i desired the command of the united states army nor did i ever have a conversation with but one gentleman mr francis preston blair on the subject which was at his invitation and as i understood at the instance of president lincoln after listening to his remarks i declined the offer that he made me to take command of the army that was to be brought into the field stating as candidly and courteously as i could that though opposed to secession and deprecating war i could take no part in an invasion of the southern states i went directly from the interview with mr blair to the office of general scott told him of the proposition that had been made to me and my decision upon reflection after returning to my home i concluded that i ought no longer to retain the commission i held in the united states army and on the second morning thereafter i forwarded my resignation to general scott at the time i hoped that peace would have been preserved that some way would have been found to save the country from the calamities of war and i then had no other intention than to pass the remainder of my life as a private citizen two days afterward upon the invitation of the governor of virginia i repaired to richmond found that the convention then in session had passed the ordinance withdrawing the state from the union and accepted the commission of commander of its forces which was tendered me these are the ample facts of the case and they show that mr cameron has been misinformed i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee my father reached richmond april 22 1861 the next day he was introduced to the virginia convention and offered by them the command of the military forces of his state in his reply to mr john janney the president who spoke for the convention he said mr president and gentlemen of the convention deeply impressed with the solemnity of the occasion on which i appear before you and profoundly grateful for the honour conferred upon me i accept the position your partiality has assigned me though i would greatly have preferred your choice should have fallen on one more capable trusting to almighty god an approving conscience and the aid of my fellow citizens i will devote myself to the defense and service of my native state in whose behalf alone would i have ever drawn my sword on april 26th from richmond he wrote to his wife i am very anxious about you you have to move and make arrangements to go to some point of safety which you must select the mount vernon plate and pictures ought to be secured keep quiet while you remain and in your preparation war is inevitable and there is no telling when it will burst around you virginia yesterday i understand joined the confederate states what policy they may adopt i cannot conjecture may god bless and preserve you and have mercy upon all our people is the constant prayer of your affectionate husband r e lee on april 30th on going to my room last night i found my trunk and sword there and opening them this morning discovered the package of letters and was very glad to learn you were all well and as yet peaceful i fear the latter state will not continue long i think therefore you had better prepare all things for removal that is the plate pictures etc and be prepared at any moment where to go is the difficulty when the war commences no place will be exempt in my opinion and indeed all the avenues into the state will be the scenes of military operations there is no prospect or intention of the government to propose a truce do not be deceived by it may god preserve you all and bring peace to our distracted country again to my mother at arlington richmond may 2 1861 my dear mary i received last night your letter of the 1st with contents it gave me great pleasure to learn that you are all well and in peace you know how pleased i should be to have you and my dear daughters with me that i fear can not be there is no place that i can expect to be but in the field and there is no rest for me to look to but i want you to be in a place of safety we have only to be resigned to gods will and pleasure and do all we can for our protection i have just received custiss letter of the 30th inclosing the acceptance of my resignation it is stated that it will take effect april 25th i resigned on the 20th and wished it to take effect that day i cannot consent to its running on further and he must receive no pay if they tender it beyond that day but return the whole if need be from another letter to my mother dated may 8th i grieve at the necessity that drives you from your home i can appreciate your feelings on the occasion and pray that you may receive comfort and strength in the difficulties that surround you when i reflect upon the calamity impending over the country my own sorrows sink into insignificance be content and resigned to gods will i shall be able to write seldom write to me as you letters will be my greatest comfort i send a check for 500 it is all i have in bank pay the childrens school expenses to my mother still at arlington richmond may 11 1861 i have received your letter of the 9th from arlington i had supposed you were at ravensworth i am glad to hear that you are at peace and enjoying the sweet weather and beautiful flowers you had better complete your arrangements and retire further from the scene of war it may burst upon you at any time it is sad to think of the devastation if not ruin it may bring upon a spot so endeared to us but gods will be done we must be resigned may he guard and keep you all is my constant prayer all this time my father was very hard at work organising and equipping the volunteers who were pouring into richmond from the southern states but he was in constant correspondence with my mother helping her all he could in her arrangements for leaving her home his letters show that he thought of everything even the least and he gave the most particular directions about his family their effects the servants the horses the farm pictures plate and furniture being called to norfolk suddenly before going he wrote to my mother richmond may 16 1861 my dear mary i am called down to norfolk and leave this afternoon i expect to return friday but may be delayed i write to advise you of my absence in case you should not receive answers to any letters that may arrive i have not heard from you since i last wrote nor have i anything to relate i heard from my dear little rob who had an attack of chills and fever he hoped to escape the next paroxysm i witnessed the opening of the convention the episcopal convention of the diocese of virginia yesterday and heard the good bishops bishop meade of virginia sermon being the 50th anniversary of his ministry it was a most impressive scene and more than once i felt the tears coming down my cheek it was from the text and pharoh said unto jacob how old art thou it was full of humility and selfreproach i saw mr walker bishop johns bishop atkinson etc i have not been able to attend any other services and presume the session will not be prolonged i suppose it may be considered a small attendance should custis arrive during my absence i will leave word for him to take my room at the spotswood till my return smith his brother s s lee c s n is well and enjoys a ride in the afternoon with mrs stannard the charming women you know always find him out give much love to cousin anna nannie and dear daughters when rob leaves the university take him with you truly and affectionately r e lee by this time my mother and all the family had left arlington my brother custis had joined my father in richmond the girls had gone to fauquier county to visit relatives and my mother to ravensworth about ten miles from arlington towards fairfax court house where her aunt mrs a m fitzhugh lived always considerate of the happiness and comfort of others my father feared that his wifes presence at ravensworth might possibly bring annoyance to cousin anna as he called our aunt and he wrote to my mother urging her not to remain there he sympathised with her in having to leave her home which she never saw again richmond may 25 1861 i have been trying dearest mary ever since the receipt of your letter by custis to write to you i sympathise deeply in your feelings at leaving your dear home i have experienced them myself and they are constantly revived i fear we have not been grateful enough for the happiness there within our reach and our heavenly father has found it necessary to deprive us of what he has given us i acknowledge my ingratitude my transgressions and my unworthiness and submit with resignation to what he thinks proper to inflict upon me we must trust all then to him and i do not think it prudent or right for you to return there while the united states troops occupy that country i have gone over all this ground before and have just written cousin anna on the subject while writing i received a telegram from cousin john goldsborough a cousin of mrs fitzhugh urging your departure south i suppose he is impressed with the risk of your present position and in addition to the possibility or probability of personal annoyance to yourself i fear your presence may provoke annoyance in cousin anna but unless cousin anna goes with you i shall be distressed about her being there alone if the girls went to kinloch or eastern view you and cousin anna might take care of yourselves because you could get in the carriage and go off in an emergency but i really am afraid that you may prove more harm than comfort to her mr wm c rives has just been in to say that if you and cousin anna will go to his house he will be very glad for you to stay as long as you please that his son has a commodious house just opposite his unoccupied partially furnished that you could if you prefer take that bring up servants and what you desire and remain there as independent as at home i must now leave the matter to you and pray that god may guard you i have no time for more i know and feel the discomfort of your position but it cannot be helped and we must bear our trials like christians if you and cousin anna choose to come here you know how happy we shall be to see you i shall take the field as soon now as i can ever yours truly and devotedly r e lee three days later he was at manassas only a short distance from ravensworth and he sent her this short note manassas may 28 1861 i reached here dearest mary this afternoon i am very much occupied in examining matters and have to go out to look over the ground cousin john tempts me strongly to go down but i never visit for many reasons if for no other to prevent compromising the house for my visit would certainly be known i have written to you fully and to cousin anna i am decidedly of the opinion that it would be better for you to leave on your account and cousin annas my only objection is the leaving of cousin anna alone if she will not go with you if you prefer richmond go with nannie otherwise go to the upper country as john indicates i fear i cannot be with you anywhere i do not think richmond will be permanent truly r i may as well say here that cousin anna never did leave ravensworth during the war she remained there with only a few faithful servants and managed to escape any serious molestation nannie was mrs s s lee who shortly after this time went to richmond on may 25th my father was transferred with all the virginia troops to the confederate states army he ceased to be a majorgeneral and became a brigadier no higher rank having been created as yet in the confederate service later when the rank was created he was made a full general by the end of may to quote from general long lee had organised equipped and sent to the field more than thirty thousand men and various regiments were in a forward state of preparation when the confederate government moved from montgomery to richmond and president davis took charge of all military movements my father was kept near him as his constant and trusted adviser his experience as an engineer was of great service to the young confederacy and he was called upon often for advice for the location of batteries and troops on our different defensive lines in a letter to my mother he speaks of one of these trips to the waters east of richmond richmond june 9 1861 i have just returned from a visit to the batteries and troops on james and york rivers etc where i was some days i called a few hours at the white house saw charlotte and annie fitzhugh was away but got out of the cars as i got in our little boy looked very sweet and seemed glad to kiss me goodbye charlotte said she was going to prepare to leave for the summer but had not determined where to go i could only see some of the servants about the house and the stables they were all well you may be aware that the confederate government is established here yesterday i turned over to it the command of the military and naval forces of the state in accordance with the proclamation of the government and the agreement between the state and the confederate states i do not know what my position will be i should like to retire to private life if i could be with you and the children but if i can be of any service to the state or her cause i must continue mr davis and all his cabinet are here goodbye give much love to kind friends may god guard and bless you them and our suffering country and enable me to perform my duty i think of you constantly write me what you will do direct here always yours r e lee to my mother who was now in fauquier county staying at kinloch mr edward turners home he writes on june 24th from richmond your future arrangements are the source of much anxiety to me no one can say what is in the future nor is it wise to anticipate evil but it is well to prepare for what may reasonably happen and be provided for the worst there is no saying when you can return to your home or what may be its condition when you do return what then can you do in the meantime to remain with friends may be incumbent and where can you go my movements are very uncertain and i wish to take the field as soon as certain arrangements can be made i may go at any moment and to any point where it may be necessary many of our old friends are dropping in e p alexander is here jimmy hill alston jenifer etc and i hear that my old colonel a s johnston is crossing the plains from california as ever r e lee i again quote from a letter to my mother dated richmond july 12 1861 i am very anxious to get into the field but am detained by matters beyond my control i have never heard of the appointment to which you allude of commanderinchief of the confederate states army nor have i any expectation or wish for it president davis holds that position since the transfer of the military operations in virginia to the authorities of the confederate states i have only occupied the position of a general in that service with the duties devolved on me by the president i have been labouring to prepare and get into the field the virginia troops and to strengthen by those from the other states the threatened commands of johnston beauregard huger garnett etc where i shall go i do not know as that will depend upon president davis as usual in getting through with a thing i have broken down a little and had to take my bed last evening but am at my office this morning and hope will soon be right again my young friend mr vest has just returned from a search in the city for dixie and says he has visited every place in richmond without finding it i suppose it is exhausted always yours r e lee the booksellers say dixie is not to be had in virginia r e l on july 21st occurred the battle of manassas in a letter to my mother written on the 27th my father says that indeed was a glorious victory and has lightened the pressure upon our front amazingly do not grieve for the brave dead sorrow for those they left behindfriends relatives and families the former are at rest the latter must suffer the battle will be repeated there in greater force i hope god will again smile on us and strengthen our hearts and arms i wished to partake in the former struggle and am mortified at my absence but the president thought it more important i should be here i could not have done as well as has been done but i could have helped and taken part in the struggle for my home and neighbourhood so the work is done i care not by whom it is done i leave tomorrow for the northwest army i wished to go before as i wrote you and was all prepared but the indications were so evident of the coming battle and in the uncertainty of the result the president forbade my departure now it is necessary and he consents i cannot say for how long but will write you i inclose you a letter from markie miss martha custis williamssecond cousin of my mother afterward mrs admiral carter usn write to her if you can and thank her for her letter to me i have not time my whole time is occupied and all my thoughts and strength are given to the cause to which my life be it long or short will be devoted tell her not to mind the reports she sees in the papers they are made to injure and occasion distrust those that know me will not believe them those that do not will not care for them i laugh at them give love to all and for yourself accept the constant prayers and love of truly yours r e lee it was thought best at this time to send general lee to take command of military operations in west virginia the ordinary difficulties of a campaign in this country of mountains and bad roads were greatly increased by incessant rains sickness of all kinds amongst the new troops and the hostility of many of the inhabitants of the southern cause my fathers letters which i will give here tell of his trials and troubles and describe at the same time the beauty of the scenery and some of the military movements about august 1st he started for his new command and he writes to my mother on his arrival at huntersville pocahontas county now west virginia huntersville august 4 1861 i reached here yesterday dearest mary to visit this portion of the army the day after my arrival at staunton i set off for monterey where the army of general garnetts command is stationed two regiments and a fieldbattery occupy the alleghany mountains in advance about thirty miles and this division guards the road to staunton the division here guards the road leading to the warm springs to milboro and covington two regiments are advanced about twentyeight miles to middle mountain fitzhugh major w h f leegeneral lees second son with his squadron is between that point and this i have not seen him i understand he is well south of here again is another column of our enemies making their way up the kanawha valley and from general wises report are not far from lewisburgh their object seems to be to get possession of the virginia central railroad and the virginia and tennessee railroad by the first they can approach richmond by the last interrupt our reinforcements from the south the points from which we can be attacked are numerous and their means are unlimited so we must always be on the alert my uneasiness on these points brought me out here it is so difficult to get our people unaccustomed to the necessities of war to comprehend and promptly execute the measures required for the occasion general jackson of georgia commands on the monterey line general loring on this line and general wise supported by general floyd on the kanawha line the soldiers everywhere are sick the measles are prevalent throughout the whole army and you know that disease leaves unpleasant results attacks on the lungs typhoid etc especially in camp where accommodations for the sick are poor i travelled from staunton on horseback a part of the road as far as buffalo gap i passed over in the summer of 1840 on my return to st louis after bringing you home if any one had then told me that the next time i travelled that road would have been on my present errand i should have supposed him insane i enjoyed the mountains as i rode along the views are magnificentthe valleys so beautiful the scenery so peaceful what a glorious world almighty god has given us how thankless and ungrateful we are and how we labour to mar his gifts i hope you received my letters from richmond give love to daughter and mildred i did not see rob as i passed through charlottesville he was at the university and i could not stop a few days later there is another letter camp at valley mountain august 9 1861 i have been here dear mary three days coming from monterey to huntersville and thence here we are on the dividing ridge looking north down the tygarts river valley whose waters flow into the monongahela and south towards the elk river and greenbriar flowing into the kanawha in the valley north of us lie huttonsville and beverly occupied by our invaders and the rich mountains west the scene of our former disaster and the cheat mountains east their present stronghold are in full view the mountains are beautiful fertile to the tops covered with the richest sward of bluegrass and white clover the inclosed fields waving with the natural growth of timothy the inhabitants are few and population sparse this is a magnificent grazing country and all it needs is labour to clear the mountainsides of its great growth of timber there surely is no lack of moisture at this time it has rained i believe some portion of every day since i left staunton now it is pouring and the wind having veered around to every point of the compass has settled down to the northeast what that portends in these regions i do not know colonel washington john augustin washington greatnephew of general washington and mt vernons last owner bearing that name captain taylor and myself are in one tent which as yet protects us i have enjoyed the company of fitzhugh since i have been here he is very well and very active and as yet the war has not reduced him much he dined with me yesterday and preserves his fine appetite today he is out reconnoitering and has the full benefit of this rain i fear he is without his overcoat as i do not recollect seeing it on his saddle i told you he had been promoted to a major in cavalry and is the commanding cavalry officer on this line at present he is as sanguine cheerful and hearty as ever i sent him some cornmeal this morning and he sent me some buttera mutual interchange of good things there are but few of your acquaintances in this army i find here in the ranks of one company henry tiffany the company is composed principally of baltimoreansgeorge lemmon and douglas mercer are in it it is a very fine company well drilled and well instructed i find that our friend j j reynolds of west point memory is in command of the troops immediately in front of us he is a brigadiergeneral you may recollect him as the assistant professor of philosophy and lived in the cottage beyond the west gate with his little palefaced wife a great friend of lawrence and markie he resigned on being relieved from west point and was made professor of some college in the west fitzhugh was the bearer of a flag the other day and he recognised him he was very polite and made inquiries of us all i am told they feel very safe and are very confident of success their numbers are said to be large ranging from 12000 to 30000 but it is impossible for me to get correct information either as to their strength or position our citizens beyond this are all on their side our movements seem to be rapidly communicated to them while theirs come to us slowly and indistinctly i have two regiments here with others coming up i think we shall shut up this road to the central railroad which they strongly threaten our supplies come up slowly we have plenty of beef and can get some bread i hope you are well and are content i have heard nothing of you or the children since i left richmond you must write there the men are suffering from the measles etc as elsewhere but are cheerful and lighthearted the atmosphere when it is not raining is delightful you must give much love to daughter and life pet names for his two daughters mary and mildred i want to see you all very much but i know not when that can be may god guard and protect you all in him alone is our hope remember me to ned m edward carter turner of kinloch my fathers cousin and all at kinloch and avenel the house of the berbeleys in fauquier county send word to miss lou washington eldest daughter of john augustin washington that her father is sitting on his blanket sewing the strap on his haversack i think she out to be here to do it always yours r e lee in a letter to his two daughters who were in richmond he writes valley mountain august 29 1861 my precious daughters i have just received your letters of the 24th and am rejoiced to hear that you are well and enjoying the company of your friends it rains here all the time literally there has not been sunshine enough since my arrival to dry my clothes perry his servanthad been in the diningroom at arlington is my washerman and socks and towels suffer but the worst of the rain is that the ground has become so saturated with water that the constant travel on the roads has made them almost impassable so that i cannot get up sufficient supplies for the troops to move it is raining now has been all day last night day before and day before that etc etc but we must be patient it is quite cool too i have on all my winter clothes and am writing in my overcoat all the clouds seem to concentrate over this ridge of mountains and by whatever wind they are driven give us rain the mountains are magnificent the sugarmaples are beginning to turn already and the grass is luxuriant richmond his horse has not been accustomed to such fare or such treatment but he gets along tolerably complains some and has not much superfluous flesh there has been much sickness among the menmeasles etcand the weather has been unfavourable i hope their attacks are nearly over and that they will come out with the sun our party has kept well although we may be too weak to break through the lines i feel well satisfied that the enemy cannot at present reach richmond by either of these routes leading to staunton milborough or covington he must find some other way god bless you my children and preserve you from all harm is the constant prayer of your devoted father r e lee on account of rheumatism my mother was anxious to go to the hot springs in bath county she was now staying at audley clarke county virginia with mrs lorenzo lewis who had just sent her six sons into the army bath county was not very far from the seat of war in western virginia and my father was asked as to the safety of the hot springs from occupation by the enemy he writes as follows to my mother valley mountain september 1 1861 i have received dearest mary your letter of august 18th from audley and am very glad to get news of your whereabouts i am very glad you are enabled to see so many of your friends i hope you have found all well in your tour and am very glad that our cousin esther bears the separation from all her sons so bravely i have no doubt they will do good service in our southern cause and wish they could be placed according to their fancies i fear you have postponed your visit to the hot too late it must be quite cold there now judging from the temperature here and it has been raining in these mountains since july 24th i see fitzhugh quite often though he is encamped four miles from me he is very well and not at all harmed by the campaign we have a great deal of sickness among the soldiers and now those on the sicklist would form an army the measles is still among them though i hope it is dying out but it is a disease which though light in childhood is severe in manhood and prepares the system for other attacks the constant cold rains with no shelter but tents have aggravated it all these drawbacks with impassable roads have paralysed our efforts still i think you will be safe at the hot for the present we are right up to the enemy on three lines and in the kanawha he has been pushed beyond the gauley my poor little rob i never hear from scarcely he is busy i suppose and knows not where to direct with much affection r e lee from the same camp to my mother on september 9th i hope from the tone of your letter that you feel better and wish i could see you and be with you i trust we may meet this fall somewhere if only for a little time i have written to robert telling him if after considering what i have previously said to him on the subject of his joining the company he desires under major ross he still thinks it best for him to do so i will not withhold my consent it seems he will be eighteen i thought seventeen i am unable to judge for him and he must decide for himself in reply to a recent letter from him to me on the same subject i said to him all i could i pray god to bring him to the right conclusion for military news i must refer you to the papers you will see there more than ever occurs and what does occur the relation must be taken with some allowance do not believe anything you see about me there has been no battle only skirmishing with the outposts and nothing done of any moment the weather is still unfavourable to us the roads or rather tracks of mud are almost impassable and the number of sick large truly and devotedly yours r e lee my mother was at the hot springsi had taken her there and was with her i dont now remember why but it was decided that i should return to the university of virginia which opened october 1st and continue my course there while at the springs my mother received this letter from my father valley mount september 17 1861 i received dear mary your letter of the 5th by beverly turner a son of mr edward turner of kinloch who is a nice young soldier i am pained to see find young men like him of education and standing from all the old and respectable families in the state serving in the ranks i hope in time they will receive their reward i met him as i was returning from an expedition to the enemys works which i had hoped to have surprised on the morning of the 12th both at cheat mountain and on valley river all the attacking parties with great labour had reached their destination over mountains considered impassable to bodies of troops notwithstanding a heavy storm that set in the day before and raged all night in which they had to stand up till daylight their arms were then unserviceable and they in poor condition for a fierce assault against artillery and superior numbers after waiting till 10 oclock for the assault on cheat mountain which did not take place and which was to have been the signal for the rest they were withdrawn and after waiting three days in front of the enemy hoping he would come out of his trenches we returned to our position at this place i can not tell you my regret and mortification at the untoward events that caused the failure of the plan i had taken every precaution to ensure success and counted on it but the ruler of the universe willed otherwise and sent a storm to disconcert a welllaid plan and to destroy my hopes we are no worse off now than before except the disclosure of our plan against which they will guard we met with one heavy loss which grieves me deeply colonel washington accompanied fitzhugh on a reconnoitering expedition and i fear they were carried away by their zeal and approached the enemys pickets the first they knew was a volley from a concealed party within a few yards of them their balls passed through the colonels body then struck fitzhughs horse and the horse of one of the men was killed fitzhugh mounted the colonels horse and brought him off i am much grieved he was always anxious to go on these expeditions this was the first day i assented since i had been thrown into such intimate relations with him i had learned to appreciate him very highly morning and evening have i seen him on his knees praying to his maker the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come may god have mercy on us all i suppose you are at the hot springs and will direct to you there our poor sick i know suffer much they bring it on themselves by not doing what they are told they are worse than children for the latter can be forced truly yours r e lee on the same day he wrote the governor of virginia valley mountain september 17 1861 my dear governor i received your very kind note of the 5th instant just as i was about to accompany general lorings command on an expedition to the enemys works in front or i would have before thanked you for the interest you take in my welfare and your too flattering expressions of my ability indeed you overrate me much and i feel humbled when i weigh myself by your standard i am however very grateful for your confidence and i can answer for my sincerity in the earnest endeavour i make to advance the cause i have so much at heart though conscious of the slow progress i make i was very sanguine of taking the enemys works on last thursday morning i had considered the subject well with great effort the troops intended for the surprise had reached their destination having traversed twenty miles of steep rugged mountain paths and the last day through a terrible storm which lasted all night and in which they had to stand drenched to the skin in cold rain still their spirits were good when morning broke i could see the enemys tents on valley river at the point on the huttonsville road just below me it was a tempting sight we waited for the attack on cheat mountain which was to be the signal till 10 a m the men were cleaning their unserviceable arms but the signal did not come all chance for a surprise was gone the provisions of the men had been destroyed the preceding day by the storm they had nothing to eat that morning could not hold out another day and were obliged to be withdrawn the party sent to cheat mountain to take that in rear had also to be withdrawn the attack to come off the east side failed from the difficulties in the way the opportunity was lost and our plan discovered it is a grievous disappointment to me i assure you but for the rainstorm i have no doubt it would have succeeded this governor is for your own eye please do not speak of it we must try again our greatest loss is the death of my dear friend colonel washington he and my son were reconnoitering the front of the enemy they came unawares upon a concealed party who fired upon them within twenty yards and the colonel fell pierced by three balls my sons horse received three shots but he escaped on the colonels horse his zeal for the cause to which he had devoted himself carried him i fear too far we took some seventy prisoners and killed some twentyfive or thirty of the enemy our loss was small besides what i have mentioned our greatest difficulty is the roads it has been raining in these mountains about six weeks it is impossible to get along it is that which has paralysed all our efforts with sincere thanks for your good wishes i am very truly yours r e lee his excellency governor john letcher from camp on sewells mountainquotation from colonel taylors bookfrom professor wm p trentfrom mr daviss memorial addressdefense of southern portschristmas 1861the general visits his fathers gravecommands under the president all the armies of the confederate states the season being too far advanced to attempt any further movements away from our base of supplies and the same reasons preventing any advance of the federal forces the campaign in this part of virginia ended for the winter in the kanawha valley however the enemy had been and were quite active large reinforcements under general rosecrans were sent there to assist general cox the officer in command at that point general loring leaving a sufficient force to watch the enemy at cheat mountain moved the rest of his army to join the commands of generals floyd and wise who were opposing the advance of cox general lee about september 20th reached general floyds camp and immediately proceeded to arrange the lines of defense shortly after his arrival there he wrote to my mother at the hot springs camp on sewells mountain september 26 1881 i have just received dear mary your letter of the 17th and 19th instants with one from robert i have but little time for writing tonight and will therefore write to you having now disposed of business matters i will say how glad i am to hear from you and to learn that you have reached the hot in safety with daughter and rob i pray that its healing waters may benefit you all i am glad to hear of charlotte and the girls and hope all will go well with them i infer you received my letter before leaving valley mountain though you did not direct your letter via lewisburg greenbrier county and hence its delay i told you of the death of colonel washington i grieve for his loss though trust him to the mercy of our heavenly father may he have mercy on us all it is raining heavily the men are all exposed on the mountain with the enemy opposite to us we are without tents and for two nights i have lain buttoned up in my overcoat today my tent came up and i am in it yet i fear i shall not sleep for thinking of the poor men i wrote about socks for myself i have no doubt the yarn ones you mention will be very acceptable to the men here or elsewhere if you can send them here i will distribute them to the most needy tell rob i could not write to him for want of time my heart is always with you and my children may god guard and bless you all is the constant prayer of your devoted husband r e lee to my mother still at the hot springs sewells mountain october 7 1861 i received dear mary your letter by doctor quintard with the cotton socks both were very acceptable though the latter i have not yet tried at the time of their reception the enemy was threatening an attack which was continued till saturday night when under cover of darkness we suddenly withdrew your letter of the 2d with the yarn socks four pairs was handed to me when i was preparing to follow and i could not at the time attend to either but i have since and as i found perry in desperate need i bestowed a couple of pairs on him as a present from you the others i have put in my trunk and suppose they will fall to the lot of meredith his cooka servant from the white house into the state of whose hose i have not yet inquired should any sick man require them first he shall have them but meredith will have no one near to supply him but me and will naturally expect that attention i hope dear mary you and daughter as well as poor little rob have derived some benefit from the sanitary baths of the hot what does daughter intend to do during the winter and indeed what do you it is time you were determining there is no prospect of your returning to arlington i think you had better select some comfortable place in the carolinas or georgia and all board together if mildred goes to school at raleigh why not go there it is a good opportunity to try a warmer climate for your rheumatism if i thought our enemies would not make a vigorous move against richmond i would recommend to rent a house there but under these circumstances i would not feel as if you were permanently located if there i am ignorant where i shall be in the field somewhere i suspect so i have little hope of being with you though i hope to be able to see you i heard from fitzhugh the other day he is well though his command is greatly reduced by sickness i wished much to bring him with me but there is too much cavalry on this line now and i am dismounting them i could not therefore order more the weather is almost as bad here as in the mountains i left there was a drenching rain yesterday and as i had left my overcoat in camp i was thoroughly wet from head to foot it has been raining ever since and is now coming down with a will but i have my clothes out on the bushes and they will be well washed the force of the enemy by a few prisoners captured yesterday and civilians on the road is put down from 17000 to 20000 some went as high as 22000 general floyd thinks 18000 i do not think it exceeds 9000 or 10000 though it exceeds ours i wish he had attacked us as i believe he would have been repulsed with great loss his plan was to attack us at all points at the same time the rumbling of his wheels etc was heard by our pickets but as that was customary at night in the moving and placing of his cannon the officer of the day to whom it was reported paid no particular attention to it supposing it to be a preparation for attack in the morning when day appeared the bird had flown and the misfortune was that the reduced condition of our horses for want of provender exposure to cold rains in these mountains and want of provisions for the men prevented the vigorous pursuit and following up that was proper we can only get up provisions from day to daywhich paralyses our operations i am sorry as you say that the movements of the armies cannot keep pace with the expectations of the editors of papers i know they can regulate matters satisfactorily to themselves on paper i wish they could do so in the field no one wishes them more success than i do and would be happy to see them have full swing i hope something will be done to please them give much love to the children and everybody and believe me always yours r e lee colonel taylor in his four years with general lee says we had now reached the latter days of october the lateness of the season and the condition of the roads precluded the idea of earnest aggressive operations and the campaign in western virginia was virtually concluded judged from its results it must be confessed that this series of operations was a failure at its conclusion a large portion of the state was in possession of the federals including the rich valleys of the ohio and kanawha rivers and so remained until the close of the war for this however general lee cannot reasonably be held accountable disaster had befallen the confederate arms and the worst had been accomplished before he had reached the theatre of operations the alleghanies there constituted the dividing line between the hostile forces and in this network of mountains sterile and rendered absolutely impracticable by a prolonged season of rain nature had provided an insurmountable barrier to operations in this transmontane country it was doubtless because of similar embarrassments that the federal general retired in the face of inferior numbers to a point near his base of supplies professor william p trent in his robert e lee after describing briefly the movements of the contending armies writes there was then nothing to do but to acknowledge the campaign a failure the confederate government withdrew its troops and sent them elsewhere lee whom the press abused and even former friends began to regard as overrated was assigned to command the department of south carolina georgia and florida and her western counties were lost to the old dominion forever it must have been a crushing blow to lee at the time but he bore it uncomplainingly and when all is said no commander however great can succeed against bad roads bad weather sickness of troops lack of judgement and harmony among subordinates and a strong alert enemy yet this is what lee was expected to do mr davis in an address before a memorial meeting at richmond in 1870 speaking of general lee in this campaign said he came back carrying the heavy weight of defeat and unappreciated by the people whom he served for they could not know as i knew that if his plans and orders had been carried out the result would have been victory rather than retreat you did not know it for i should not have known it had he not breathed it in my ear only at my earnest request and begging that nothing be said about it the clamour which then arose followed him when he went to south carolina so that it became necessary on his departure to write a letter to the governor of that state telling him what manner of man he was yet through all this with a magnanimity rarely equalled he stood in silence without defending himself or allowing others to defend him for he was unwilling to offend any one who was wearing a sword and striking blows for the confederacy after returning to richmond my father resumed his position as advisor and counsellor to mr davis from there he writes to my mother who had left the hot springs and gone on to shirley on james river richmond november 5 1861 my dear mary i received last night your letter of the 2d and would have answered it at once but was detained with the secretary till after 11 p m i fear now i may miss the mail saturday evening i tried to get down to you to spend sunday but could find no government boat going down and the passenger boats all go in the morning i then went to the stable and got out my horse but it was near night then and i was ignorant both of the road and distance and i gave it up i was obliged to be here monday and as it would have consumed all sunday to go and come i have remained for better times the president said i could not go today so i must see what can be done tomorrow i will come however wherever you are either shirley or the white house as soon as possible and if not sooner saturday at all events i am as ever yours r e lee the day after this letter was written my father was ordered to south carolina for the purpose of directing and supervising the construction of a line of defense along the southern coast i give here several letters to members of his family which tell of his duties and manner of life savannah november 18 1861 my dear mary this is the first moment i have had to write to you and now am waiting the call to breakfast on my way to brunswick fernandina etc this is my second visit to savannah night before last i returned to coosawhatchie south carolina from charleston where i have placed my headquarters and last night came here arriving after midnight i received in charleston your letter from shirley it was a grievous disappointment to me not to have seen you but better times will come i hope you probably have seen the operations of the enemys fleet since their first attack they have been quiescent apparently confining themselves to hilton head where they are apparently fortifying i have no time for more love to all yours very affectionately and truly r e lee charleston november 15 1861 my precious daughter i have received your letter forwarded to richmond by mr powell and i also got while in the west the letter sent by b turner i can write but seldom but your letters always give me great pleasure i am glad you had such a pleasant visit to kinloch i have passed a great many pleasant days there myself in my young days now you must labour at your books and gain knowledge and wisdom do not mind what rob says i have a beautiful white beard it is much admired at least much remarked on you know i have told you not to believe what the young men tell you i was unable to see your poor mother when in richmond before i could get down i was sent off here another forlorn hope expedition worse than west virginia i have much to do in this country i have been to savannah and have to go again the enemy is quiet after his conquest of port royal harbor and his whole fleet is lying there may god guard and protect you my dear child prays your affectionate father r e lee the above letter was written to his youngest daughter mildred who was at school in winchester virginia two of my sisters were in king george county virginia at clydale the summer home of dr richard stuart with whose family we had been a long time intimate from there they had driven to stratford in westmoreland county about thirty miles distant where my father was born they had written him of this trip and this is his reply savannah november 22 1861 my darling daughters i have just received your joint letter of october 24th from clydale it was very cheering to me and the affection and sympathy you expressed were very grateful to my feelings i wish indeed i could see you be with you and never again part from you god only can give me that happiness i pray for it night and day but my prayers i know are not worthy to be heard i received your former letter in western virginia but had no opportunity to reply to it i enjoyed it nevertheless i am glad you do not wait to hear from me as that would deprive me of the pleasure of hearing from you often i am so pressed with business i am much pleased at your description of stratford and your visit it is endeared to me by many recollections and it has been always a great desire of my life to be able to purchase it now that we have no other home and the one we so loved has been foully polluted the desire is stronger with me than ever the horsechestnut you mention in the garden was planted by my mother i am sorry the vault is so dilapidated you did not mention the spring on of the objects of my earliest recollections i am very glad my precious agnes that you have become so early a riser it is a good habit and in these times for mighty works advantage should be taken of every hour i much regretted being obliged to come from richmond without seeing your poor mother this is my second visit to savannah i have been down the coast to amelia island to examine the defenses they are poor indeed and i have laid off work enough to employ our people a month i hope our enemy will be polite enough to wait for us it is difficult to get our people to realise their position goodbye my dear daughters your affectionate father r e lee to his daughter annie coosawhatchie south carolina december 8 1861 my precious annie i have taken the only quiet time i have been able to find on this holy day to thank you for your letter of the 29th ulto one of the miseries of war is that there is no sabbath and the current of work and strife has no cessation how can we be pardoned for all our offenses i am glad that you have joined your mamma again and that some of you are together at last it would be a great happiness to me were you all at some quiet place remote from the vicissitudes of war where i could consider you safe you must have had a pleasant time at clydale i hope indeed that cedar grove may be saved from the ruin and pillage that other places have received at the hands of our enemies who are pursuing the same course here as the have practised elsewhere unfortunately too the numerous deep estuaries all accessible to their ships expose the multitude of islands to their predatory excursions and what they leave is finished by the negroes whose masters have deserted their plantations subject to visitations of the enemy i am afraid cousin julia mrs richard stuart will not be able to defend her home if attacked by the vandals for they have little respect for anybody and if they catch the doctor doctor richard stuart they will certainly send him to fort warren or la fayette i fear too the yankees will bear off their pretty daughters i am very glad you visited chatham the home of the fitzhughs where my grandmother custis was born i was there many years ago when it was the residence of judge coulter and some of the avenues of poplar so dear to your grandmama still existed i presume they have all gone now the letter that you and agnes wrote from clydale i replied to and sent to that place you know i never have any news i am trying to get a force to make headway on our defenses but it comes in very slow the people do not seem to realise that there is a war it is very warm here if that is news and as an evidence i inclose some violets i plucked in the yard of a deserted house i occupy i wish i could see you and give them in person goodbye my precious child give much love to everybody and believe me your affectionate father r e lee from the same place on december 2d he writes to my mother i received last night dear mary your letter of the 12th and am delighted to learn that you are all well and so many of you are together i am much pleased that fitzhugh has an opportunity to be with you all and will not be so far removed from his home in his new field of action i hope to see him at the head of a find regiment and that he will be able to do good service in the cause of his country if mary and rob get to you christmas you will have quite a family party especially if fitzhugh is not obliged to leave his home and sweet wife before that time i shall think of you all on that holy day more intensely than usual and shall pray to the great god of heaven to shower his blessings upon you in this world and to unite you all in his courts in the world to come with a grateful heart i thank him for his preservation thus far and trust to his mercy and kindness for the future oh that i were more worthy more thankful for all he has done and continues to do for me perry and meredith his two coloured servants send their respects to all truly and affectionately r e lee from the same place on christmas day he writes to my mother i cannot let this day of grateful rejoicing pass dear mary without some communication with you i am thankful for the many among the past that i have passed with you and the remembrance of them fills me with pleasure for those on which we have been separated we must not repine now we must be content with the many blessings we receive if we can only become sensible of our transgressions so as to be fully penitent and forgiven that this heavy punishment under which we labour may with justice be removed from us and the whole nation what a gracious consummation of all that we have endured it will be i hope you had a pleasant visit to richmond if you were to see this place i think you would have it too i am here but little myself the days i am not here i visit some point exposed to the enemy and after our dinner at early candlelight am engaged in writing till eleven or twelve oclock at night as to our old home if not destroyed it will be difficult ever to be recognised even if the enemy had wished to preserve it it would almost have been impossible with the number of troops encamped around it the change of officers etc the want of fuel shelter etc and all the dire necessities of war it is vain to think of its being in a habitable condition i fear too books furniture and the relics of mount vernon will be gone it is better to make up our minds to a general loss they cannot take away the remembrance of the spot and the memories of those that to us rendered it sacred that will remain to us as long as life will last and that we can preserve in the absence of a home i wish i could purchase stratford that is the only other place that i could go to now accessible to us that would inspire me with feelings of pleasure and local love you and the girls could remain there in quiet it is a poor place but we could make enough cornbread and bacon for our support and the girls could weave us clothes i wonder if it is for sale and at how much ask fitzhugh to try to find out when he gets to fredericksburg you must not build your hopes on peace on account of the united states going into a war with england on account of the trent affair she will be very loath to do that notwithstanding the bluster of the northern papers her rulers are not entirely mad and if they find england is in earnest and that war or a restitution of their captives must be the consequence they will adopt the latter we must make up our minds to fight our battles and win our independence alone no one will help us we require no extraneous aid if true to ourselves but we must be patient it is not a light achievement and cannot be accomplished at once i wrote a few days since giving you all the news and have now therefore nothing to relate the enemy is still quiet and increasing in strength we grow in size slowly but are working hard i have had a day of labour instead of rest and have written intervals to some of the children i hope they are with you and inclose my letters affectionately and truly r e lee in the next letter to my mother he describes a visit to the grave of his father at dungeness on cumberland island georgia dungeness was presented to general nathaniel green by the state of georgia for services rendered her in the revolution general henry lee returning from the west indies where he had been for some months on account of his health landed there and in a few days died march 15 1818 he was most kindly cared for by the daughter of his old commander and was buried there in the garden of dungeness at the time of my fathers visit the place belonged to a greatnephew of general green mr nightingale coosawhatchie south carolina january 18 1862 on my return day before yesterday from florida dear mary i received your letter of the 1st inst i am very glad to find that you had a pleasant family meeting christmas and that it was so large i am truly grateful for all the mercies we enjoy notwithstanding the miseries of war and join heartily in the wish that the next year may find us at peace with all the world i am delighted to hear that our little grandson his first grandchildson of my brother fitzhugh he died in 1863 is improving so fast and is becoming such a perfect gentleman may his path be strewn with flowers and his life with happiness i am very glad to hear also that his dear papa is promoted it will be gratifying to him and increase i hope his means of usefulness robert wrote me he saw him on his way through charlottesville with his squadron and that he was well while at fernandina i went over to cumberland island and walked up to dungeness the former residence of general green it was my first visit to the house and i had the gratification at length of visiting my fathers grave he died there you may recollect on his way from the west indies and was interred in one corner of the family cemetery the spot is marked by a plain marble slab with his name age and her daughter mrs shaw and her husband the place is at present owned by mr nightingale nephew of mrs shaw who married a daughter of mr james king the family have moved into the interior of georgia leaving only a few servants and a white gardener on the place the garden was beautiful inclosed by the finest hedge i have ever seen it was of the wild olive which in mrs shaws lifetime during my tour of duty in savannah in early life was so productive had been destroyed by an insect that has proved fatal to the orange on the coast of georgia and florida there was a fine grove of olives from which i learn mr nightingale procures oil the garden was filled with roses and beautiful vines the names of which i do not know among them was the tomatovine in full bearing with the ripe fruit on it there has yet been no frost in that region of country this winter i went in the diningroom and parlour in which the furniture still remained the house has never been finished but is a fine large one and beautifully located a magnificent grove of liveoaks envelops the road from the landing to the house love to everybody and god bless you all truly and faithfully yours r e lee from the same place there is another letter to my mother coosawhatchie south carolina january 28 1862 i have just returned from charleston and received your letter of the 14th dear mary i was called to charleston by the appearance off the bar of a fleet of vessels the true character and intent of which could not be discerned during the continuance of the storm which obscured the view saturday however all doubt was dispelled and from the beach on sullivans island the preparations for sinking them were plainly seen twentyone were visible the first day of my arrival but at the end of the storm saturday only seventeen were seen five of these were vessels of war what became of the other four is not known the twelve old merchantmen were being stripped of their spars masts etc and by sunset seven were prepared apparently for sinking across the mouth of the maffitt channel they were placed in a line about two hundred yards apart about four miles from fort moultrie they will do but little harm to the channel i think but may deter vessels from running out at night for fear of getting on them there now seem to be indications of a movement against savannah the enemys gunboats are pushing up the creek to cut off communication between the city and fort pulaski on cockspur island unless i have better news i must go there today there are so many points of attack and so little means to meet them on the water that there is but little rest perry and meredith are well and send regards to everybody very truly and sincerely yours r e lee it was most important that the defenses of charleston and savannah should be made as strong as possible the difficulties in the way were many and great but general lees perseverance overcame most of them the result was that neither of those cities fell till the close of the war and a region of country was preserved to the confederacy necessary for the feeding of its armies of course all of this was not accomplished by my father alone in the four months he was there but the plans of defense he laid down were successfully followed while in savannah he writes to my mother savannah february 8 1862 i wrote to you dear mary the day i left coosawhatchie for this place i have been here ever since endeavouring to push forward the work for the defense of the city which has lagged terribly and which ought to have been finished but it is difficult to arouse ourselves from ease and comfort to labour and selfdenial guns are scarce as well as ammunition and i shall have to break up batteries on the coast to provide i fear for this city our enemies are endeavouring to work their way through the creeks that traverse the impassable marshes stretching along the interior of the coast and communicating with the sounds and sea through which the savannah flows and thus avoid the entrance of the river commanded by fort pulaski their boats require only seven feet of water to float them and the tide rises seven feet so that at high water they can work their way and rest on the mud at low they are also provided with dredges and appliances for removing obstructions through the creeks in question which cannot be guarded by batteries i hope however we shall be able to stop them and i daily pray to the giver of all victories to enable us to do so i trust you are all well and doing well and wish i could do anything to promote either i have more here than i can do and more i fear than i can well accomplish it is so very hard to get anything done and while all wish well and mean well it is so different to get them to act energetically and promptly the news from kentucky and tennessee is not favourable but we must make up our minds to meet with reverses and overcome them i hope god will at last crown our efforts with success but the contest must be long and severe and the whole country has to go through much suffering it is necessary we should be humbled and taught to be less boastful less selfish and more devoted to right and justice to all the world always yours r e lee to my mother savannah february 23 1862 i have been wishing dear mary to write to you for more than a week but every day and every hour seem so taken up that i have found it impossible the news from tennessee and north carolina is not all cheering and disasters seem to be thickening around us it calls for renewed energies and redoubled strength on our part and i hope will produce it i fear our soldiers have not realised the necessity for the endurance and labour they are called upon to undergo and that it is better to sacrifice themselves than our cause god i hope will shield us and give us success here the enemy is progressing slowly in his designs and does not seem prepared or to have determined when or where to make his attack his gunboats are pushing up all the creeks and marshes of the savannah and have attained a position so near the river as to shell the steamers navigating it none have as yet been struck i am engaged in constructing a line of defense at fort jackson which if time permits and guns can be obtained i hope will keep them out they can bring such overwhelming force in all their movements that it has the effect to demoralise our new troops the accounts given in the papers of the quantity of cotton shipped to new york are of course exaggerated it is cotton in the seed and dirt and has to be ginned and cleaned after its arrival it is said that the negroes are employed in picking and collecting it and are paid a certain amount but all these things are gathered from rumour and can only be believed as they appear probable which this seems to be i went yesterday to church being the day appointed for fasting and prayer i wish i could have passed it more devoutly the bishop elliott gave a most beautiful prayer for the president which i hope may be heard and answered here the yellow jasmine redbud orangetree etc perfume the whole woods and the japonicas and azaleas cover the garden perry and meredith are well may god bless and keep you always is the constant prayer of your husband r e lee to his daughter annie savannah march 2 1862 my precious annie it has been a long time since i have written to you but you have been constantly in my thoughts i think of you all separately and collectively in the busy hours of the day and the silent hours of the night and the recollection of each and every one whiles away the long night in which my anxious thoughts drive away sleep but i always feel that you and agnes at those times are sound asleep and that is immaterial to either where the blockaders are or what their progress is in the river i hope you are all well and as happy as you can be in these perilous times to our country they look dark at present and it is plain we have not suffered enough laboured enough repented enough to deserve success but they will brighten after awhile and i trust that a merciful god will arouse us to a sense of our danger bless our honest efforts and drive back our enemies to their homes our people have not been earnest enough have thought too much of themselves and their ease and instead of turning out to a man have been content to nurse themselves and their dimes and leave the protection of themselves and families to others to satisfy their consciences they have been clamorous in criticising what others have done and endeavoured to prove that they ought to do nothing this is not the way to accomplish our independence i have been doing all i can with our small means and slow workmen to defend the cities and coast here against ordinary numbers we are pretty strong but against the hosts our enemies seem able to bring everywhere there is no calculating but if our men will stand to their work we shall give them trouble and damage them yet they have worked their way across the marshes with their dredges under cover of their gunboats to the savannah river about fort pulaski i presume they will endeavour to reduce the fort and thus open a way for their vessels up the river but we have an interior line they must force before reaching the city it is on this line we are working slowly to my anxious mind but as fast as i can drive them goodbye my dear child may god bless you and our poor country your devoted father r e lee soon after this letter was written my father was recalled to richmond and was assigned on the 13th of march under the direction of the president to the conduct of the military operations of all the armies of the confederate states four years with general lee my mother was still at the white house my brothers place on the pamunkey and there my father wrote to her richmond march 14 1862 my dear mary i have been trying all the week to write to you but have not been able i have been placed on duty here to conduct operations under the direction of the president it will give me great pleasure to do anything i can to relieve him and serve the country but i do not see either advantage or pleasure in my duties but i will not complain but do my best i do not see at present either that it will enable me to see much more of you in the present condition of affairs no one can foresee what may happen nor in my judgement is it advisable for any one to make arrangements with a view to permanency or pleasure the presence of some one at the white house is necessary as long as practicable how long it will be practicable for you an charlotte to remain there i cannot say the enemy is pushing us back in all directions and how far he will be successful depends much upon our efforts and the mercy of providence i shall in all human probability soon have to take the field so for the present i think things had better remain as they are write me your views if you think it best for you to come to richmond i can soon make arrangements for your comfort and shall be very glad of your company and presence we have experienced a great affliction both in our private and public relations our good and noble bishop meade died last night he was very anxious to see you sent you his love and kindest remembrances and had i known in time yesterday i should have sent expressly for you to come up but i did not know of his wish or condition till after the departure of the cars yesterday between 6 and 7 p m yesterday he sent for me said he wished to bid me goodbye and to give me his blessing which he did in the most affecting manner called me robert and reverted to the time i used to say the catechism to him he invoked the blessing of god upon me and the country he spoke with difficulty and pain but was perfectly calm and clear his hand was then cold and pulseless yet he shook mine warmly i neer shall look upon his like again he died during the night i presume the papers of tomorrow will tell you all very truly and sincerely r e lee the next day he again writes to my mother richmond march 15 1861 my dear mary i wrote you yesterday by mail on returning to my quarters last night after 11 p m custis informed me robert had arrived and had made up his mind to go into the army he stayed at the spottswood and this morning i went with him to get his overcoat blankets etc there is great difficulty in procuring what is good they all have to be made and he has gone to the office of the adjutantgeneral of virginia to engage in the service god grant it may be for his good as he has permitted it i must be resigned i told him of the exemption granted by the secretary of war to the professors and students of the university but he expressed no desire to take advantage of it it would be useless for him to go if he did not improve himself nor would i wish him to go merely for exemption as i have done all in the matter that seems proper and right i must now leave the rest in the hands of our merciful god i hope our son will do his duty and make a good soldier i had expected yesterday to go to north carolina this morning but the president changed his mind i should like to go to see you tomorrow but in the present condition of things do not feel that i ought to be absent i may have to go to north carolina or norfolk yet new berne n c has fallen into the hands of the enemy in arkansas our troops under van dorn have had a hard battle but nothing decisive gained four generals killedmcintosh mccullogh herbert and slack general price wounded loss on both sides said to be heavy very truly yours r e lee volunteer in rockbridge artilleryfour years with general lee quotedmeeting between father and sonpersonal characteristics of the generaldeath of his daughter anniehis son robert raised from the ranksthe horses grace darling and travellerfredricksburgfreeing slaves like all the students at the university i was wild to go into the army and wrote my father that i was afraid the war would be over before i had a chance to serve his reply was that i need have no fear of that contingency that i must study hard and fit myself to be useful to my country when i was old enough to be of real service to her so very properly i was not allowed to have my wish then in a letter to my mother written april 61 he says i wrote to robert that i could not consent to take boys from their schools and young men from their colleges and put them in the ranks at the beginning of a war when they are not wanted and when there are men enough for that purpose the war may last ten years where are our ranks to be filled from then i was willing for his company to continue at their studies to keep up its organisation and to perfect themselves in their military exercises and to perform duty at the college but not to be called into the field i therefore wished him to remain if the exercises at the college are suspended he can then come home but in the spring of 62 he allowed me to volunteer and i having selected the company i wished to join the rockbridge artillery he gave his approval and wrote me to come to richmond where he would give me my outfit he was just as sweet and loving to me then as in the old days i had seen so little of him during the last six years that i stood somewhat in awe of him i soon found however that i had no cause for such a feeling he took great pains in getting what was necessary for me the baggage of a private in a confederate battery was not extensive how little was needed my father even at that time did not know for though he was very careful in providing me with the least amount he thought necessary i soon found by experience that he had given me a great deal too much it was characteristic of his consideration for others and the unselfishness of his nature that at this time when weighed down harassed and burdened by the cares incident to bringing the untrained forces of the confederacy into the field and preparing them for a struggle the seriousness of which he knew better than any one he should give his time and attention to the minute details of fitting out his youngest son as a private soldier i think it worthy of note that the son of the commanding general enlisting as a private in his army was not thought to be anything remarkable or unusual neither my mother my family my friends nor myself expected any other course and i do not suppose it ever occurred to my father to think of giving me an office which he could easily have done i know it never occurred to me nor did i ever hear at that time or afterwards from anyone that i might have been entitled to better rank than that of a private because of my fathers prominence in virginia and in the confederacy with the good advice to be obedient to all authority to do my duty in everything great or small he bade me goodbye and sent me off to the valley of virginia where the command in which i was about to enlist were serving under stonewall jackson of my fathers military duties at this time colonel taylor in his four years with general lee says exercising a constant supervision over the condition of affairs at each important point thoroughly informed as to the resources and necessities of the several commanders of armies in the field as well as of the dangers which respectively threatened them he was enabled to give them wise counsel to offer them valuable suggestions and to respond to their demands for assistance and support to such extent as the limited resources of the government would permit it was in great measure due to his advice and encouragement that general magruder so stoutly and so gallantly held his lines on the peninsula against general mcclellan until troops could be sent to his relief from general johnstons army i recollect a telegraphic despatch received by general lee from general magruder in which he stated that a council of war which he had convened had unanimously determined that his army should retreat in reply to which general lee urged him to maintain his lines and to make as bold a front as possible and encouraged him with the prospect of being reinforced no better illustration of the nature and importance of the duty performed by general lee while in this position can be given than the following letterone of a number of similar importwritten by him to general jackson the rough or original draft of which is still in my possession headquarters richmond virginia april 29 1862 majorgeneral t j jackson commanding etc swift run gap virginia general i have had the honour to receive your letter of yesterdays date from the reports that reach me that are entitled to credit the force of the enemy opposite fredericksburg is represented as too large to admit of any diminution whatever of our army in that vicinity at present as it might not only invite an attack on richmond but jeopard the safety of the army in the peninsula i regret therefore that your request to have five thousand men sent from that army to reinforce you cannot be complied with can you not draw enough from the command of general edward johnson to warrant you in attacking banks the last return received from that army show a present force of upward of thirtyfive hundred which it is hoped has since increased by recruits and returned furloughs as he does not appear to be pressed it is suggested that a portion of his force might be temporarily removed from its present position and made available for the movement in question a decisive and successful blow at bankss column would be fraught with the happiest results and i deeply regret my inability to send you the reinforcements you ask if however you think the combined forces of generals ewell and johnson with your own inadequate for the move general ewell might with the assistance of general andersons army near fredericksburg strike at mcdowells army between that city and acquia with much promise of success provided you feel sufficiently strong alone to hold banks in check very truly yours r e lee the reader will observe that this letter bears the date april 29 1862 on may 5th or 6th general jackson formed a junction between his own command and that of general edward johnson on may 8th he defeated milroy at mcdowell soon thereafter the command of general ewell was united to that already under jackson and on the 25th of the same month banks was defeated and put to flight other incidents might be cited to illustrate this branch of the important service rendered at this period by general lee the line of earthworks around the city of richmond and other preparations for resisting an attack testified to the immense care and labour bestowed upon the defense of the capital so seriously threatened by the army of general mcclellan on may 31st the battle of seven pines was fought and general joseph e johnston commanding the confederate army was severely wounded the next day by order of the president general lee took command of the army of northern virginia the day after the battle of cold harbor during the seven days fighting around richmond was the first time i met my father after i had joined general jackson the tremendous work stonewalls men had performed including the rapid march from the valley of virginia the short rations the bad water and the great heat had begun to tell upon us and i was pretty well worn out on this particular morning my battery had not moved from its bivouac ground of the previous night but was parked in an open field all ready waiting orders most of the men were lying down many sleeping myself among the latter number to get some shade and to be out of the way i had crawled under a caisson and was busy making up many lost hours of rest suddenly i was rudely awakened by a comrade prodding me with a spongestaff as i had failed to be aroused by his call and was told to get up and come out that some one wished to see me half awake i staggered out and found myself face to face with general lee and his staff their fresh uniforms bright equipments and wellgroomed horses contrasted so forcibly with the warworn appearance of our command that i was completely dazed it took me a moment or two to realise what it all meant but when i saw my fathers loving eyes and smile it became clear to me that he had ridden by to see if i was safe and to ask how i was getting along i remember well how curiously those with him gazed at me and i am sure that it must have struck them as very odd that such a dirty ragged unkempt youth could have been the son of this grandlooking victorious commander i was introduced recently to a gentleman now living in washington who when he found out my name said he had met me once before and that it was on this occasion at that time he was a member of the tenth virginia infantry jacksons division and was camped near our battery seeing general lee and staff approach he with others drew near to have a look at them and thus witnessed the meeting between father and son he also said that he had often told of this incident as illustrating the peculiar composition of our army after mcclellans change of base to harrisons landing on james river the army lay inactive around richmond i had a short furlough on account of sickness and saw my father also my mother and sisters who were then living in richmond he was the same loving father to us all as kind and thoughtful of my mother who as an invalid and of us his children as if our comfort and happiness were all he had to care for his great victory did not elate him so far as one could see in a letter of july 9th to my mother he says i have returned to my old quarters and am filled with gratitude to our heavenly father for all the mercies he has extended to us our success has not been so great or complete as we could have desired but god knows what is best for us our enemy met with a heavy loss from which it must take him some time to recover before he can recommence his operations the honourable alexander h stephens vicepresident of the confederate states says of general lee what i had seen general lee to be at firstchildlike in simplicity and unselfish in his characterhe remained unspoiled by praise and by success he was the same in victory or defeat always calm and contained jackson having had a short rest was now moved up to gordonsville i rejoined my command and went with him supplied with new clothes and a fresh stock of health in a letter to his three daughters who were in north carolina dated richmond july 18 1862 he writes describing my condition rob came out to see me one afternoon he had been much worn down by his marching and fighting and had gone to his mamma to get a little rest he was thin but well but not being able to get a clean shirt has not gone to see miss norvell he has rejoined his company and gone off with general jackson as good as new again i hope inasmuch as your mother thought by means of a bath and a profusion of soap she had cleansed the outward man considerably and replenished his lost wardrobe from gordonsville we were moved on to orange county and then commenced that series of manoeuvres by the army of northern virginia beginning with the battle of cedar mountain and ending with second manassas when i again saw my father he rode at the head of longstreets men on the field of manassas and we of jacksons corps hard pressed for two days welcomed him and the divisions which followed him with great cheers two rifleguns from our battery had been detached and sent to join longstreets advance artillery under general stephen d lee moving into action on our right i was number 1 at one of these guns we advanced rapidly from hill to hill firing as fast as we could trying to keep ahead of our gallant comrades just arrived as we were ordered to cease firing from the last position we took and the breathless cannoneers were leaning on their guns general lee and staff galloped up and from this point of vantage scanned the movements of the enemy and of our forces the general reined in traveller close by my gun not fifteen feet from me i looked at them all some few minutes and then went up and spoke to captain mason of the staff who had not the slightest idea who i was when he found me out he was greatly amused and introduced me to several others whom i already knew my appearance was even less prepossessing that when i had met my father at cold harbour for i had been marching night and day for four days with no opportunity to wash myself or my clothes my face and hands were blackened with powdersweat and the few garments i had on were ragged and stained with the red soil of that section when the general after a moment or two dropped his glass to his side and turned to his staff captain mason said general here is some one who wants to speak to you the general seeing a muchbegrimed artilleryman spongestaff in hand said well my many what can i do for you i replied why general dont you know me and he of course at once recognised me and was very much amused at my appearance and most glad to see that i was safe and well we of the ranks used to have our opinions on all subjects the armies their generals and their manoeuvres were freely discussed if there was one point on which the entire army was unanimousi speak of the rank and fileit was that we were not in the least afraid of general pope but were perfectly sure of whipping him whenever we could meet him the passages i quote here from two of general lees letters indicate that this feeling may possibly have extended to our officers in a letter to my mother from near richmond dated july 28 1862 he says when you write to rob tell him to catch pope for me and also bring in his cousin louis marshall who i am told is on his staff i could forgive the latters fighting against us but not his joining pope and again johnny lee his nephew saw louis marshall after jacksons last battle who asked him kindly after his old uncle and said his mother was well johnny said louis looked wretched himself i am sorry he is in such bad company but i suppose he could not help it as one of the army of northern virginia i occasionally saw the commanderinchief on the march or passed the headquarters close enough to recognise him and members of his staff but as a private soldier in jacksons corps did not have much time during that campaign for visiting and until the battle of sharpsburg i had no opportunity of speaking to him on that occasion our battery had been severely handled losing many men and horses having three guns disabled we were ordered to withdraw and while moving back we passed general lee and several of his staff grouped on a little knoll near the road having no definite orders where to go our captain seeing the commanding general halted us and rode over to get some instructions some others and myself went along to see and hear general lee was dismounted with some of his staff around him a courier holding his horse captain poague commanding our battery the rockbridge artillery saluted reported our condition and asked for instructions the general listening patiently looked at ushis eyes passing over me without any sign of recognitionand then ordered captain poague to take the most serviceable horses and men man the uninjured gun send the disabled part of his command back to refit and report to the front for duty as poague turned to go i went up to speak to my father when he found out who i was he congratulated me on being well and unhurt i then said general are you going to send us in again yes my son he replied with a smile you all must do what you can to help drive these people back this meeting between general lee and his son has been told very often and in many different ways but the above is what i remember of the circumstances he was much on foot during this part of the campaign and moved about either in an ambulance or on horseback with a courier leading his horse the accident which temporarily disabled him happened before he left virginia he had dismounted and was sitting on a fallen log with the bridle reins hung over his arm traveller becoming frightened at something suddenly dashed away threw him violently to the ground spraining both hands and breaking a small bone in one of them a letter written some weeks afterward to my mother alludes to this meeting with his son and to the condition of his hands i have not laid eyes on rob since i saw him in the battle of sharpsburggoing in with a single gun of his for the second time after his company had been withdrawn in consequence of three of its guns having been disabled custis has seen him and says he is very well and apparently happy and content my hands are improving slowly and with my left hand i am able to dress and undress myself which is a great comfort my right is becoming of some assistance too thought it is still swollen and sometimes painful the bandages have been removed i am now able to sign my name it has been six weeks today since i was injured and i have at last discarded the sling after the army recrossed the potomac into virginia we were camped for some time in the vicinity of winchester one beautiful afternoon in october a courier from headquarters rode up to our camp found me out and handed me a note from my father it told me of the death of my sister annie as i have lost this letter to me i quote from one to my mother about the same time it was dated october 26 1862 i cannot express the anguish i feel at the death of our sweet annie to know that i shall never see her again on earth that her place in our circle which i always hoped one day to enjoy is forever vacant is agonising in the extreme but god in this as in all things has mingled mercy with the blow in selecting that one best prepared to leave us may you be able to join me in saying his will be done i know how much you will grieve and how much she will be mourned i wish i could give you any comfort but beyond our hope in the great mercy of god and the belief that he takes her at the time and place when it is best for her to go there is none may that same mercy be extended to us all and may we be prepared for his summons in a letter to my sister mary one month later from camp near fredericksburg the death of my dear annie was indeed to me a bitter pang but the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord in the quiet hours of the night when there is nothing to lighten the full weight of my grief i feel as if i should be overwhelmed i have always counted if god should spare me a few days after this civil war has ended that i should have her with me but year after year my hopes go out and i must be resigned to this daughter whose loss grieved him so he was specially devoted she died in north carolina at the warren white sulphur springs at the close of the war the citizens of the county erected over her grave a handsome monument general lee was invited to be present at the ceremonies of the unveiling in his reply he says i have always cherished the intention of visiting the tomb of her who never gave me aught but pleasure though absent in person my heart will be with you and my sorrow and devotions will be mingled with yours i inclose according to your request the date of my daughters birth and the inscription proposed for the monument over her tomb the latter are the last lines of the hymn which she asked for just before her death a visitor to her grave some years after the war thus describes it in the beautiful and quiet graveyard near the springs a plain shaft of native granite marks the grave of this beloved daughter on one side is cut in the stone annie c lee daughter of general r e lee and mary c leeand on the oppositeborn at arlington june 18 1839 and died at white sulphur springs warren county north carolina oct 20 1862 on another side are the lines selected by her father perfect and true are all his ways whom heaven adores and earth obeys that autumn i was offered the position of lt and a d c on the staff of my brother w h f lee just promoted from the colonelcy of the 9th virginia cavalry to the command of a brigade in the same arm of the service my father had told me when i joined the army to do my whole duty faithfully not to be rash about volunteering for any service out of my regular line and always to accept promotion after consulting him it was decided that i should take the position offered and he presented me with a horse and one of his swords my promotion necessitated my having an honourable discharge as a private from the ranks and this i obtained in the proper way from general stonewall jackson commanding the corps of which my company was a part and was thus introduced for the first time to that remarkable man having served in his command since my enlistment i had been seeing him daily old jack at a distance was as familiar to me as one of the battery guns but i had never met him and felt much awe at being ushered into his presence this feeling however was groundless for he was seemingly so much embarrassed by the interview that i really felt sorry for him before he dismissed me with my discharge papers properly made out and signed i had received a letter from my father telling me to come to him as soon as i had gotten my discharge from my company so i proceeded at once to his headquarters which were situated near orange court house on a wooded hill just east of the village i found there the horse which he gave me she was a daughter of his mare grace darling and though not so handsome as her mother she inherited many of her good qualities and carried me well until the end of the war and for thirteen years afterward she was four years old a solid bay and never failed me a single day during three years hard work the general was on the point of moving his headquarters down to fredericksburg some of the army having already gone forward to that city i think the camp was struck the day after i arrived and as the generals hands were not yet entirely well he allowed me as a great favour to ride his horse traveller amongst the soldiers this horse was as well known as was his master he was a handsome irongray with black pointsmane and tail very darksixteen hands high and five years old he was born near the white sulphur springs west virginia and attracted the notice of my father when he was in that part of the state in 1861 he was never known to tire and though quiet and sensible in general and afraid of nothing yet if not regularly exercised he fretted a good deal especially in a crowd of horses but there can be no better description of this famous horse than the one given by his master it was dictated to his daughter agnes at lexington virginia after the war in response to some artist who had asked for a description and was corrected in his own handwriting if i were an artist like you i would draw a true picture of travellerrepresenting his fine proportions muscular figure deep chest and short back strong haunches flat legs small head broad forehead delicate ears quick eye small feet and black mane and tail such a picture would inspire a poet whose genius could then depict his worth and describe his endurance of toil hunger thirst heat cold and the dangers and sufferings through which he passed he could dilate upon his sagacity and affection and his invariable response to every wish of his rider he might even imagine his thoughts through the long night marches and days of battle through which he has passed but i am no artist i can only say he is a confederate gray i purchased him in the mountains of virginia in the autumn of 1861 and he has been my patient follower ever sinceto georgia the carolinas and back to virginia he carried me through the seven days battle around richmond the second manassas at sharpsburg fredericksburg the last day at chancellorsville to pennsylvania at gettysburg and back to the rappahannock from the commencement of the campaign in 1864 at orange till its close around petersburg the saddle was scarcely off his back as he passed through the fire of the wilderness spottsylvania cold harbour and across the james river he was almost in daily requisition in the winter of 186465 on the long line of defenses from chickahominy north of richmond to hatchers run south of the appomattox in the campaign of 1865 he bore me from petersburg to the final days at appomattox court house you must know the comfort he is to me in my present retirement he is well supplied with equipments two sets have been sent to him from england one from the ladies of baltimore and one was made for him in richmond but i think his favourite is the american saddle from st louis of all his companions in toil richmond brown roan ajax and quiet lucy long he is the only one that retained his vigour the first two expired under their onerous burden and the last two failed you can i am sure from what i have said paint his portrait the general had the strongest affection for traveller which he showed on all occasions and his allowing me to ride him on this long march was a great compliment possibly he wanted to give me a good hammering before he turned me over to the cavalry during my soldier life so far i had been on foot having backed nothing more lively than a tired artillery horse so i mounted with some misgivings though i was very proud of my steed my misgivings were fully realised for traveller would not walk a step he took a short high trota bucktrot as compared with a buckjumpand kept it up to fredericksburg some thirty miles though young strong and tough i was glad when the journey ended this was my first introduction to the cavalry service i think i am safe in saying that i could have walked the distance with much less discomfort and fatigue my father having thus given me a horse and presented me with one of his swords also supplied my purse so that i could get myself an outfit suitable to my new position and he sent me on to join my command stationed not far away on the rappahannock southward from fredericksburg as an officer in the cavalry on the staff i had more frequent opportunities of seeing my father than as a private in the artillery in the course of duty i was sometimes sent to him to report the condition of affairs at the front or on the flank of the army and i also occasionally paid him a visit at these times he would take me into his tent talk to me about my mother and sisters about my horse and myself or the people and the country where my command happened to be stationed i think my presence was very grateful to him and he seemed to brighten up when i came i remember he always took it as a matter of course that i must be hungry and i was for three years so he invariably made his messsteward bryan give me something to eat if i did not have time to wait for the regular meal his headquarters at this time just before the battle of fredericksburg and after were at a point on the road between fredericksburg and hamiltons crossing selected on account of its accessibility notwithstanding there was nearby a good house vacant he lived in his tents his quarters were very unpretentious consisting of three or four walltents and several more common ones they were pitched on the edge of an old pine field near a grove of forest trees from which he drew his supply of firewood while the pines helped to shelter his tents and horses from the cold winds though from the outside they were rather dismal especially through the dreary winter time within they were cheerful and the surroundings as neat and comfortable as possible under the circumstances on november 24 1862 in a letter to his daughter mary he writes general burnsides whole army is apparently opposite fredericksburg and stretches from the rappahannock to the potomac what his intentions are he has not yet disclosed i am sorry he is in position to oppress our friends and citizens of the northern neck he threatens to bombard fredericksburg and the noble spirit displayed by its citizens particularly the women and children has elicited my highest admiration they have been abandoning their homes night and day during all this inclement weather cheerfully and uncomplainingly with only such assistance as our wagons and ambulances could afford women girls children trudging through the mud and bivouacking in the open fields how the battle of fredericksburg was fought and won all the world has heard and i shall not attempt to describe it on december 11th the day burnside commenced his attack general lee wrote to my mother the enemy after bombarding the town of fredericksburg setting fire to many houses and knocking down nearly all those along the river crossed over a large force about dark and now occupies the town we hold the hills commanding it and hope we shall be able to damage him yet his position and heavy guns command the town entirely on december 16th in another letter to my mother he tells of the recrossing of the federals i had supposed they were just preparing for battle and was saving our men for the conflict their hosts crown the hill and plain beyond the river and their numbers to me are unknown still i felt the confidence we could stand the shock and was anxious for the blow that is to fall on some point and was prepared to meet it here yesterday evening i had my suspicions that they might return during the night but could not believe they would relinquish their hopes after all their boasting and preparation and when i say that the latter is equal to the former you will have some idea of the magnitude this morning they were all safe on the north side of the rappahannock they went as they camein the night they suffered heavily as far as the battle went but it did not go far enough to satisfy me our loss was comparatively slight and i think will not exceed two thousand the contest will have now to be renewed but on what field i cannot say i did not see my father at any time during the fighting some days after it was all over i saw him as calm and composed as if nothing unusual had happened and he never referred to his great victory except to deplore the loss of his brave officers and soldiers or the sufferings of the sick and wounded he repeatedly referred to the hardships so bravely endured by the inhabitants of fredericksburg who had been obliged to flee from the town the women and children the old and the feeble whose sufferings cut him to the heart on christmas day he writes to his youngest daughter mildred who was at school in north carolina i cannot tell you how i long to see you when a little quiet occurs my thoughts revert to you your sisters and your mother my heart aches for our reunion your brothers i see occasionally this morning fitzhugh rode by with his young aidedecamp rob at the head of his brigade on his way up the rappahannock you must study hard gain knowledge and learn your duty to god and your neighbour that is the great object of life i have no news confined constantly to camp and my thoughts occupied with its necessities and duties i am however happy in the knowledge that general burnside and army will not eat their promised christmas dinner in richmond today on the next day he writes as follows to his daughter agnes who was with her mother in richmond camp fredericksburg december 26 1862 my precious little agnes i have not heard of you for a long time i wish you were with me for always solitary i am sometimes weary and long for the reunion of my family once again but i will not speak of myself but of you i have seen the ladies in this vicinity only when flying from the enemy and it caused me acute grief to witness their exposure and suffering but a more noble spirit was never displayed anywhere the faces of old and young were wreathed with smiles and glowed with happiness at their sacrifices for the good of their country many have lost everything what the fire and shells of the enemy spared their pillagers destroyed but god will shelter them i know so much heroism will not be unregarded i can only hold oral communication with your sister his daughter mary in king george county within the lines of the enemy and have forbidden the scouts to bring any writing and have taken some back that i had given them for her if caught it would compromise them they only convey messages i learn in that way she is well your devoted father r e lee i give another letter he wrote on christmas day besides the one quoted above to his daughter mildred it was written to his wife and is interesting as giving an insight into his private feelings and views regarding this great victory i will commence this holy day by writing to you my heart is filled with gratitude to almighty god for his unspeakable mercies with which he has blessed us in this day for those he has granted us from the beginning of life and particularly for those he has vouchsafed us during the past year what should have become of us without his crowning help and protection oh if our people would only recognise it and cease from vain selfboasting and adulation how strong would be my belief in final success and happiness to our country but what a cruel thing is war to separate and destroy families and friends and mar the purest joys and happiness god has granted us in this world to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbours and to devastate the fair face of this beautiful world i pray that on this day when only peace and goodwill are preached to mankind better thoughts may fill the hearts of our enemies and turn them to peace our army was never in such good health and condition since i have been attached to it i believe they share with me my disappointment that the enemy did not renew the combat on the 13th i was holding back all day and husbanding our strength and ammunition for the great struggle for which i thought i was preparing had i divined that was to have been his only effort he would have had more of it my heart bleeds at the death of every one of our gallant men one marked characteristic of my father was his habit of attending to all business matters promptly he was never idle and what he had to do he performed with care and precision mr custis my grandfather had made him executor of his will wherein it was directed that all the slaves belonging to the estate should be set free after the expiration of so many years the time had now arrived and notwithstanding the exacting duties of his position the care of his suffering soldiers and his anxiety about their future immediate and distant he proceeded according to the law of the land to carry out the provisions of the will and had delivered to every one of the servants where it was possible their manumission papers from his letters written at this time i give a few extracts bearing on this subject as regards the liberation of the people i wish to progress in it as far as i can those hired in richmond can still find employment there if they choose those in the country can do the same or remain on the farms i hope they will all do well and behave themselves i should like if i could to attend to their wants and see them placed to the best advantage but that is impossible all that choose can leave the state before the war closes i executed the deed of manumission sent me by mr caskie and returned it to him i perceived that john sawyer and jamess names among the arlington people had been omitted and inserted them i fear there are others among the white house lot which i did not discover as to the attacks of the northern papers i do not mind them and do not think it wise to make the publication you suggest if all the names of the people at arlington and on the pamunkey are not embraced in this deed i have executed i should like a supplementary deed to be drawn up containing all those omitted they are entitled to their freedom and i wish to give it to them those that have been carried away i hope are free and happy i cannot get their papers to them and they do not require them i will give them if they ever call for them it will be useless to ask their restitution to manumit them the generals sympathy for his suffering soldierschancellorsvilledeath of stonewall jacksongeneral fitzhugh lee wounded and capturedescape of his brother robertgettysburgreligious revivalinfantry reviewunsatisfactory commissariat during this winter which was a very severe one the sufferings of general lees soldiers on account of insufficient shelter and clothing the scant rations for man and beast the increasing destitution throughout the country and his inability to better these conditions bore heavily upon him but he was bright and cheerful to those around him never complaining of any one nor about anything and often indulging in his quaint humour especially with the younger officers as when he remarked to one of them who complained of the tough biscuit at breakfast you ought not to mind that they will stick by you the longer his headquarters continued all the winter at the same place and with stove and fireplaces in the tents the general and his military family managed to keep fairly comfortable on february 6 1863 he wrote to his daughter agnes from this camp camp fredericksburg february 6 1863 i read yesterday my precious daughter your letter and grieved very much when last in richmond at not seeing you my movements are so uncertain that i cannot be relied on for anything the only place i am to be found is in camp and i am so cross now that i am not worth seeing anywhere here you will have to take me with the three stoolsthe snow the rain and the mud the storm of the last twentyfour hours has added to our stock of all and we are now in a floating condition but the sun and the wind will carry all off in time and then we shall appreciate our relief our horses and mules suffer the most they have to bear the cold and rain tug through the mud and suffer all the time with hunger the roads are wretched almost impassable i heard of mag lately one of our scouts brought me a card of margaret stuarts with a pair of gauntlets directed to cousin robert i have no news general hooker is obliged to do something i do not know what it will be he is playing the chinese game trying what frightening will do he runs out his guns starts his wagons and troops up and down the river and creates an excitement generally our men look on in wonder give a cheer and all again subsides in statu quo ante bellum i wish you were here with me today you would have to sit by this little stove look out at the rain and keep yourself dry but here come in all the wet the adjutantsgeneral with the papers i must stop and go to work see how kind god is we have plenty to do in good weather and bad your devoted father r e lee on february 23d he writes to mrs lee camp fredericksburg february 23 1863 the weather is now very hard upon our poor bushmen this morning the whole country is covered with a mantle of snow fully a foot deep it was nearly up to my knees as i stepped out this morning and our poor horses were enveloped we have dug them out and opened our avenues a little but it will be terrible and the roads impassable no cars from richmond yesterday i fear our short rations for man and horse will have to be curtailed our enemies have their troubles too they are very strong immediately in front but have withdrawn their troops above and below us back toward acquia creek i owe mr f j hooker fighting joe was hookers most popular sobriquet in the federal army no thanks for keeping me here he ought to have made up his mind long ago about what do to24th the cars have arrived and brought me a young french officer full of vivacity and ardent for service with me i think the appearance of things will cool him if they do not the night will for he brought no blankets r e lee the dreary winter gradually passed away toward the last of april the two armies which had been opposite each other for four months began to move and about the first of may the greatest of lees battles was fought my command was on the extreme left and as hooker crossed the river we followed a raiding party of the enemys cavalry over toward the james river above richmond so i did not see my father at any time during the several days fighting the joy of our victory at chancellorsville was saddened by the death of stonewall jackson his loss was the heaviest blow the army of northern virginia ever sustained to jacksons note telling him he was wounded my father replied i cannot express my regret at the occurance could i have directed events i should have chosen for the good of the country to have been disabled in your stead i congratulate you on the victory which is due to your skill and energy jackson said when this was read to him better that ten jacksons should fall than one lee afterward when it was reported that jackson was doing well general lee playfully sent him word you are better off than i am for while you have only lost your left i have lost my right arm then hearing that he was worse he said tell him that i am praying for him as i believe i have never prayed for myself after his death general lee writes to my mother on may 11th in addition to the deaths of officers and friends consequent upon the late battles you will see that we have to mourn the loss of the great and good jackson any victory would be dear at such a price his remains go to richmond today i know not how to replace him gods will be done i trust he will raise up some one in his place jones in his memoirs says to one of his officers after jacksons death he general lee said i had such implicit confidence in jacksons skill and energy that i never troubled myself to give him detailed instructions the most general suggestions were all that he needed to one of his aides who came to his tent april 29th to inform him that the enemy had crossed the rappahannock river in heavy force general lee made the playful reply well i heard firing and i was beginning to think it was time some of you lazy young fellows were coming to tell me what it was all about say to general jackson that he knows just as well what to do with the enemy as i do jackson said of lee when it was intimated by some at the time he first took command that he was slow he is cautious he ought to be but he is not slow lee is a phenomenon he is the only man whom i would follow blindfold as the story of these great men year by year is made plainer to the world their love trust and respect for each other will be better understood as commander and lieutenant they were exactly suited when general lee wanted a movement made and gave jackson an outline of his plans and the object to be gained it was performed promptly well and thoroughly if it was possible for flesh and blood to do it at the end of may the army of northern virginia rested and strengthened was ready for active operations on may 31st general lee writes to mrs lee general hooker has been very daring this past week and quite active he has not said what he intends to do but is giving out by his movements that he designs crossing the rappahannock i hope we may be able to frustrate his plans in part if not in whole i pray that our merciful father in heaven may protect and direct us in that case i fear no odds and no numbers about june 5th most of the army was gathered around culpeper its efficiency confidence and morale were never better on june 7th the entire cavalry corps was reviewed on the plain near brandy station in culpeper by general lee we had been preparing ourselves for this event for some days cleaning mending and polishing and i remember were very proud of our appearance in fact it was a grand sightabout eight thousand wellmounted men riding by their beloved commander first passing by him in a walk and then a trot he writes to my mother next dayjune 8 1863 i reviewed the cavalry in this section yesterday it was a splendid sight the men and horses looked well they have recuperated since last fall stuart j e b stuart commanding cavalry corps was in all his glory your sons and nephews two sons and three nephews were well and flourishing the country here looks very green and pretty notwithstanding the ravages of war what a beautiful world god in his loving kindness to his creatures has given us what a shame that men endowed with reason and knowledge of right should mar his gifts the next day june 9th a large force of the enemys cavalry supported by infantry crossed the rappahannock and attacked general stuart the conflict lasted until dark when the enemy was compelled to recross the river with heavy loss leaving about five hundred prisoners three pieces of artillery and several colours in our hands during the engagement about 3 p m my brother general w h f lee my commanding officer was severely wounded in a letter dated the 11th of the month my father writes to my mother my supplications continue to ascend for you my children and my country when i last wrote i did not suppose that fitzhugh would be soon sent to the rear disabled and i hope it will be for a short time i saw him the night after the battleindeed met him on the field as they were bringing him from the front he is young and healthy and i trust will soon be up again he seemed to be more concerned about his brave men and officers who had fallen in the battle than about himself it was decided the next day to send my brother to hickory hill the home of mr w f wickham in hanover county about twenty miles from richmond and i was put in charge of him to take him there and to be with him until his wound should heal thus it happened that i did not meet my father again until after gettysburg had been fought and the army had recrossed into virginia almost to the same place i had left it my father wrote my brother a note the morning after he was wounded before he left culpeper it shows his consideration and tenderness my dear son i send you a dispatch received from c last night i hope you are comfortable this morning i wish i could see you but i cannot take care of yourself and make haste and get well and return though i scarcely ever saw you it was a great comfort to know that you were near and with me i could think of you and hope to see you may we yet meet in peace and happiness in a letter to my brothers wife written on the 11th his love and concern for both of them are plainly shown i am so grieved my dear daughter to send fitzhugh to you wounded but i am so grateful that his wound is of a character to give us full hope of a speedy recovery with his youth and strength to aid him and your tender care to nurse him i trust he will soon be well again i know that you will unite with me in thanks to almighty god who has so often sheltered him in the hour of danger for his recent deliverance and lift up your whole heart in praise to him for sparing a life so dear to us while enabling him to do his duty in the station in which he had placed him ask him to join us in supplication that he may always cover him with the shadow of his almighty arm and teach him that his only refuge is in him the greatness of whose mercy reacheth unto the heavens and his truth unto the clouds as some good is always mixed with the evil in this world you will now have him with you for a time and i shall look to you to cure him soon and send him back to me my brother reached hickory hill quite comfortably and his wound commenced to heal finely his wife joined him my mother and sisters came up from richmond and he had all the tender care he could wish he occupied the office in the yard while i slept in the room adjoining and became quite an expert nurse about two weeks after our arrival one lovely morning as we all came out from the breakfast table stepping into the front porch with mrs wickham we were much surprised to hear to or three shots down in the direction of the outer gate where there was a large grove of hickory trees mrs wickham said some one must be after her squirrels as there were many in those woods and she asked me to run down and stop whoever was shooting them i got my hat and at once started off to do her bidding i had not gone over a hundred yards toward the grove when i saw coming up at a gallop to the gate i was making for five or six federal cavalrymen i knew what it meant at once so i rushed back to the office and told my brother he immediately understood the situation and directed me to get awaysaid i could do no good by staying that the soldiers could not and would not hurt him and there was nothing to be gained by my falling into their hands but that on the contrary i might do a great deal of good by eluding them making my way to north wales a plantation across the pamunkey river and saving our horses so i ran out got over the fence and behind a thick hedge just as i heard the tramp and clank of quite a body of troopers riding up behind this hedge i crept along until i reached a body of woods were i was perfectly safe from a hill near by i ascertained that there was a large raiding party of federal cavalry in the main road and the heavy smoke ascending from the court house about three miles away told me that they were burning the railroad buildings at that place after waiting until i thought the coast was clear i worked my way very cautiously back to the vicinity of the house to find out what was going on fortunately i took advantage of the luxuriant shrubbery in the old garden at the rear of the house and when i looked out from the last box bush that screened me about twenty yards from the back porch i perceived that i was too soon for there were standing sitting and walking about quite a number of the bluecoats i jumped back behind the group of box trees and flinging myself flat under a thick fir crawled close up to the trunk under the lowhanging branches and lay there for some hours i saw my brother brought out from the office on a mattress and placed in the hickory hill carriage to which was hitched mr wichkams horses and then saw him driven away a soldier on the box and a mounted guard surrounding him he was carried to the white house in this way and then sent by water to fortress monroe this party had been sent out especially to capture him and he was held as a hostage for the safety of some federal officers we had captured for nine long weary months the next day i found out that all the horses but one had been saved by the faithfulness of our servants the one lost my brothers favourite and best horse was ridden straight into the column by scott a negro servant who had him out for exercise before he knew our enemies he and the horse were prisoners scott watched for his opportunity and not being guarded soon got away by crawling through a culvert under the road while the cavalry was passing along he made his way into a deep ditch in the adjoining field thence succeeded in reaching the farm where the rest of the horses were and hurried them off to a safe place in the woods just as the federal cavalry rode up to get them in a letter dated culpeper july 26th to my brothers wife my father thus urges resignation i received last night my darling daughter your letter of the 18th from hickory hill you must not be sick while fitzhugh is away or he will be more restless under his separation get strong and hearty by his return that he may the more rejoice at the sight of you i can appreciate your distress at fitzhughs situation i deeply sympathise with it and in the lone hours of the night i groan in sorrow at his captivity and separation from you but we must bear it exercise all our patience and do nothing to aggravate the evil this besides injuring ourselves would rejoice our enemies and be sinful in the eyes of god in his own good time he will relieve us and make all things work together for our good if we give him our love and place in him our trust i can see no harm that can result from fitzhughs capture except his detention i feel assured that he will be well attended to he will be in the hands of old army officers and surgeons most of whom are men of principle and humanity his wound i understand has not been injured by his removal but is doing well nothing would do him more harm than for him to learn that you were sick and sad how could he get well so cheer up and prove your fortitude and patriotism you may think of fitzhugh and love him as much as you please but do not grieve over him or grow sad from williamsport to my mother he thus writes of his sons capture i have heard with great grief that fitzhugh has been captured by the enemy had not expected that he would be taken from his bed and carried off but we must bear this additional affliction with fortitude and resignation and not repine at the will of god it will eventuate in some good that we know not of now we must bear our labours and hardships manfully our noble men are cheerful and confident i constantly remember you in my thoughts and prayers on july 12th from near hagerstown he writes again about him the consequences of war are horrid enough at best surrounded by all the ameliorations of civilisation and christianity i am very sorry for the injuries done the family at hickory hill and particularly that our dear old uncle williams in his eightieth year should be subjected to such treatment but we cannot help it and must endure it you will however learn before this reaches you that our success at gettysburg was not so great as reportedin fact that we failed to drive the enemy from his position and that our army withdrew to the potomac had the river not unexpectedly risen all would have been well with us but god in his allwise providence willed otherwise and our communications have been interrupted and almost cut off the waters have subsided to about four feet and if they continue by tomorrow i hope our communications will be open i trust that a merciful god our only hope and refuge will not desert us in this hour of need and will deliver us by his almighty hand that the whole world may recognise his power and all hearts be lifted up in adoration and praise of his unbounded lovingkindness we must however submit to his almighty will whatever that may be may god guide and protect us all is my constant prayer in 1868 in a letter to major wm m mcdonald of berryville clarke county virginia who was intending to write a school history and had written to my father asking for information about some of his great battles the following statement appears as to the battle of gettysburg i must again refer you to the official accounts its loss was occasioned by a combination of circumstances it was commenced in the absence of correct intelligence it was continued in the effort to overcome the difficulties by which we were surrounded and it would have been gained could one determined and united blow have been delivered by our whole line as it was victory trembled in the balance for three days and the battle resulted in the infliction of as great an amount of injury as was received and in frustrating the federal campaign for the season after my brothers capture i went to richmond taking with me his horses and servants after remaining there a short time i mounted my mare and started back to the army which i found at its old campingground in culpeper i stopped at first for a few days with my father he was very glad to see me and the could tell him all about my mother and sisters and many other friends whom i had just left in richmond he appeared to be unchanged in manner and appearance the disappointment in the gettysburg campaign to which he alludes in his letter to my mother was not shown in anything he said or did he was calm and dignified with all at times bright and cheerful and always had a pleasant word for those about him the army lay inactive along the line of the rappahannock and the rapidan for two months watching the enemy who was in our front we were very anxious to attack or to be attacked but each general desired to fight on ground of his won choosing during this period and indeed at all times my father was fully employed besides the care of his own immediate command he advised with the president and secretary of war as to the movements and dispositions of the other armies in the confederacy in looking over his correspondence one is astonished a the amount of it and at its varied character he always answered all letters addressed to him from whatever source if it was possible during this winter he devoted himself especially to looking after the welfare of his troops their clothing shoes and rations all three of which were becoming very scarce often indeed his army had only a few days rations in sight here are some letters written to the authorities showing how he was hampered in his movements by the deficiencies existing in the quartermasters and commissary departments to the quartermastergeneral at richmond he writes october 1863 after his movement around general meades right to manassas the want of supplies of shoes clothing and blankets is very great nothing but my unwillingness to expose the men to the hardships that would have resulted from moving them into loudoun in their present condition induced me to return to the rappahannock but i was averse to marching them over the rough roads of that region at a season too when frosts are certain and snow probable unless they were better provided to encounter them without suffering i should otherwise have endeavoured to detain general meade near the potomac if i could not throw him to the north side in a letter of the same time to the honourable james a seddon secretary of war if general meade is disposed to remain quiet where he is it was my intention provided the army could be supplied with clothing again to advance and threaten his position nothing prevented my continuing in his front but the destitute condition of the men thousands of whom are barefooted a greater number partially shod and nearly all without overcoats blankets or warm clothing i think the sublimest sight of war was the cheerfulness and alacrity exhibited by this army in the pursuit of the enemy under all the trial and privations to which it was exposed later on in january when the sever weather commenced he again writes to the quartermastergeneral on the same subject general the want of shoes and blankets in this army continues to cause much suffering and to impair its efficiency in one regiment i am informed that there are only fifty men with serviceable shoes and a brigade that recently went on picket was compelled to leave several hundred men in camp who were unable to bear the exposure of duty being destitute of shoes and blankets the supply by running the blockade has become so precarious that i think we should turn our attention chiefly to our own resources and i should like to be informed how far the latter can be counted upon i trust that no efforts will be spared to develop our own resources of supply as a further dependence upon those from abroad can result in nothing but increase of suffering and want i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee general there was at this time a great revival of religion in the army my father became much interested in it and did what he could to promote in his camps all sacred exercises reverend j w jones in his personal reminiscences of general r e lee says general lees orders and reports always gratefully recognised the lord of hosts as the giver of victory and expressed an humble dependence upon and trust in him all his correspondence shows the same devout feeling on august 13 1863 he issued the following order headquarters army northern virginia august 13 1863 the president of the confederate states has in the name of the people appointed august 21st as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer a strict observance of the day is enjoined upon the officers and soldiers of this army all military duties except such as are absolutely necessary will be suspended the commanding officers of brigades and regiments are requested to cause divine services suitable to the occasion to be performed in their respective commands soldiers we have sinned against almighty god we have forgotten his signal mercies and have cultivated a revengeful haughty and boastful spirit we have not remembered that the defenders of a just cause should be pure in his eyes that our times are in his hands and we have relied too much on our own arms for the achievement of our independence god is our only refuge and our strength let us humble ourselves before him let us confess our many sins and beseech him to give us a higher courage a purer patriotism and more determined will that he will hasten the time when war with its sorrows and sufferings shall cease and that he will give us a name and place among the nations of the earth r e lee general his was a practical everyday religion which supported him all through his life enabled him to bear with equanimity every reverse of fortune and to accept her gifts without undue elation during this period of rest so unusual to the army of northern virginia several reviews were held before the commanding general i remember being present when that of the third army corps general a p hill commanding took place some of us young cavalrymen then stationed near the rappahannock rode over to orange court house to see this grand military pageant from all parts of the army officers and men who could get leave came to look on and from all the surrounding country the people old and young ladies and children came in every pattern of vehicle and on horseback to see twenty thousand of that incomparable infantry of the army of northern virginia pass in review before their great commander the general was mounted on traveller looking very proud of his master who had on sash and sword which he very rarely wore a pair of new cavalry gauntlets and i think a new hat at any rate he looked unusually fine and sat his horse like a perfect picture of grace and power the infantry was drawn up in column by divisions with their bright muskets all glittering in the sun their battleflags standing straight out before the breeze and their bands playing awaiting the inspection of the general before they broke into column by companies and marched past him in review when all was ready general hill and staff rode up to general lee and the two generals with their respective staffs galloped around front and rear of each of the three divisions standing motionless on the plain as the cavalcade reached the head of each division its commanding officer joined in and followed as far as the next division so that there was a continual infusion of fresh groups into the original one all along the lines traveller started with a long lope and never changed his stride his rider sat erect and calm not noticing anything but the gray lines of men whom he knew so well the pace was very fast as there were nine good miles to go and the escort began to become less and less dropping out one by one from different causes as traveller raced along without check when the general drew up after this ninemile gallop under the standard at the reviewingstand flushed with the exercise as well as with pride in his brave men he raised his hat and saluted then arose a shout of applause and admiration from the entire assemblage the memory of which to this day moistens the eye of every old soldier the corps was then passed in review at a quickstep company front it was a most imposing sight after it was all over my father rode up to several carriages whose occupants he knew and gladdened them by a smile a word or a shake of the hand he found several of us young officers with some pretty cousins of his from richmond and he was very bright and cheerful joking us young people about each other his letters to my mother and sister this summer and fall help to give an insight into his thoughts and feelings on july 15th from bunker hill in a letter to his wife he says the army has returned to virginia its return is rather sooner than i had originally contemplated but having accomplished much of what i proposed on leaving the rappahannocknamely relieving the valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his army north of the potomaci determined to recross the latter river the enemy after centering his forces in our front began to fortify himself in his position and bring up his troops militia etcand those around washington and alexandria this gave him enormous odds it also circumscribed our limits for procuring subsistence for men and animals which with the uncertain state of the river rendered it hazardous for us to continue on the north side it has been raining a great deal since we first crossed the potomac making the roads horrid and embarrassing our operations the night we recrossed it rained terribly yet we got all over safe save such vehicles as broke down on the road from the mud rocks etc we are all well i hope we will yet be able to damage our adversaries when they meet us that it should be so we must implore the forgiveness of god for our sins and the continuance of his blessings there is nothing but his almighty power that can sustain us god bless you all later july 26th he writes from camp culpeper after crossing the potomac finding that the shenandoah was six feet above the fordingstage and having waited for a week for it to fall so that i might cross into loudoun fearing that the enemy might take advantage of our position and move upon richmond i determined to ascend the valley and cross into culpeper two corps are here with me the third passed thorntons gap and i hope will be in striking distance tomorrow the army has laboured hard endured much and behaved nobly it has accomplished all that could be reasonably expected it ought not to have been expected to perform impossibilities or to have fulfilled the anticipations of the thoughtless and unreasonable on august 2d from the same camp he again writes to my mother i have heard of some doctor having reached richmond who had seen our son at fortress monroe he said that his wound is improving and that he himself was well and walking about on crutches the exchange of prisoners that had been going on has for some cause been suspended owing to some crotchet or other but i hope will soon be resumed and that we shall have him back soon the armies are in such close proximity that frequent collisions are common along the outposts yesterday the enemy laid down two or three pontoon bridges across the rappahannock and crossed his cavalry with a big force of his infantry it looked at first as if it were the advance of his army and as i had not intended to deliver battle i directed our cavalry to retire slowly before them and to check their too rapid pursuit finding later in the day that their army was not following i ordered out the infantry and drove them back to the river i suppose they intended to push on to richmond by this or some other route i trust however they will never reach there on august 23d from the camp near orange court house general lee writes to mrs lee my camp is near mr erasmus taylors house who has been very kind in contributing to our comfort his wife sends us every day buttermilk loaf bread ice and such vegetables as she has i cannot get her to desist thought i have made two special visits to that effect all the brides have come on a visit to the army mrs ewell mrs walker mrs heth etc general meades army is north of the rappahannock along the orange and alexandria railroad he is very quiet september 4 1863 you see i am still here when i wrote last the indications were that the enemy would move against us any day but this past week he has been very quiet and seems at present to continue so i was out looking at him yesterday from clarkes mountain he has spread himself over a large surface and looks immense and on september 18th from the same camp the enemy state that they have heard of a great reduction in our forces here and are now going to drive us back to richmond i trust they will not succeed but our hope and our refuge is in our merciful father in heaven on october 9th the army of northern virginia was put in motion and wa pushed around meades right meade was gradually forced back to a position near the old battlefield at manassas although we had hard marching much skirmishing and several severe fights between the cavalry of both armies nothing permanent was accomplished and in about ten days we were back on our old lines in a letter of october 19 1863 to his wife my father says i have returned to the rappahannock i did not pursue with the main army beyond bristoe or broad run our advance went as far as bull run where the enemy was entrenched extending his right as far as chantilly in the yard of which he was building a redoubt i could have thrown him farther back but saw no chance of bringing him to battle and it would only have served to fatigue our troops by advancing farther i should certainly have endeavored to throw them north of the potomac but thousands were barefooted thousands with fragments of shoes and all without overcoats blankets or warm clothing i could not bear to expose them to certain suffering and an uncertain issue on october 25th from camp rappahannock he writes again to my mother i moved yesterday into a nice pine thicket and perry is today engaged in constructing a chimney in front of my tent which will make it warm and comfortable i have no idea when fitzhugh his son major general fitzhugh lee will be exchanged the federal authorities still resist all exchanges because they think it is to our interest to make them any desire expressed on our part for the exchange of any individual magnifies the difficulty as they at once think some great benefit is to result to us from it his detention is very grievous to me and besides i want his services i am glad you have some socks for the army send them to me they will come safely tell the girls his daughters to send all they can i wish they could make some shoes too we have thousands of barefooted men there is no news general meade i believe is repairing the railroad and i presume will come on again if i could only get some shoes and clothes for the men i would save him the trouble one can see from these letters of my father how deeply he felt for the sufferings of his soldiers and how his plans were hindered by inadequate supplies of food and clothing i heard him constantly allude to these troubles indeed they seemed never absent from his mind the lee family in richmondthe generals letters to them from camps rappahannock and rapidandeath of mrs fitzhugh leepreparations to meet general grantthe wildernessspottsylvania court housedeath of general stuartgeneral lees illness my mother had quite recently rented a house on clay street in richmond which though small gave her a roof of her own and it also enabled her at times to entertain some of her many friends of this new home and of a visit of a soldiers wife to him the general thus writes camp rappahannock november 1 1863 i received yesterday dear mary your letter of the 29th and am very glad to learn that you find your new abode so comfortable and so well arranged the only fault i find in it is that it is not large enough for you all and that charlotte whom i fear requires much attention is by herself where is life to go too for i suppose she is a very big personage but you have never told me where it is situated or how i am to direct to you perhaps that may be the cause of delay in my letters i am sorry you find such difficulty in procuring yarn for socks etc i fear my daughters have not taken to the spinningwheel and loom as i have recommended i shall not be able to recommend them to the brave soldiers for wives i had a visit from a soldiers wife today who was on a visit with her husband she was from abbeville district s c said she had not seen her husband for more than two years and as he had written to her for clothes she herself thought she would bring them on it was the first time she had travelled by railroad but she got along very well by herself she brought an entire suit of her own manufacture for her husband she spun the yarn and made the clothes herself she clad her three young children in the same way and had on a beautiful pair of gloves she had made for herself her children she had left with her sister she said she had been here a week and must return tomorrow and thought she could not go back without seeing me her husband accompanied her to my tent in his nice gray suit she was very pleasing in her address and modest in her manner and was clad in a nice new alpaca i am certain she could not have made that ask misses agnes and sally warwick what they think of that they need not ask me for permission to get married until they can do likewise she in fact was an admirable woman said she was willing to give up everything she had in the world to attain our independence and the only complaint she made of the conduct of our enemies was their arming our servants against us her greatest difficulty was to procure shoes she made them for herself and children of cloth with leather soles she sat with me about ten minutes and took her leaveanother mark of senseand made no request for herself or husband i wrote you about my wants in my former letter my rheumatism i hope is a little better but i have had today and indeed always have much pain i trust it will pass away i have just had a visit from my nephews fitz john and henry general fitz lee and his two brothers major john mason lee and captain henry carter lee the former is now on a little expedition the latter accompanies him as soon as i was left alone i committed them in a fervent prayer to the care and guidance of our heavenly father i pray you may be made whole and happy truly and devotedly yours r e lee another letter from the same camp is interesting camp rappahannock november 5 1863 i received last night dear mary your letter of the 2d i am glad to hear that charlotte is better i hope that she will get strong and well poor child the visit of her grandpa will cheer her up i trust and i know he gave her plenty of good advice tell mrs atkinson that her son nelson is a very good scout and a good soldier i wish i had some way of promoting him i received the bucket of butter she was so kind as to send me but have had no opportunity of returning the vessel which i hope to be able to do i am sorry smith does not like your house i have told you my only objection to it and wish it were large enough to hold charlotte it must have reminded you of old times to have your brother carter and uncle williams mr charles carter lee the generals brother mr williams carter the generals uncle to see you i think my rheumatism is better today i have been through a great deal with comparatively little suffering i have been wanting to review the cavalry for some time and appointed today with fear and trembling i had not been on horseback for five days previously and feared i should not get through the governor was here and told me mrs letcher had seen you recently i saw all my nephews looking very handsome and rob too the latter says he has written to you three times since he crossed the river tell chas i think fs old regiment the 9th made the best appearance in review while on the ground a man rode up to me and said he was just from alexandria and had been requested to give me a box which he handed me but did not know who sent it it contained a handsome pair of gilt spurs goodnight may a kind heavenly father guard you all truly and affectionately r e lee when our cavalry was reviewed the preceding summer it happened that we engaged the next day june 9th the enemys entire force of that arm in the famous battle of brandy station since then there had been a sort of superstition amongst us that if we wanted a fight all that was necessary was to have a review we were now on the same ground we had occupied in june and the enemy was in force just across the river as it happened the fighting did take place though the cavalry was not alone engaged not the day after the review but on november 7th meade advanced and crossed the rappahannock while our army fell back and took up our position on the line of the rapidan before the two armies settled down into winter quarters general meade tried once more to get at us and on the 26th of november with ten days rations and in light marching order he crossed the rapidan and attempted to turn our right but he was unable to do anything being met at every point by the army of northern virginia heavily entrenched and anxious for an attack long says meade declared that the position could not be carried without the loss of thirty thousand men this contingency was too terrible to be entertainedyet the rations of the men were nearly exhausted and nothing remained but retreat this was safely accomplished on the night of december 1st lee was more surprised at the retreat of meade than he had been at his advance and his men who had been in high spirits at the prospect of obliterating the memory of gettysburg were sadly disappointed at the loss of the opportunity to my mother general lee wrote on december 4th from camp rapidan you will probably have seen that general meade has retired to his old position on the rappahannock without giving us battle i had expected from his movements and all that i had heard that it was his intention to do so and after the first day when i thought it necessary to skirmish pretty sharply with him on both flanks to ascertain his views i waited patiently his attack on tuesday however i thought he had changed his mind and that night made preparations to move around his left next morning and attack him but when day dawned he was nowhere to be seen he had commenced to withdraw at dark tuesday evening we pursued to the rapidan but he was over owing to the nature of the ground it was to our advantage to receive rather than to make the attack i am greatly disappointed at his getting off with so little damage but we do not know what is best for us i believe a kind god has ordered all things for our good about this time the people of the city of richmond to show their esteem for my father desired to present him with a home general lee on hearing of it thus wrote to the president of the council i assure you sir that no want of appreciation of the honour conferred upon me by this resolutionor insensibility to the kind feelings which prompted itinduces me to ask as i most respectfully do that no further proceedings be taken with reference to the subject the house is not necessary for the use of my family and my own duties will prevent my residence in richmond i should therefore be compelled to decline the generous offer and i trust that whatever means the city council may have to spare for this purpose may be devoted to the relief of the families of our soldiers in the field who are more in want of assistance and more deserving it than myself my brother was still in prison and his detention gave my father great concern in a letter to my mother written november 21st he says i see by the papers that our son has been sent to fort lafayette any place would be better than fort monroe with butler in command his long confinement is very grievous to me yet it may all turn out for the best to his daughterinlaw my father was devoutedly attached his love for her was like that for his own children and when her husband was captured and thrown wounded into prison his great tenderness for her was shown on all occasions her death about this time though expected was a great blow to him when news came to gen w h f lee at fortress monroe that his wife charlotte was dying in richmond he made application to general butler commanding that post that he be allowed to go to her for 48 hours his brother custis lee of equal rank with himself having formally volunteered in writing to take his place as a hostage was curtly and peremptorily refused in his letter to my mother of december 27th my father says custiss despatch which i received last night demolished all the hopes in which i had been indulging during the day of dear charlottes recovery it has pleased god to take from us one exceedingly dear to us and we must be resigned to his holy will she i trust will enjoy peace and happiness forever while we must patiently struggle on under all the ills that may be in store for us what a glorious thought it is that she has joined her little cherubs and our angel annie his second daughter in heaven thus is link by link the strong chain broken that binds us to the earth and our passage soothed to another world oh that we may be at last united in that heaven of rest where trouble and sorrow never enter to join in an everlasting chorus of praise and glory to our lord and saviour i grieve for our lost darling as a father only can grieve for a daughter and my sorrow is heightened by the thought of the anguish her death will cause our dear son and the poignancy it will give to the bars of his prison may god in his mercy enable him to bear the blow he has so suddenly dealt and sanctify it to his everlasting happiness after meades last move the weather becoming wintry the troops fixed up for themselves winter quarters and the cavalry and artillery were sent back along the line of the chesapeake ohio railroad where forage could be more easily obtained for their horses on january 24 1864 the general writes to my mother i have had to disperse the cavalry as much as possible to obtain forage for their horses and it is that which causes trouble provisions for the men too are very scarce and with very light diet and light clothing i fear they suffer but still they are cheerful and uncomplaining i received a report from one division the other day in which it stated that over four hundred men were barefooted and over a thousand without blankets lee was the idol of his men colonel charles marshall who was his a d c and military secretary illustrates this well in the following incident while the army was on the rapidan in the winter of 18634 it became necessary as was often the case to put the men on very short rations their duty was hard not only on the outposts during the winter but in the construction of roads to facilitate communication between the different parts of the army one day general lee received a letter from a private soldier whose name i do not now remember informing him of the work that he had to do and stating that his rations were not sufficient to enable him to undergo the fatigue he said however that if it was absolutely necessary to put him on such short allowance he would make the best of it but that he and his comrades wanted to know if general lee was aware that his men were getting so little to eat because if he was aware of it he was sure there must be some necessity for it general lee did not reply directly to the letter but issued a general order in which he informed the soldiers of his efforts in their behalf and that their privation was beyond his means of present relief but assured them that he was making every effort to procure sufficient supplies after that there was not a murmur in the army and the hungry men went cheerfully to their hard work when i returned to the army in the summer i reported to my old brigade which was gallantly commanded by john r chambliss colonel of the 13th virginia cavalry the senior officer of the brigade later i had been assigned to duty with general fitz lee and was with him at this time my mother was anxious that i should be with my father thinking i have no doubt that my continued presence would be a comfort to him she must have written him to that effect for in a letter to her dated february 1864 he says in reference to rob his company would be a great pleasure and comfort to me and he would be extremely useful in various ways but i am opposed to officers surrounding themselves with their sons and relatives it is wrong in principle and in that case selections would be made from private and social relations rather than for the public good there is the same objection to his going with fitz lee i should prefer robs being in the line in an independent position where he could rise by his own merit and not through the recommendation of his relatives i expect him soon when i can better see what he himself thinks the young men have no fondness for the society of the old general he is too heavy and sombre for them if anything was said to me on this occasion by my father i do not remember it i rather think that something prevented the interview for i cannot believe that it could have entirely escaped my memory at any rate i remained with general fitz lee until my brothers return from prison in april of that year fitz lees brigade camped near charlottesville on the chesapeake ohio railroad in january in order that forage could be more readily obtained the officers to amuse themselves and to return in part the courtesies and kindnesses of the ladies of the town gave a ball it was a grand affair for those times committees were appointed and printed invitations issued as a member of the invitation committee i sent one to the general commanding the army here is his opinion of it in a letter to me i inclose a letter for you which has been sent to my care i hope you are well and all around you are so tell fitz i grieve over the hardships and sufferings of his men in their late expedition i should have preferred his waiting for more favourable weather he accomplished much under the circumstances but would have done more in better weather i am afraid he was anxious to get back to the ball this is a bad time for such things we have too grave subjects on hand to engage in such trivial amusements i would rather his officers should entertain themselves in fattening their horses healing their men and recruiting their regiments there are too many lees on the committee i like all to be present at the battles but can excuse them at balls but the saying is children will be children i think he had better move his camp farther from charlottesville and perhaps he will get more work and less play he and i are too old for such assemblies i want him to write me how his men are his horses and what i can do to full up the ranks in this winter and spring of 1864 every exertion possible was made by my father to increase the strength of his army and to improve its efficiency he knew full well that the enemy was getting together an enormous force and that his vast resources would be put forth to crush us in the spring his letters at this time to president davis and the secretary of war show how well he understood the difficulties of his position in none of them general long says does he show a symptom of despair or breathe a thought of giving up the contest to the last he remained full of resources energetic and defiant and ready to bear upon his shoulders the whole burden of the conduct of the war in a letter to president davis written march 1864 he says mr president since my former letter on the subject the indications that operations in virginia will be vigorously prosecuted by the enemy are stronger than they then were general grant has returned from the army in the west he is at present with the army of the potomac which is being organised and recruited every train brings recruits and it is stated that every available regiment at the north is added to it their plans are not sufficiently developed to discover them but i think we can assume that if general grant is to direct operations on this frontier he will concentrate a large force on one or more lines and prudence dictates that we should make such preparations as are in our power on april 6th he again writes to the president all the information i receive tends to show that the great effort of the enemy in this campaign will be made in virginia reinforcements are certainly daily arriving to the army of the potomac the tone of the northern papers as well as the impression prevailing in their armies go to show that grant with a large force is to move against richmond the movements and reports of the enemy may be intended to mislead us and should therefore be carefully observed but all the information that reaches me goes to strengthen the belief that general grant is preparing to move against richmond the question of feeding his army was ever before him to see his men hungry and cold and his horses ill fed was a great pain to him to mr davis he thus writes on this subject headquarters april 12 1864 mr president my anxiety on the subject of provisions for the army is so great that i cannot refrain from expressing it to your excellency i cannot see how we can operate with our present supplies any derangement in their arrival or disaster to the railroad would render it impossible for me to keep the army together and might force a retreat to north carolina there is nothing to be had in this section for men or animals we have rations for the troops today and tomorrow i hope a new supply arrived last night but i have not yet had a report every exertion should be made to supply the depots at richmond and at other points all pleasure travel should cease and everything be devoted to necessary wants i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee general in a letter written to our cousin margaret stuart of whom he was very fond dated march 29th he says the indications at present are that we shall have a hard struggle general grant is with the army of the potomac all the officers wives sick etc have been sent to washington no ingress into or egress from the lines is now permitted and no papers are allowed to come outthey claim to be assembling a large force again april 28th he writes to this same young cousin i dislike to send letters within reach of the enemy as they might serve if captured to bring distress on others but you must sometimes cast your thoughts on the army of northern virginia and never forget it in your prayers it is preparing for a great struggle but i pray and trust that the great god mighty to deliver will spread over it his almighty arms and drive its enemies before it one perceives from these letters how clearly my father foresaw the storm that was so soon to burst upon him he used every means within his power to increase and strengthen his army to meet it and he continually urged the authorities at richmond to make preparations in the way of supplies of ammunition rations and clothing i shall not attempt to describe any part of this campaign except in a very general way it has been well written up by both sides and what was done by the army of northern virginia we all know i saw my father only once or twice to speak to him during the thirty odd days from the wilderness to petersburg but in common with all his soldiers i felt that he was ever near that he could be entirely trusted with the care of us that he would not fail us that it would all end well the feeling of trust that we had in him was simply sublime when i say we i mean the men of my age and standing officers and privates alike older heads may have begun to see the beginning of the end when they saw that slaughter and defeat did not deter our enemy but made him the more determined in his hammering process but it never occurred to me and to thousands and thousands like me that there was any occasion for uneasiness we firmly believed that marse robert as his soldiers lovingly called him would bring us out of this trouble all right when grant reached spottsylvania court house he sent all of his cavalry under sheridan to break our communications they were met at yellow tavern six miles from richmond by general stuart with three brigades of confederate cavalry and were attacked so fiercely that they were held there nearly all day giving time for the troops around richmond to concentrate for the defense of the city in this fight general stuart fell mortally wounded and he died the next day in richmond the death of our noted cavalry leader was a great blow to our causea loss second only to that of jackson captain w gordon mccabe writes me i was sitting on my horse very near to general lee who was talking to my colonel william johnson pegram when a courier galloped up with the despatch announcing that stuart had been mortally wounded and was dying general lee was evidently greatly affected and said slowly as he folded up the despatch general stuart has been mortally wounded a most valuable and able officer then after a moment he added in a voice of deep feeling he never brought me a piece of false informationturned and looked away what praise dearer to a soldiers heart could fall from the lips of the commanding general touching his chief of cavalry these simple words of lee constitute i think the fittest inscription for the monument that is soon to be erected to the memory of the great cavalry leader of the army of northern virginia in a letter from my father to my mother dated spottsylvania court house may 16th he says as i write i am expecting the sound of the guns every moment i grieve over the loss of our gallant officers and men and miss their aid and sympathy a more zealous ardent brave and devoted soldier than stuart the confederacy cannot have praise be to god for having sustained us so far i have thought of you very often in these eventful days god bless and preserve you general lee in his order announcing the death of stuart thus speaks of him among the gallant soldiers who have fallen in this war general stuart was second to none in valour in zeal and in unflinching devotion to his country his achievements form a conspicuous part of the history of this army with which his name and services will be forever associated to military capacity of a high order and to the noble virtues of the soldier he added the brighter graces of a pure life guided and sustained by the christians faith and hope the mysterious hand of an allwise god has removed him from the scene of his usefulness and fame his grateful countrymen will mourn his loss and cherish his memory to his comrades in arms he has left the proud recollections of his deeds and the inspiring influence of his example speaking of the operations around spottsylvania court house swinton the historian of the army of the potomac says before the lines of spottsylvania the army of the potomac had for twelve days and nights engaged in a fierce wrestle in which it had done all that valour may do to carry a position by nature and art impregnable in this contest unparalleled in its continuous fury and swelling to the proportions of a campaign language is inadequate to convey an impression of the labours fatigues and sufferings of the troops who fought by day only to march by night from point to point of the long line and renew the fight on the morrow above forty thousand men had already fallen in the bloody encounters of the wilderness and spottsylvania and the exhausted army began to lose its spirits it was with joy therefore that it at length turned its back upon the lines of spottsylvania general long in his memoirs of general lee speaking of our army at this time says in no previous operations did the army of northern virginia display higher soldierly qualities regardless of numbers every breach was filled and with unparalleled stubbornness its lines were maintained the soldiers of that army not only gratified their countrymen but by their gallantry and vigour won the admiration of their enemies whenever the men in blue appeared they were met by those in gray and muzzle to muzzle and point to point they measured their foemans strength when we learned that general lee was illconfined for a day or two to his tent at the time he was confronting general grant on the north annathis terrible thought forced itself upon us suppose disease should disable him even for a time or worse should take him forever from the front of his men it could not be it was too awful to consider and we banished any such possibility from our minds when we saw him out again on the lines riding traveller as usual it was as if some great crushing weight had been suddenly lifted from our hearts colonel walter h taylor his adjutantgeneral says the indisposition of general leewas more serious than was generally supposed those near him were very apprehensive lest he should be compelled to give up general early also writes of this circumstance one of his three corps commanders longstreet had been disabled by wounds at the wilderness and another was too unwell to command his corps a p hill while he general lee was suffering from a most annoying and weakening disease in fact nothing but his own determined will enabled him to keep the field at all and it was then rendered more manifest than ever that he was the head and front the very life and soul of the army battle of cold harboursiege of petersburgthe general intrusts a mission to his son robertbattle of the cratergrant crosses the james rivergeneral longs penpicture of leeknitting socks for the soldiersa christmas dinnerincidents of camp life from the north anna river the federal army moved by its left flank seeking to find its adversary unprepared but the army of northern virginia steadily confronted it ever ready to receive any attack at cold harbour they paused facing each other and general grant having received sixteen thousand men from butler by way of yorktown on june 1st made an attack but found our lines immovable in his memoirs he writes june 2d was spent in getting troops into position for attack on the 3d on june 3d we again assaulted the enemys works in the hope of driving him from his position in this attempt our loss was heavy while that of the enemy i have reason to believe was comparatively light this assault was repelled along the whole line with the most terrible slaughter yet recorded in our war yet in a few hours these beaten men were ordered to move up to our lines again swinton the historian of the army of the potomac thus describes what happened when this order was sent to the men the order was issued through these officers the corps commanders to their subordinate commanders and from them descended through the wonted channels but no man stirred and the immobile lines pronounced a verdict silent yet emphatic against further slaughter the loss on the union side in this sanguinary action was more than thirteen thousand while on the part of the confederates it is doubtful whether it reached that many hundreds colonel walter h taylor in his four years with general lee says soon after this he grant abandoned his chosen line of operations and moved his army to the south side of the james river the struggle from wilderness to this point covers a period of about one month during which time there had been an almost daily encounter of hostile arms and the army of northern virginia had placed hors de combat of the army under general grant a number equal to its entire numerical strength at the commencement of the campaign and notwithstanding its own heavy losses and the reinforcements received by the enemy still presented an impregnable front to its opponent and constituted and insuperable barrier to general grants on to richmond thus after thirty days of marching starving fighting and with a loss of more than sixty thousand men general grant reached the james river near petersburg which he could have done at any time he so desired without the loss of a single man the baffling of our determined foe so successfully raised the spirits of our rank and file and their confidence in their commander knew no bounds the two armies now commenced a contest which could end only one way if general lee had been permitted to evacuate petersburg and richmond to fall back upon some interior point nearer supplies for man and beast and within supporting distance of the remaining forces of the confederacy the surrender would certainly have been put offpossibly never have taken placeand the result of the war changed the army of the potomac placed itself on the james through whose channel it had easy access to the wide world whence to secure for itself an unlimited supply of men and munitions of war general lee with a line thirty miles long to defend and with only 35000 men to hold it with no chance of reinforcements no reserves with which to fill up the ranks lessened daily by death in battle and by disease had to sit still and see his army on half rations or less melt away because it was deemed advisable by his government for political and other purposes to hold richmond the confederacys capital in an article by lord wolseley in macmillans magazine he says lee was opposed to the final defense of richmond that was urged upon him for political not military reasons it was a great strategic error general grants large army of men was easily fed and its daily losses easily recruited from a near base whereas if it had been drawn into the interior after the little army with which lee endeavoured to protect richmond its fighting strength would have been largely reduced by the detachments required to guard a long line of communications through a hostile country during the nine months the siege of petersburg lasted i saw my father but seldom his headquarters were near the town my command was on the extreme right of the army and during the winter in order to get forage we were moved still further away close to the border of north carolina during this summer i had occasion once or twice to report to him at his headquarters once about july 1st by his special order i remember how we all racked our brains to account for this order which was for me to report at once to the commanding general and many wild guesses were made by my young companions as to what was to become of me their surmises extended from my being shot for unlawful foraging to my being sent on a mission abroad to solicit the recognition of our independence i reported at once and found my father expecting me with a bed prepared it was characteristic of him that he never said a word about what i was wanted for until he was ready with full instructions i was fed at once for i was still hungry my bed was shown me and i was told to rest and sleep well as he wanted me in the morning and that i would need all my strength the next morning he gave me a letter to general early who with his command was at that time in maryland threatening washington my mission was to carry this letter to him as early had cut loose from his communications with virginia and as there was a chance of any messenger being caught by raiding parties my father gave me verbally the contents of his letter and told me that if i saw any chance of my capture to destroy it then if i did reach the general i should be able to tell him what he had written he cautioned me to keep my own counsel and to say nothing to any one as to my destination orders for a relay of horses from staunton where the railroad terminated to the potomac had been telegraphed and i was to start at once this i did seeing my sisters and mother in richmond while waiting for the train to staunton and having very great difficulty in keeping from them my destination but i did and riding night and day came up with general early at a point in maryland some miles beyond the old battlefield of sharpsburg i delivered the letter to him returned to petersburg and reported to my father much gratified by the evident pleasure of the general at my diligence and at the news i had brought from early and his men after a nights rest and two good meals i returned to my command never telling my comrades until long afterward what had been done to me by the commanding general my fathers relations with the citizens of petersburg were of the kindest description the ladies were ever trying to make him more comfortable sending him of their scanty fare more than they could well spare he always tried to prevent them and when he could do so without hurting their feelings he would turn over to the hospitals the dainties sent himmuch to the disgust of his messsteward bryan bryan was an irishman perfectly devoted to my father and in his opinion there was nothing in the eatable line which was too good for the general he was an excellent caterer a good forager and but for my fathers frowning down anything approaching lavishness the headquarters table would have made a much better show during this period of the war bryan was so handicapped by the universal scarcity of all sorts of provisions that his talents were almost entirely hidden the ladies not only were anxious to feed the general but also to clothe him from camp petersburg he writes to my mother june 24th the ladies of petersburg have sent me a nice set of shirts they were given to me by mrs james r branch and her mother mrs thomas branch in fact they have given me everything which i fear they cannot sparevegetables bread milk icecream today one of them sent me a nice peachthe first one i think i have seen for two years i sent it to mrs shippen an invalid lady in the yard of whose country place violet bank lees tents were pitched mr platt had services again today under the trees near my camp we had quite a large congregation of citizens ladies and gentlemen and our usual number of soldiers during the services i constantly heard the shells crashing among the houses of petersburg tell life his pet name for my sister mildred i send her a song composed by a french soldier as she is so learned in the language i want he to send my a reply in verse june 30 1864 the anniversary of his wedding day he thus writes to my mother i was very glad to receive your letter yesterday and to hear that you were better i trust that you will continue to improve and soon be as well as usual god grant that you may be entirely restored in his own good time do you recollect what a happy day thirtythree years ago this was how many hopes and pleasures it gave birth to god has been very merciful and kind to us and how thankless and sinful i have been i pray that he may continue his mercies and blessings to us and give us a little peace and rest together in this world and finally gather us and all he has given us around his throne in the world to come the president has just arrived and i must bring my letter to a close my mother had been quite ill that summer and my fathers anxiety for her comfort and welfare his desire to be with her to help her was very great the sick in the confederacy at this period of universal scarcity suffered for want of the simplest medicines all that could be had were given to hospitals to his youngest daughter the general writes and sends to mrs lee what little he could find in the way of fruit i received this morning by your brother your note of the 3d and am glad to hear that your mother is better i sent out immediately to try to find some lemons but could only procure two sent to me by a kind lady mrs kirkland in petersburg these were gathered from her own trees there are none to be purchased i found one in my valise dried up which i also send as it may prove of some value i also put up some early apples which you can roast for your mother and one pear this is all the fruit i can get you must go to the market every morning and see if you cannot find some fruit for her there are no lemons to be had tell her lemonade is not as palatable or digestible as buttermilk try to get some good buttermilk for her with ice it is delicious and very nutritious my sister mildred had a pet squirrel which ran about the house in richmond she had named it custis morgan after her brother custis and general john morgan the great cavalry leader of the western army he ventured out one day to see the city and never returned in a letter to mildred july 10th my father alludes to his escape and apparently considers it a blessing i was pleased on the arrival of my little courier to learn that you were better and that custis morgan was still among the missing i think the farther he gets from you the better you will be the shells scattered the poor inhabitants of petersburg so that many of the churches are closed indeed they have been visited by the enemys shells mr platt pastor of the principal episcopal church had services at my headquarters today the services were under the trees and the discourse on the subject of salvation about this time the enemy having been at work on a mine for nearly a month exploded it and attacked our lines with a large force the ensuing contest was called the battle of the crater general lee having suspected that a mine was being run under his works was partly prepared for it and the attack was repulsed very quickly with great loss to the enemy in the address of capt w gordon mccabe before the association of the army of northern virginianovember 2 1876speaking of this event he says from the mysterious paragraphs in the northern papers and from reports of deserters though those last were vague and contradictory lee and beauregard suspected that the enemy was mining in front of some one of the three salients on beauregards front and the latter officer had in consequence directed countermines to be sunk from all three meanwhile constructing gorgelines in the rear upon which the troops might retire in case of surprise or disaster but the countermining on the part of the confederates was after a time discontinued owing to the lack of proper tools the inexperience of the troops in such work and the arduous nature of their service in the trenches the mine was sprung july 30th on the 31st the general writes yesterday morning the enemy sprung a mine under one of our batteries on the line and got possession of a portion of our intrenchments it was the part defended by general beauregards troops i sent general mahone with two brigades of hills corps who charged them handsomely recapturing the intrenchments and guns twelve stands of colours seventythree officers including general bartlett his staff three colonels and eight hundred and fifty enlisted men there were upward of five hundred of his dead and unburied in the trenches among them many officers and blacks he suffered severely he has withdrawn his troops from the north side of the james i do not know what he will attempt next he is mining on other points along our line i trust he will not succeed in bettering his last attempt grant by means of a pontoon bridge permanently established across the james was able to move his troops very quickly from one side to the other and could attack either flank while making a feint on the opposite one this occurred several times during the summer but general lee seemed always to have anticipated the movement and to be able to distinguish the feint from the real attack on august 14th he speaks of one of these movements in a letter to my mother i have been kept from church today by the enemys crossing to the north side of the james river and the necessity of moving troops to meet him i do not know what his intentions are he is said to be cutting a canal across the dutch gap a point in the riverbut i cannot as yet discover it i was up there yesterday and saw nothing to indicate it we shall ascertain in a day or two i received today a kind letter from reverend mr cole of culpeper court house he is a most excellent man in all the relations of life he says there is not a church standing in all that country within the lines formerly occupied by the enemy all are razed to the ground and the materials used often for the vilest purposes two of the churches at the court house barely escaped destruction the pews were all taken out to make seats for the theatre the fact was reported to the commanding officer by their own men of the christian commission but he took no steps to rebuke or arrest it we must suffer patiently to the end when all things will be made right to oppose this movement of august 14th which was in heavy force our cavalry division was moved over to the north side together with infantry and artillery and we had a very lively time for several days in the engagement on the 15th of august i was shot in the arm and disabled for about three weeks the wound was a very simple onejust severe enough to give me a furlough which i enjoyed intensely time heals all wounds it is said i remember it cured mine all too soon for being on a wounded leave provided it did not keep one in bed was the best luck a soldier could have i got back the last of september and in passing stopped to see my father i take from general long a penpicture of him at this time which accords with my own recollection of his appearance general lee continued in excellent health and bore his many cares with his usual equanimity he had aged somewhat in appearance since the beginning of the war but had rather gained than lost in physical vigour from the severe life he had led his hair had grown gray but his face had the ruddy hue of health and his eyes were as clear and bright as ever his dress was always a plain gray uniform with cavalry boots reaching to his knees and a broadbrimmed gray felt hat he seldom wore a weapon and his only mark of rank was the stars on his collar though always abstemious in diet he seemed able to bear any amount of fatigue being capable of remaining in his saddle all day and at his desk half the night i cannot refrain from further quoting from the same author this beautiful description of the mutual love respect and esteem existing between my father and his soldiers no commander was ever more careful and never had care for the comfort of an army given rise to greater devotion he was constantly calling the attention of the authorities to the wants of his soldiers making every effort to provide them with food and clothing the feeling for him was one of love not of awe and dread they could approach him with the assurance that they would be received with kindness and consideration and that any just complaint would receive proper attention there was no condescension in his manner but he was ever simple kind and sympathetic and his men while having unbounded faith in him as a leader almost worshipped him as a man these relations of affection and mutual confidence between the army and its commander had much to do with the undaunted bravery displayed by the men and bore a due share in the many victories they gained colonel charles marshall in his address before the association of the army of northern virginia also alludes to this wonderful influence over the troops under his command i can best describe that influence by saying that such was the love and veneration of the men for him that they came to look upon the cause as general lees cause and they fought for it because they loved him to them he represented cause country and all all persons who were ever thrown into close relations with him had somewhat these same feelings how could they help it here is a letter to his youngest daughter which shows his beautiful love and tenderness for us all throughout the war he constantly took the time from his arduous labours to send to his wife and daughters such evidences of his affection for them camp petersburg november 6 1864 my precious life this is the first day i have had leisure to answer your letter i enjoyed it very much at the time of its reception and have enjoyed it since but i have often thought of you in the meantime and have seen you besides indeed i may say you are never out of my thoughts i hope you think of me often and if you could know how earnestly i desire your true happiness how ardently i pray you may be directed to every good and saved from every evil you would as sincerely strive for its accomplishment now in your youth you must be careful to discipline your thoughts words and actions habituate yourself to useful employment regular improvement and to the benefit of all those around your you have had some opportunity of learning the rudiments of your educationnot as good as i should have desired but i am much cheered by the belief that you availed yourself of itand i think you are now prepared by diligence and study to learn whatever you desire do not allow yourself to forget what you have spent so much time and labour acquiring but increase it every day by extended application i hope you will embrace in your studies all useful acquisitions i was much pleased to hear that while at bremo you passed much of your time in reading and music all accomplishments will enable you to give pleasure and thus exert a wholesome influence never neglect the means of making yourself useful in the world i think you will not have to complain of rob again for neglecting your schoolmates he has equipped himself with a new uniform from top to toe and with a new and handsome horse is cultivating a marvellous beard and preparing for conquest i went down on the lines to the right friday beyond rowanty creek and pitched my camp within six miles of fitzhughs last night rob came up and spent the night with me and fitzhugh appeared early in the morning they rode with me till late that day i visited the battlefield in that quarter and general hampton in describing it said there had not been during the war a more spirited charge than fitzhughs division made that day up the boydton plank road driving cavalry and infantry before him in which he was stopped by night i did not know before that his horse had been shot under him give a great deal of love to your dear mother and kiss your sisters for me tell them they must keep well not talk too much and go to bed early ever your devoted father r e lee he refers in this letter to his coming down near our command and my brothers visit and mine to him everything was quiet and we greatly enjoyed seeing him and being with him the weather too was fine and he seemed to delight in our ride with him along the lines i didnt think i saw him but once more until everything was over and we met in richmond some time before this my mother fearing for his health under the great amount of exposure and work he had to do wrote to him and begged him to take better care of himself in his reply he says but what care can a man give to himself in the time of war it is from no desire for exposure or hazard that i live in a tent but from necessity i must be where i can speedily at all times attend to the duties of my position and be near or accessible to the officers with whom i have to act i have been offered rooms in the houses of our citizens but i could not turn the dwellings of my kind hosts into a barrack where officers couriers distressed women etc would be entering day and night general fitz lee in his life of my father says of him at this time selfpossessed and calm lee struggled to solve the huge military problem and make the sum of smaller numbers equal to that of greater numbers his thoughts ever turned upon the soldiers of his army the ragged gallant fellows around himwhose pinched cheeks told hunger was their portion and whose shivering forms denoted the absence of proper clothing his letters to my mother during the winter tell how much his men were in need my mother was an invalid from rheumatism confined to a rollingchair to help the cause with her own hands as far as she could she was constantly occupied in knitting socks for the soldiers and induced all around her to do the same she sent them directly to my father and he always acknowledged them november 30th he says i received yesterday your letter on the 27th and am glad to learn your supply of socks is so large if two or three hundred would send an equal number we should have a sufficiency i will endeavour to have them distributed to the most needy and on december 17th i received day before yesterday the box with hats gloves and socks also the barrel of apples you had better have kept the latter as it would have been more useful to you than to me and i should have enjoyed its consumption by you and the girls more than by me his friends and admirers were constantly sending him presents some simple mementos of their love and affection others substantial and material comforts for the outer and inner man the following letter from its date is evidently an acknowledgement of christmas gifts sent him december 30th the lyons furs and fur robe have also arrived safely but i can learn nothing of the saddle of mutton bryan of whom i inquired as to its arrival is greatly alarmed lest it has been sent to the soldiers dinner if the soldiers get it i shall be content i can do very well without it in fact i should rather they should have it than i the soldiers dinner here referred to was a christmas dinner sent by the entire country as far as they could to the poor starving men in the trenches and camps along the lines it would not be considered much now but when the conditions were such as my father describes when he wrote the secretary of war the struggle now is to keep the army fed and clothed only fifty men in some regiments have shoes and bacon is only issued once in a few days anything besides the onequarter of a pound of bacon and musty cornbread was a treat of great service and might be construed as a christmas dinner i have mentioned before my fathers devotion to children this sentiment pervaded his whole nature at any time the presence of a little child would bring a brightness to his smile a tender softness to his glance and drive away gloom or care here is his account of a visit paid him early in january 1865 by three little women yesterday afternoon three little girls walked into my room each with a small basket the eldest carried some fresh eggs laid by her own hens the second some pickles made by her mother the third some popcorn grown in her garden they were accompanied by a young maid with a block of soap made by her mother they were the daughters of a mrs nottingham a refugee from northhampton county who lived near eastville not far from old arlington the eldest of the girls whose age did not exceed eight years had a small wheel on which she spun for her mother who wove all the cloth for her two brothersboys of twelve and fourteen years i have not had so pleasant a visit for a long time i fortunately was able to fill their baskets with apples which distressed poor bryan his messsteward and i begged them to bring me nothing but kisses and to keep the eggs corn etc for themselves i pray daily and almost hourly to our heavenly father to come to the relief of you and our afflicted country i know he will order all things for our good and we must be content fort fisher capturedlee made commanderinchiefbattle of five forksthe generals farewell to his menhis reception in richmond after the surrenderpresident davis hears the newslees

enemy to break through it was daily becoming less the capture of fort fisher our last open port january 15th cut off all supplies and munitions from the outside world sherman had reached savannah in december from which point he was ready to unite with grant at any time from general lees letters official and private one gets a clear view of the desperateness of his position he had been made commanderinchief of all the military forces in the confederate states on february 6th in his order issued on accepting this command he says deeply impressed with the difficulties and responsibilities of the position and humbly invoking the guidance of almighty god i rely for success upon the courage and fortitude of the army sustained by the patriotism and firmness of the people confident that their united efforts under the blessing of heaven will secure peace and independence general beauregard who had so ably defended petersburg when it was first attacked and who had assisted so materially in its subsequent defense had been sent to gather troops to try to check shermans advance through the carolinas but beauregards health was now very bad and it was feared he would have to abandon the field in a letter to the secretary of war dated february 21 1865 my father says in the event of the necessity of abandoning our position on james river i shall endeavour to unite the corps of the army about burkeville junction of southside and danville railroad so as to retain communication with the north and south as long as practicable and also with the west i should think lynchburg or some point west the most advantageous place to which to remove stores from richmond this however is a most difficult point at this time to decide and the place may have to be changed by circumstances it was my intention in my former letter to apply for general joseph e johnston that i might assign him to duty should circumstances permit i have had no official report of the condition of general beauregards health it is stated from many sources to be bad if he should break down entirely it might be fatal in that event i should have no one with whom to supply his place i therefore respectfully request general johnston may be ordered to report to me and that i may be informed where he is in a letter to the secretary of war written the next day but you may expect sheridan to move up the valley and stoneman from knoxville as sherman draws near roanoke what then will become of those sections of the country i know of no other troops that could be given to beauregard bragg will be forced back by schofield i fear and until i abandon james river nothing can be sent from this army grant i think is now preparing to draw out by his left with the intent of enveloping me he may wait till his other columns approach nearer or he may be preparing to anticipate my withdrawal i cannot tell yet everything of value should be removed from richmond it is of the first importance to save all powder the cavalry and artillery of the army are still scattered for want of provender and our supply and ammunition trains which out to be with the army in case of sudden movement are absent collecting provisions and foragesome in western virginia and some in north carolina you will see to what straits we are reduced but i trust to work out on the same day in a letter to my mother he writes after sending my note this morning i received from the express office a back of socks you will have to send down your offerings as soon as you can and bring your work to a close for i think general grant will move against us soonwithin a week if nothing preventsand no man can tell what may be the result but trusting to a merciful god who does not always give the battle to the strong i pray we may not be overwhelmed i shall however endeavour to do my duty and fight to the last should it be necessary to abandon our position to prevent being surrounded what will you do you must consider the question and make up your mind it is a fearful condition and we must rely for guidance and protection upon a kind providence about this time i saw my father for the last time until after the surrender we had been ordered up to the army from our camp nearly forty miles away reaching the vicinity of petersburg the morning of the attack of general gordon on fort stedman on march 25th my brother and i had ridden ahead of the division to report its presence when we met the general riding traveller almost alone back from that part of the lines opposite the fort since then i have often recalled the sadness of his face its careworn expression when he caught sight of his two sons a bright smile at once lit up his countenance and he showed very plainly his pleasure at seeing us he thanked my brother for responding so promptly to his call upon him and regretted that events had so shaped themselves that the division would not then be needed as he had hoped it would be no good results followed gordons gallant attack his supports did not come up a the proper time and our losses were very heavy mostly prisoners two days after this sheridan with ten thousand mounted men joined grant having marched from the valley of virginia via staunton and charlottesville on the 28th everything being ready general grant commenced to turn our right and having more than three men to our one he had no difficult task on that very day my father wrote to my mother i have received your note with a bag of socks i return the bag and receipt the count is all right this time i have put in the bag general scotts autobiography which i thought you might like to read the general of course stands out prominently and does not hide his light under a bushel but he appears the bold sagacious truthful man that he is i inclose a note from little agnes i shall be very glad to see her tomorrow but cannot recommend pleasure trips now on april 1st the battle of five forks was fought where about fifty thousand infantry and cavalrymore men than were in our entire armyattacked our extreme right and turned it so that to save our communications we had to abandon our lines at petersburg giving up that city and richmond form that time to april 9th the army of northern virginia struggled to get back to some position where it could concentrate its forces and make a stand but the whole world knows of that sixdays retreat i shall not attempt to describe it in detailindeed i could not if i would for i was not present all the timebut will quote from those who have made it a study and who are far better fitted to record it than i am general early in his address at lexington virginia january 19 1872general lees birthdayeloquently and briefly describes these six days as follows the retreat from the lines of richmond and petersburg began in the early days of april and the remnant of the army of northern virginia fell back more than one hundred miles before its overpowering antagonists repeatedly presenting front to the latter and giving battle so as to check his progress finally from mere exhaustion less than eight thousand men with arms in their hands of the noblest army that ever fought in the tide of time were surrendered at appomattox to an army of 150000 men the sword of robert e lee without a blemish on it was sheathed forever and the flag to which he had added such luster was furled to be henceforth embalmed in the affectionate remembrance of those who remained faithful during all our trials and will do so to the end colonel archer anderson in his address at the unveiling of the lee monument in richmond virginia may 29 1890 speaking of the siege of petersburg and of the surrender utters these noble words of the siege of petersburg i have only time to say that in it for nine months the confederate commander displayed every art by which genius and courage can make good the lack of numbers and resources but the increasing misfortunes of the confederate arms on other theatres of the war gradually cut off the supply of men and means the army of northern virginia ceased to be recruited it ceased to be adequately fed it lived for months on less than onethird rations it was demoralised not by the enemy in its front but by the enemy in georgia and the carolinas it dwindled to 35000 men holding a front of thirtyfive miles but over the enemy it still cast the shadow of its great name again and again by a bold offensive it arrested the federal movement to fasten on its communications at last an irresistible concentration of forces broke through its long thin line of battle petersburg had to be abandoned richmond was evacuated trains bearing supplies were intercepted and a starving army harassed for seven days by incessant attacks on rear and flank found itself completely hemmed in by overwhelming masses nothing remained to it but its stainless honour its unbroken courage in those last solemn scenes when strong men losing all selfcontrol broke down and sobbed like children lee stood forth as great as in the days of victory and triumph no disaster crushed his spirit no extremity of danger ruffled his bearing in the agony of dissolution now invading that proud army which for four years had wrested victory from every peril in that blackness of utter darkness he preserved the serene lucidity of his mind he looked the stubborn facts calmly in the face and when no military resource remained when he recognised the impossibility of making another march or fighting another battle he bowed his head in submission to that power which makes and unmakes nations the surrender of the fragments of the army of northern virginia closed the imperishable record of his military life from the london standard at the time of his last illness i quote these words relative to this retreat when the army of northern virginia marched out of the lines around petersburg and richmond it still numbered some twentysix thousand men after a retreat of six days in the face of an overwhelming enemy with a crushing artillerya retreat impeded by constant fighting and harassed by countless hordes of cavalryeight thousand were given up by the capitulation at appomattox court house brilliant as were general lees earlier triumphs we believe that he gave higher proofs of genius in his last campaign and that hardly any of his victories were so honourable to himself and his army as that of his sixdays retreat swinton in his history of the army of the potomac after justly praising its deeds thus speaks of its great opponent the army of northern virginia nor can there fail to arise the image of that other army that was the adversary of the army of the potomac andwho that once looked upon it can ever forget itthat array of tattered uniforms and bright musketsthat body of incomparable infantry the army of northern virginia which for four years carried the revolt on its bayonets opposing a constant front to the mighty concentration of power brought against it which receiving terrible blows did not fail to give the like and which vital in all its parts died only with its annihilation general long in speaking of its hardships and struggles during the retreat thus describes how the army looked up to their commander and trusted him to bring them through all their troubles general lee had never appeared more grandly heroic than on this occasion all eyes were raised to him for a deliverance which no human seemed able to give he alone was expected to provide food for the starving army and rescue it from the attacks of a powerful and eager enemy under the accumulation of difficulties his courage seemed to expand and wherever he appeared his presence inspired the weak and weary with renewed energy to continue the toilsome march during these trying scenes his countenance wore its habitual calm grave expression those who watched his face to catch a glimpse of what was passing in his mind could gather thence no trace of his inner sentiments no one can tell what he suffered he did in all things what he considered right self he absolutely abandoned as he said so he believed that human virtue should equal human calamity a day or two before the surrender he said to general pendleton i have never believed we could against the gigantic combination for our subjugation make good in the long run our independence unless foreign powers should directly or indirectly assist us but such considerations really made with me no difference we had i was satisfied sacred principles to maintain and rights to defend for which we were in duty bound to do our best even if we perished in the endeavour after his last attempt was made with gordon and fitz lee to break through the lines of the enemy in the early morning of the 9th and colonel veneble informed him that it was not possible he said then there is nothing left me but to go and see general grant when some one near him hearing this said oh general what will history say of the surrender of the army in the field he replied yes i know they will say hard things of us they will not understand how we were overwhelmed by numbers but that is not the question colonel the question is is it right to surrender this army if it is right then i will take all the responsibility there had been some correspondence with grant just before the conversation with general pendleton after gordons attack failed a flag of truce was sent out and about eleven oclock general lee went to meet general grant the terms of surrender were agreed upon and then general lee called attention to the pressing needs of his men he said i have a thousand or more of your men and officers whom we have required to march along with us for several days i shall be glad to send them to your lines as soon as it can be arranged for i have no provisions for them my own men have been living for the last few days principally upon parched cord and we are badly in need of both rations and forage grant said he would at once send him 25000 rations general lee told him that amount would be ample and a great relief he then rode back to his troops the rations issued then to our army were the supplies destined for us but captured at amelia court house had they reached us in time they would have given the halfstarved troops that were left strength enough to make a further struggle general long graphically pictures the last scenes it is impossible to describe the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army was inevitable of all their trials this was the greatest and hardest to endure there was no consciousness of shame each heart could boast with honest pride that its duty had been done to the end and that still unsullied remained its honour when after this interview with general grant general lee again appeared a shout of welcome instinctively went up from the army but instantly recollecting the sad occasion that brought him before them their shouts sank into silence every hat was raised and the bronzed faces of thousands of grim warriors were bathed in tears as he rode slowly along the lines hundreds of his devoted veterans pressed around the noble chief trying to take his hand touch his person or even lay their hands upon his horse thus exhibiting for him their great affection the general then with head bare and tears flowing freely down his manly cheeks bade adieu to the army in a few words men we have fought through the war together i have done my best for you my heart is too full to say more he bade them goodbye and told them to return to their homes and become good citizens the next day he issued his farewell address the last order published to the army headquarters army of northern virginia april 10 1865 after four years of arduous service marked by unsurpassed courage and fortitude the army of northern virginia has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources i need not tell the survivors of so many hardfought battles who have remained steadfast to the last that i have consented to this result from no distrust of them but feeling that valour and devotion could accomplish nothing that could compensate for the loss that would have attended the continuation of the contest i have determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their countrymen by the terms of the agreement officers and men can return to their homes and remain there until exchanged you will take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty faithfully performed and i earnestly pray that a merciful god will extend to you his blessing and protection with an increasing admiration of your constancy and devotion to your country and a grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration of myself i bid you an affectionate farewell r e lee general general long says that general meade called on general lee on the 10th and in the course of conversation remarked now that the war may be considered over i hope you will not deem it improper for me to ask for my personal information the strength of your army during the operations around richmond and petersburg general lee replied at no time did my force exceed 35000 men often it was less with a look of surprise meade answered general you amaze me we always estimated your force at about seventy thousand men general de chanal a french officer who was present states that general lee who had been an associate of meades in the engineers in the old army said to him pleasantly meade years are telling on you your hair is getting quite gray ah general lee was meades prompt reply it is not the work of years you are responsible for my gray hairs three days after the surrender says long the army of northern virginia had dispersed in every direction and three weeks later the veterans of a hundred battles had exchanged the musket and the sword for the implements of husbandry it is worthy of remark that never before was there an army disbanded with less disorder thousands of soldiers were set adrift on the world without a penny in their pockets to enable them to reach their homes yet none of the scenes of riot that often follow the disbanding of armies marked their course a day or two after the surrender general lee started for richmond riding traveller who had carried him so well all through the war he was accompanied by some of his staff on the way he stopped at the house of his eldest brother charles carter lee who lived on the upper james in powhatan county he spent the evening in talking with his brother but when bedtime came though begged by his host to take the room and bed prepared for him he insisted on going to his old tent pitched by the roadside and passed the night in the quarters he was accustomed to on april 15th he arrived in richmond the people there soon recognised him men women and children crowded around him cheering and waving hats and handkerchiefs it was more like the welcome to a conqueror than to a defeated prisoner on parole he raised his hat in response to their greetings and rode quietly to his home on franklin street where my mother and sisters were anxiously awaiting him thus he returned to that private family life for which he had always longed and become what he always desired to bea peaceful citizen in a peaceful land in attempting to describe these last days of the army of northern virginia i have quoted largely from long jones taylor and fitz lee all of whom have given more or less full accounts of the movements of both armies it so happened that shortly after we left our lines april 2d or 3d in one of the innumerable contests my horse was shot and in getting him and myself off the field having no choice of routes the pursuing federal cavalry intervened between men and the rest of our command so i had to make my way around the head of sheridans advance squadrons before i could rejoin our forces this i did not succeed in accomplishing until april 9th the day of the surrender for my wounded horse had to be left with a farmer who kindly gave me one in exchange saying i could send him back when i was able or if i was prevented that i could keep him and he would replace him with mine when he got well as i was riding toward appomattox on the 9th i met a body of our cavalry with general t h rosser at the head he told me that general lee and his army had surrendered and that this force had made its way out and was marching back to lynchburg expecting thence to reach general johnstons army to say that i was surprised does not express my feelings i had never heard the word surrender mentioned nor even a suggested in connection with our general or our army i could not believe it and did not until i was positively assured by all my friends who were with rossers column that it was absolutely so very sadly i turned back and went to lynchburg along with them there i found some wagons from our headquarters which had been sent back and with them the horses and servants of the staff these i got together not believing for an instant that our struggle was over and with several officers from our command and others we made our way to greensboro north carolina there i found mr davis and his cabinet and representatives of the confederate departments from richmond there was a great diversity of opinion amongst all present as to what we should do after waiting a couple of days looking over the situation from every point of view consulting with my uncle commodore s s lee of the confederate navy and with many others old friends of my father and staunch adherents of the southern cause it was determined to go back to virginia to get our paroles go home and go to work while at greensboro i went to see president davis just before he proceeded on his way further south he was calm and dignified and in his conversation with several officers of rank who were there seemed to think and so expressed himself that our cause was not lost though sorely stricken and that we could rally our forces west of the mississippi and make good our fight while i was in the room mr davis received the first official communication from general lee of his surrender colonel john taylor woods his aidedecamp had taken me in to see the president and he and i were standing by him when the despatch from general lee was brought to him after reading it he handed it without comment to us then turning away he silently wept bitter tears he seemed quite broken at the moment by this tangible evidence of the loss of his army and the misfortune of its general all of us respecting his great grief silently withdrew leaving him with colonel wood i never saw him again i started for richmond accompanied by several companions with the servants and horses belonging to our headquarters these i had brought down with me from lynchburg where i had found them after the surrender after two week of marching and resting i arrived in richmond and found my father there in the house on franklin street now the rooms of the virginia historical society and also my mother brother and sisters they were all much relieved at my reappearance as well as i can recall my father at this time he appeared to be very well physically though he looked older grayer more quiet and reserved he seemed very tired and was always glad to talk of any other subject than that of the war or anything pertaining thereto we all tried to cheer and help him and the people of richmond and of the entire south were as kind and considerate as it was possible to be indeed i think their great kindness tired him he appreciated it all was courteous grateful and polite but he had been under such a terrible strain for several years that he needed the time and quiet to get back his strength of heart and mind all sorts and conditions of people came to see him officers and soldiers from both armies statesmen politicians ministers of the gospel mothers and wives to ask about husbands and sons of whom they had heard nothing to keep him from being overtaxed by this incessant stream of visitors we formed a sort of guard of the young men in the house some of whom took it by turns to keep the door and if possible turn strangers away my father was gentle kind and polite to all and never willingly so far as i know refused to see any one dan lee late of the confederate states navy my first cousin and myself one day had charge of the front door when at it appeared a federal soldier accompanied by a darkey carrying a large willow basket filled to the brim with provisions of every kind the man was irish all over and showed by his uniform and carriage that he was a regular and not a volunteer on our asking him what he wanted he replied that he wanted to see general lee that he had heard down the street the general and his family were suffering for lack of something to eat that he had been with the colonel when he commanded the second cavalry and as long as he had a cent his old colonel should not suffer my father who had stepped into another room as he heard the bell ring hearing something of the conversation came out into the hall the old irishman as soon as he saw him drew himself up and saluted and repeated to the general with tears streaming down his cheeks what he had just said to us my father was very much touched thanked him heartily for his kindness and generosity but told him that he did not need the things he had brought and could not take them this seemed to disappoint the old soldier greatly and he pleaded so hard to be allowed to present the supplies to his old colonel whom he believed to be in want of them that at last my father said that he would accept the basket and sent it to the hospital for the sick and wounded who were really in great need though he was not satisfied he submitted to this compromise and then to our surprise and dismay in bidding the general goodbye threw his arms around him and was attempting to kiss him when dan and i interfered as he was leaving he said goodbye colonel god bless ye if i could have got over in time i would have been with ye a day or two after that when dan was doorkeeper three federal officers a colonel a major and a doctor called and asked to see general lee they were shown into the parlour presented their cards and said they desired to pay their respects as officers of the united states army when dan went out with the three cards he was told by some one that my father was up stairs engaged with some other visitor so he returned and told them this and they departed when my father came down was shown the cards and told of the three visitors he was quite put out at dans not having brought him the cards at the time and that afternoon mounted him on one of his horses and sent him over to manchester where they were camped to look up the three officers and to tell them he would be glad to see them at any time they might be pleased to call however dan failed to find them he had another visit at this time which affected him deeply two confederate soldiers in very dilapidated clothing worn and emaciated in body came to see him they said they had been selected from about sixty other fellows too ragged to come themselves to offer him a home in the mountains of virginia the home was a good house and farm and near by was a defile in some rugged hills from which they could defy the entire federal army they made this offer of a home and their protection because there was a report that he was about to be indicted for treason the general had to decline to go with them but the tears came into his eyes at this hearty exhibition of loyalty after being in richmond a few days and by the advice of my father getting my parole from the united states provost marshal there the question as to what i should do came up my father told me that i could go back to college if i desired and prepare myself for some professionthat he had a little money which he would be willing and glad to devote to the completion of my education i think he was strongly in favour of my going back to college at the same time he told me that if i preferred it i could take possession of my farm land in king william county which i had inherited from my grandfather mr custis and make my home there as there was little left of the farm but the land he thought he could arrange to help me build a house and purchase stock and machinery my brother general w h f lee had already gone down to his place the white house in new kent county with major john lee our first cousin had erected a shanty and gone to work breaking up land for a corn crop putting their cavalry horses to the plow as i thought my father had use for any means he might have in caring for my mother and sisters and as i had this property i determined to become a farmer however i did not decide positively and in the meantime it was thought best that i should join my brother and cousin at the white house and help them make their crop of corn in returning to richmond i had left at hickory hill general wickhams place in hanover county our horses and servants taken with me from lynchburg to greensboro and back so bidding all my friends and family goodbye i went by rail to hickory hill and started the next day with three servants and about eight horses for new kent stopping the first night at pampatike the next day i reached the white house where the reinforcements i brought with me were hailed with delight though i have been a farmer from that day to this i will say that the crop of corn which we planted that summer with ourselves and army servants as laborers and our old cavalry horses as teams and which we did not finish planting until the 9th of june was the best i ever made lees conception of the parthis influence exerted toward the restoration of virginiahe visits old friends throughout the countryreceives offers of positionscompares notes with the union general hunterlongs for a country homefinds one at derwent near cartersville my father remained quietly in richmond with my mother and sisters he was now a private citizen for the first time in his life as he had always been a good soldier so now he became a good citizen my fathers advice to all his old officers and men was to submit to the authority of the land and to stay at home now that their native states needed them more than ever his advice and example had great influence with all in a letter to colonel walter taylor his old a a g he speaks on this point i am sorry to hear that our returned soldiers cannot obtain employment tell them they must all set to work and if they cannot do what they prefer do what they can virginia wants all their aid all their support and the presence of all her sons to sustain and recuperate her they must therefore put themselves in a position to take part in her government and not be deterred by obstacles in their way there is much to be done which they only can do and in a letter a month later to an officer asking his opinion about a decree of the emperor of mexico encouraging the emigration from the south to that country i do not know how far their emigration to another land will conduce to their prosperity although prospects may not now be cheering i have entertained the opinion that unless prevented by circumstances or necessity it would be better for them and the country if they remained at their homes and shared the fate of their respective states again in a letter to governor letcher the war governor of virginia the duty of its citizens then appears to me too plain to admit of doubt all should unite in honest efforts to obliterate the effects of the war and to restore the blessing of peace they should remain if possible in the country promote harmony and good feeling qualify themselves to vote and elect to the state and general legislatures wise and patriotic men who will devote their abilities to the interests of the country and the healing of all dissensions i have invariably recommended this course since the cessation of hostilities and have endeavoured to practise it myself also in a letter of still later date to captain josiah tatnall of the confederate states navy he thus emphasises the same sentiment i believe it to be the duty of every one to unite in the restoration of the country and the reestablishment of peace and harmony these considerations governed be in the counsels i gave to others and induced me on the 13th of june to make application to be included in the terms of the amnesty proclamation these letters and many more show plainly his conception of what was right for all to do at this time i have heard him repeatedly give similar advice to relatives and friends and to strangers who sought it the following letters to general grant and to president johnson show how he gave to the people of the south an example of quiet submission to the government of the country richmond virginia june 13 1865 lieutenantgeneral u s grant commanding the armies of the united states general upon reading the presidents proclamation of the 29th ult i came to richmond to ascertain what was proper or required of me to do when i learned that with others the was to be indicted for treason by the grand jury at norfolk i had supposed that the officers and men of the army of northern virginia were by the terms of their surrender protected by the united states government from molestation so long as they conformed to its conditions i am ready to meet any charges that may be preferred against me and do not wish to avoid trail but if i am correct as to the protection granted by my parole and am not to be prosecuted i desire to comply with the provision of the presidents proclamation and therefore inclose the required application which i request in that event may be acted on i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee richmond virginia june 13 1865 his excellency andrew johnson president of the united states sir being excluded from the provisions of the amnesty and pardon contained in the proclamation of the 29th ult i hereby apply for the benefits and full restoration of all rights as privileges extended to those included in its terms i graduated at the military academy at west point in june 1829 resigned from the united states army april 1861 was a general in the confederate army and included in the surrender of the army of northern virginia april 9 1865 i have the honour to be very respectfully your obedient servant r e lee of this latter letter my brother custis lee writes me when general lee requested me to make a copy of this letter he remarked it was but right for him to set an example of making a formal submission to the civil authorities and that he thought by do doing he might possibly be in a better position to be of use to the confederates who were not protected by military paroles especially mr davis colonel charles marshall a grandson of chief justice marshall and lees military secretary says he general lee set to work to use his great influence to reconcile the people of the south to the hard consequences of their defeat to inspire them with hope to lead them to accept freely and frankly the government that had been established by the result of the war and thus relieve them from the military rule the advice and example of general lee did more to incline the scale in favour of a frank and manly adoption of that course of conduct which tended to the restoration of peace and harmony than all the federal garrisons in all the military districts my father was at this time anxious to secure for himself and family a house somewhere in the country he had always had a desire to be the owner of a small farm where he could end his days in peace and quiet the life in richmond was not suited to him he wanted quiet and rest but could not get it there for people were too attentive to him so in the first days of june he mounted old traveller and unattended rode down to pampatikesome twentyfive milesto pay a visit of several days to his relations there this is an old carter property belonging then and now to colonel thomas h carter who but lately returned from appomattox court house was living there with his wife and children colonel carter whose father was a first cousin of general lees entered the army of northern virginia in the spring of 1861 as captain of the king william battery rose grade by grade by his skill and gallantry and surrendered in the spring of 1865 as colonel and chief of artillery of his corps at that time he was highly esteemed and much beloved by my father and our families had been intimate for a long time pampatike is a large oldfashioned plantation lying along the pamunkey river between the piping tree and new castle ferries part of the house is very old and from time to time as more rooms were needed additions have been made giving the whole a very quaint and picturesque appearance at the oldfashioned dinner hour of three oclock my father mounted on traveller unannounced unexpected and alone rode up to the door the horse and rider were at once recognised by colonel carter and he was gladly welcomed by his kinsfolk i am sure the days passed here were the happiest he had spent for many years he was very weary of town of the incessant unrest incident to his position of the crowds of persons of all sorts and conditions striving to see him so one can imagine the joy of master and horse when after a hot ride of over twenty miles they reached this quiet restingplace my father colonel carter tells me enjoyed every moment of his stay there were three children in the house the two youngest little girls of five and three years old these were his special delight and he followed them around talking babytalk to them and getting them to talk to him every morning before he was up they went into his room at his special request to pay him a visit another great pleasure was to watch traveller enjoy himself he had him turned out on the lawn where the june grass was very fine abundant and at its prime and would allow no cord to be fed to him saying he had had plenty of that during the last four years and that the grass and the liberty were what he needed he talked to colonel carter much about mexico its people and climate also about the old families living in that neighbourhood and elsewhere in the state with whom both colonel carter and himself were connected but he said very little about the recent war and only in answer to some direct question about six miles from pampatike on the same river and close to its banks is chericoke another old virginia homestead which had belonged to the braxtons for generations and at that time was the home of corbin braxtons widow general lee was invited to dine there and to meet him my brother cousin and i from the white house were asked besides general rosser who was staying in the neighbourhood and several others this old virginia house had long been noted for its lavish hospitality and bountiful table mrs braxton had never realised that the war should make any change in this respect and her table was still spread in those days of desolation as it had been before the war when there was plenty in the land so we sat down to a repast composed of all the good things for which that country was famous john and i did not seem to think there was too much in sightat any rate it did not daunt us and we did our best to lessen the quantity consuming i think our share and more we had been for so many years in the habit of being hungry that it was not strange we continued to be so awhile yet but my father took a different view of the abundance displayed and during his drive back said to colonel carter thomas there was enough dinner today for twenty people all this will now have to be changed you cannot afford it we shall have to practise economy in talking with colonel carter about the situation of farmers at that time in the south and of their prospects for the future he urged him to get rid of the negroes left on the farmsome ninetyodd in number principally women and children with a few old mensaying the government would provide for them and advised him to secure white labour the colonel told him he had to use for immediate needs such force as he had being unable at that time to get whites whereupon general lee remarked i have always observed that wherever you find the negro everything is going down around him and wherever you find a white man you see everything around him improving he was thinking strongly of taking a house in the country for himself and family and asked the colonel whether he could not suggest some part of the state that might suit him colonel carter mentioned clarke county as representing the naturalgrass section of virginia and gloucester county the saltwater my father unhesitatingly pronounced in favour of the grassgrowing country he told mrs carter how pleased he was to hear that she had received her husband in tears when he returned from the surrender as showing the true spirit for though glad to see him she wept because he could fight no more for the cause the day after this dinner he had to turn his back on those dear friends and their sweet home when traveller was brought up to the door for him to mount he walked all around him looking carefully at the horse saddle and bridle apparently the blanket was not arranged to suit him for he held the bridle while uncle henry took off the saddle then he took off the blanket himself spread it out on the grass and folding it to suit his own idea of fitness carefully placed it on travellers back and superintended closely the putting on and girthing of the saddle this being done he bade everybody goodbye and mounting his horse rode away homewardto richmond after crossing the pamunkey at newcastle ferry he rode into ingleside about a mile from the river the lovely home of mrs mary braxton here he dismounted and paid his respects to the mistress of the house and her daughters who were also cousins that afternoon he reached richmond returning by the same road he had travelled coming out after his visit which he had enjoyed so much he began looking about more than ever to find a country home the house he was occupying in richmond belonged to mr john stewart of brook hill who was noted for his devotion to the cause of the south and his kindness to all those who had suffered in the conflict my brother custis had rented it at the time he was appointed on mr daviss staff a mess had been established there by my brother and several other officers on duty in richmond in time my mother and sister had been made members of it and it had been the headquarters of all of the family during the war when in town my father was desirous of making some settlement with his landlord for its long use but before he could take the final steps my mother received the following note from mr stewart i am not presuming on your good opinion when i feel that you will believe me first that you and yours are heartily welcome to the house as long as your convenience leads you to stay in richmond and next that you owe me nothing but if you insist on paying that the payment must be in confederate currency for which along it was rented to your son you do not know how much gratification it is and will afford me and my whole family during the remainder of our lives to reflect that we have been brought into contact and to know and to appreciate you and all that are dear to you my father had been offered since the surrender houses lands and money as well as positions as president of business associations and chartered corporations an english nobleman long says desired him to accept a mansion and an estate commensurate with his individual merits and the greatness of an historic family he replied i am deeply grateful i cannot desert my native state in the hour of her adversity i must abide her fortunes and share her fate until his death he was constantly in receipt of such offers all of which he thought proper to decline he wrote to general long i am looking for some little quiet home in the woods where i can procure shelter and my daily bread if permitted by the victor i wish to get mrs lee out of the city as soon as practical it so happened that nearly exactly what he was looking for was just then offered to him mrs elizabeth randolph cocke of cumberland county a granddaughter of edmund randolph had on her estate a small cottage which with the land attached she placed at his disposal the retired situation of this little home and the cordial way in which mrs cocke insisted on his coming induced my father to accept her invitation captain edmund randolph cocke mrs cockes second son who lived with his mother at oakland writes me the following oakland virginia october 25 1896 my mother whose sympathies for everybody and everything connected with our cause were the greatest and most enlarged of any one i ever knew thought it might be agreeable and acceptable to general lee to have a retired placed in which to rest having this little house unoccupied she invited him to accept it as a home as long as he might find it pleasant to himself the general came up with your mother and sisters about the last of june general custis lee having preceded them a day or two on traveller at that time our mode of travel was on the canal by horsepacket leaving richmond at a little before sunset the boat reached pemberton our landing about sunrise general custis and i went down to meet them and we all reached home in time for breakfast that night on the boat the captain had had the most comfortable bed put up that he could command which was offered to your father but he preferred to sleep on deck which he did with his military cloak thrown over him no doubt that was the last night he ever spent under the open sky after a week spent here general lee removed with his family to derwent there he spent several months of quiet and rest only interrupted by the calls of those who came in all honesty and sincerity to pay their respects to him old soldiers citizens men and women all came without parade or ceremony during this time he rode on traveller daily taking sometimes long tripsonce i recall going to his brothers mr carter lees about twenty miles and at another time to bremo about thirty miles during the month of august he was visited by judge brockenborough of lexington who as rector of the board of trustees of washington college tendered him on behalf of the board the presidency of the college after considering the matter for several weeks he decided to accept this position during that summer he was a regular attendant at the various churches in our neighbourhood whenever there was a service i never heard your father discuss public matters at all nor did he express his opinion of public men on one occasion i did hear him condemn with great severity the secretary of war stanton this was at the time mrs surratt was condemned and executed at another time i heard him speak harshly of general hunter who had written to him to get his approval of his movements during the valley campaign against general early with these exceptions i never heard him speak of public men or measures in this connection i quote the rev j wm jones in his personal reminiscences of general robert e lee not long after the close of the war general lee received a letter from general david hunger of the federal army in which he begged information on two points 1 his hunters campaign in the summer of 1864 was undertaken on information received at the war department in washington that general lee was about to detach forty thousand picked troops to send general johnston did not his hunters movements prevent this and relieve sherman to that extent 2 when he hunter found it necessary to retreat from before lynchburg did not he adopt the most feasible line of retreat general lee wrote a very courteous reply in which he said the information upon which your campaign was undertaken was erroneous i had no troops to spare general johnston and no intention of sending him anycertainly not forty thousand as that would have taken about all i had as to the second pointi would say that i am not advised as to the motives which induced you to adopt the line of retreat which you took and am not perhaps competent to judge of the question but i certainly expected you to retreat by way of the shenandoah valley the emphasis is dr joness and was gratified at the time that you preferred the route through the mountains of the ohioleaving the valley open for general earlys advance into maryland before leaving richmond my father wrote the following letter to colonel ordway then provost marshal richmond virginia june 21 1865 ltcol albert ordway provost marshal department of virginia colonel i propose establishing my family next week in cumberland county virginia near cartersville on the james river canal on announcing my intention to general patrick when he was on duty in richmond he stated that no passport for the purpose was necessary should there have been any change in the orders of the department rendering passports necessary i request that i may be furnished with them my son g w custis lee a paroled prisoner with myself will accompany me very respectfully your obedient servant r e lee the latter part of june my father mother brother custis and sisters went to derwent the name of the little place which was to be his home for that summer they went by canalboat from richmond to cartersville and then had a drive of about six miles mrs cocke lived at oakland two miles away and her generous heart was made glad by the opportunity of supplying my father and his family with every comfort that it was possible to get at the time in his letters to me still at the white house busy with our corn he gives a description of the surroundings we are all well and established in a comfortable but small house in a grove of oaks belonging to mr thomas cocke mrs cockes eldest son it contains four rooms and there is a house in the yard which when fitted up will give us another only your mother agnes and mildred are with me custis who has had a return of his attackis at mrs cockes house about two miles offis convalescent i hope i have been nowhere as yet the weather has been excessively hot but this morning there is an agreeable change with some rain the country here is poor but healthy and we are at a long distance from you all i can do nothing until i learn what decision in my case is made in washington all unite with me in much love very truly your father r e lee the case referred to here was the indictment in june by a grand jury in norfolk virginia of mr davis general lee and others for treason or something like it the hon reverdy johnson offered his professional services to my father in this case but there was no trial as a letter from general grant to the authorities insisted that the parole given by him to the officers and soldiers of the army of northern virginia should be respected the following letter explains itself near cartersville virginia july 27 1865 hon reverdy johnson baltimore md my dear sir i very much regret that i did not see you on your recent visit to richmond that i might have thanked you for the interest you have shown in my behalf and you great kindness in offering me your professional services in the indictment which i now understand is pending against me i am very glad however that you had an opportunity of reading a copy of general grants letter of the 20th inst to me which i left with mr macfarland for that purpose and also that he might show it to other officers of the army of northern virginia in my condition i did not wish to give it greater publicity without the assent of general grant supposing that if he desired it made public he would take steps to have it done should he consent to your request to have it published i of course have no objection but should he not i request that you only use it in the manner i have above indicated again offering you my warmest thanks for your sympathy and consideration for my welfare i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee in another letter to me he tells of his visit to his brother charles carter lee in powhatan county which was an easy ride from derwent he was very fond of making these little excursion and traveller that summer was in constant use near cartersville july 22 1865 my dear rob i have just returned from a visit to your uncle carter and among my letters find one from some of your comrades to you which i inclose i was happy to discover from the direction that it was intended for you and not for me i find agnes quite sick and have sent for the doctor as i do not know what to do for her poor little thing she seems quite prostrated custis i am told is better he is still at mrs cockes the rest of us are well i saw several of your comrades cockes kennons and gilliams who inquired after you all give my love to f and johnny in which all here unite and believe me most truly and affectionately your father r e lee robert e lee in another letter he gives an account of a trip that he and traveller had taken across the river into albemarle county near cartersville august 21 1865 my dear bertus i received only a few days ago your letter of the 12th i am very sorry to hear of your afflictions but hope you have shaken off all of them you must keep your eyes open you precious boy and not run against noxious vines and fevers i have just returned from a visit to fluvanna i rode up the gray and extended my peregrinations into albemarle but no further than the green mountain neighbourhood i made short rides stopping every evening with some friend and had a very pleasant time i commended you to all the young ladies on the road but did not know i was extolling a poisoned beau you must go up and see miss francis galt tell fitzhugh i wrote to him before i went away i am glad to hear that your corn is so fine and that you are making preparations to put in a good crop of wheat i wish i had a little farm somewhere to be at work too custis is paying a visit to his friend captain watkins in powhatan he came up for him last saturday and bore him off he has got quite well now and i hope will continue so agnes is also well though still feeble and thin your mother life and myself as usual we have not heard for some time from daughter a report has reached us of her being at mr burwells miss mary cocke and her brother john paid us a short visit from saturday to monday and several of our neighbors have been over to spend the day we have a quiet time which is delightful to me but i fear not so exhilarating to the girls i missed uncle carters visit he and his robert rode up on a pair of colts while i was in fluvanna and spent several days i wish we were nearer you boys i want to see you very much but do not know when that can be i hope johnny is well i have heard nothing from his father since we parted in richmond but hear that fitz has gone to see his mother all here send their best love to you and i pray that every happiness may attend you your devoted father r e lee robert e lee bertus was a contraction of robertus my fathers pet name for me as a child my afflictions were poisonoak chills and fever the letter to my brother fitzhugh here referred to i also give near cartersville cumberland county virginia july 29 1865 my dear fitzhugh i was very glad to receive by the last packet from richmond your letter of the 22d we had all been quite anxious to hear from you and were much gratified to learn that you were all well and doing well it is very cheering to me to hear of your good prospects for corn and your cheerful prospects for the future god grant they may be realised which i am sure they will be if you will unite sound judgement to your usual energy in your operations as to the indictments i hope you at last may not be prosecuted i see no other reason for it than for prosecuting all who ever engaged in the war i think however we may expect procrastination in measures of relief denunciatory threats etc we must be patient and let them take their course as soon as i can ascertain their intention toward me if not prevented i shall endeavour to procure some humble but quiet abode for your mother and sisters where i hope they can be happy as i before said i want to get in some grass country where the natural product of the land will do much for my subsistence our neighbours are very kind and do everything in the world to promote our comfort if agnes is well enough i propose to ride up to bremo next week i wish i was near enough to see you give much love to rob and johnny the carters and braxtons all here unite in love and best wishes for you all most affectionately your father r e lee patriotic motives for acceptance of trustcondition of collegethe generals arrival at lexingtonhe prepares for the removal of his family to that cityadvice to robert juniortrip to bremo on private canalboatmrs lees invalidism about this time my father received from the board of trustees of washington college a notification of his election to the presidency of that institution at a meeting of the board held in lexington virginia on august 4 1865 the letter apprising him of the action was presented by judge john w brockenborough rector of the college this was a complete surprise to my father he had already been offered the vicechancellorship of the university of the south at sewanee tennessee but declined it on the ground that it was denominational and to some suggestions that he should connect himself with the university of virginia he objected because it was a state institution washington college had started as an academy in 1749 it was the first classical school opened in the valley of virginia after a struggle of many years under a succession of principals and with several changes of site it at length acquired such a reputation as to attract the attention of general washington he gave it a handsome endowment and the institution changed its name from liberty hall academy to washington college in the summer of 1865 the college through the calamities of civil war had reached the lowest point of depression it had ever known its buildings library and apparatus had suffered from the sack and plunder of hostile soldiery its invested funds owing to the general impoverishment throughout the land were for the time being rendered unproductive and their ultimate value was most uncertain four professors still remained on duty and there were about forty students mainly from the country around lexington it was not a state institution nor confined to any one religious denomination so two objections which might have been made by my father were removed but the college in later years had only a local reputation it was very poor indifferently equipped with buildings and with no means in sight to improve its condition there was a general expectation that he would decline the position as not sufficiently lucrative if his purpose was to repair the ruins of his private fortune resulting from the war as not lifting him conspicuously enough in the public gaze if he was ambitious of office or further distinction or as involving too great labour and anxiety if he coveted repose after the terrible contest from which he had just emerged professor e s joynes he was very reluctant to accept this appointment but for none of the above reasons as the average man might have been why he was doubtful of undertaking the responsibilities of such a position his letter of acceptance clearly shows he considered the matter carefully and then wrote the following letter to the committee powhatan county august 24 1865 gentlemen i have delayed for some days replying to your letter of the 5th inst informing me of my election by the board of trustees to the presidency of washington college from a desire to give the subject due consideration fully impressed with the responsibilities of the office i have feared that i should be unable to discharge its duties to the satisfaction of the trustees or to the benefit of the country the proper education of youth requires not only great ability but i fear more strength than i now possess for i do not feel able to undergo the labour of conducting classes in regular courses of instruction i could not therefore undertake more than the general administration and supervision of the institution i could not therefore undertake more than the general administration and supervision of the institution there is another subject which has caused me some serious reflection and is i think worthy of the consideration of the board being excluded from the terms of amnesty in the proclamation of the president of the united states of the 29th of may last and an object of censure to a portion of the country i have thought it probable that my occupation of the position of president might draw upon the college a feeling of hostility and i should therefore cause injury to an institution which it would be my highest desire to advance i think it the duty of every citizen in the present condition of the country to do all in his power to aid in the restoration of peace and harmony and in no way to oppose the policy of the state or general government directed to that object it is particularly incumbent on those charged with the instruction of the young to set them an example of submission to authority and i could not consent t be the cause of animadversion upon the college should you however take a different view and think that my services in the position tendered to me by the board will be advantageous to the college and country i will yield to your judgement and accept it otherwise i must most respectfully decline the office begging you to express to the trustees of the college my heartfelt gratitude for the honour conferred upon me and requesting you to accept my cordial thanks for the kind manner in which you have communicated their decision i am gentlemen with great respect your most obedient servant r e lee to present a clearer view of some of the motives influencing my father in accepting this trustfor such he considered iti give an extract from an address on the occasion of his death by bishop wilmer of louisiana delivered at the university of the south at sewanee tennessee i was seated says bishop wilmer at the close of the day in my virginia home when i beheld through the thickening shades of evening a horseman entering the yard whom i soon recognised as general lee the next morning he placed in my hands the correspondence with the authorities of washington college at lexington he had been invited to become president of that institution i confess to a momentary feeling of chagrin at the proposed change shall i say revulsion in his history the institution was one of local interest and comparatively unknown to our people i named others more conspicuous which would welcome him with ardour at the presiding head i soon discovered that his mind towered above these earthly distinctions that in his judgement the cause gave dignity to the institution and not the wealth of its endowment or the renown of its scholars that this door and not another was opened to him by providence and he only wished to be assured of his competency to fulfil his trust and this to make his few remaining years a comfort and blessing to his suffering country i had spoken to his human feelings he had now revealed himself to me as one whose life was hid with christ in god my speech was no longer restrained i congratulated him that his heart was inclined to this great cause and that he was prepared to give to the world this august testimony to the importance of christian education how he listened to my feeble words how he beckoned me to his side as the fulness of heart found utterance how his whole countenance glowed with animation as i spoke of the holy ghost as the great teacher whose presence was required to make education a blessing which otherwise might be the curse of mankind how feelingly he responded how eloquently as i never heard him speak beforecan never be effaced from memory and nothing more sacred mingles with my reminiscences of the dead the board of trustees on august 31st adopted and sent to general lee resolutions saying that in spite of his objections his connection with the institution would greatly promote its prosperity and advance the general interest of education and urged him to enter upon his duties as president at his earliest convenience my father had had nearly four years experience in the charge of young men at west point the conditions at that place to be sure were very different from those at the one to which he was now going but the work in the main was the sameto train improve and elevate i think he was influenced in making up his mind to accept this position by the great need of education in his state and in the south and by the opportunity that he saw at washington college for starting almost from the beginning and for helping by his experience and example the youth of his country to become good and useful citizens in the latter part of september he mounted traveller and started alone for lexington he was four days on the journey stopping with some friend each night he rode into lexington on the afternoon of the fourth day no one knowing of his coming until he quietly drew up and dismounted at the village inn professor white who had just turned into the main street as the general halted in front of the hotel said he knew in a moment that this stately rider on the irongray charger must be general lee he therefore at once went forward as two or three old soldiers gathered around to help the general down and insisted on taking him to the home of colonel reid the professors fatherinlaw where he had already been invited to stay my father with his usual consideration for others as it was late in the afternoon had determined to remain at the hotel that night and go to mr reids in the morning but yielding to captain whites he always called him captain his confederate title assurances that all was made ready for him he accompanied him to the home of his kind host the next morning before breakfast he wrote the following letter to my mother announcing his safe arrival the captain edmund and mr preston mentioned in it were the sons of our revered friend and benefactress mrs e r cocke colonel preston and captain frank were her brother and nephew lexington september 19 1865 my dear mary i reached here yesterday about one pm and on riding up to the hotel was met by professor white of washington college who brought me up to his fatherinlaws colonel reid the oldest member of the trustees of the college where i am very comfortably quartered today i will look out for accommodations elsewhere as the colonel has a large family and i fear i am intruding upon his hospitality i have not yet visited the college grounds they seem to be beautifully located and the buildings are undergoing repairs the house assigned to the president i am told has been rented to dr madison i believe who has not been able to procure another residence and i do not know when it will be vacated nor can i tell you more about it i saw mrs and colonel preston captain frank and his sister all the family are well i shall go after breakfast to inquire after my trunks i had a very pleasant journey here the first two days were very hot but reaching the mountain region the third day the temperature was much cooler i came up in four days easy rides getting to my stoppingplace by one pm each day except the third when i slept on top of the blue ridge which i reached at three pm the scenery was beautiful all the way i am writing before breakfast and must be short last night i found a blanket and coverlid rather light covering and this morning i see a fire in the diningroom i have thought much of you all since i left give much love to the girls and custis and remember me to all at oakland most affectionately yours r e lee mrs r e lee when he first arrived the family very naturally stood a little in awe of him this feeling however was soon dispelled for his simple and unaffected manners in a short while put them at ease there were some little children in the house and they and the general at once became great friends with these kind and hospitable friends he stayed several days after being present at a meeting of the board of trustees he rode traveller over to the rockbridge bathseleven miles from lexingtonand from there writes to my mother on september 25th am very glad to hear of robs arrival i am sorry that i missed seeing the latter but find it was necessary that i should have been present at the meeting of the board of trustees on the 20th they adjourned on the eve of the 21st and on the morning of the 22d i rode over here where i found annie and miss belle mrs chapman leigh and miss belle harrison of brandon both very dear friends and cousins of my father the babies mrs leighs are well and sweet i have taken the baths every day since my arrival and like them very much in fact they are delightful and i wish you were all here to enjoy them annie and belle go in two and sometimes three times a day yesterday i procured some horses and took them up to the top of jump mountain where we had one of the most beautiful views i ever saw today i could get but one horse and miss belle and i rode up hays creek valley which possessed beauties of a different kind i shall return to lexington on the 29th i perceive as yet no change in my rheumatic affection tell custis i am much obliged to him for his attention to my baggage all the articles enumerated by him arrived safely at colonel reids thursday morning early i also received the package of letters he sent i hope he may receive the appointment at the v m i everyone interested has expressed a desire he should do so and i am more desirous than all of them if he comes by land he will find the route i took very pleasant and about 108 miles namely bremodr wilmerswaynesborogreenville he will find me at the lexington hotel i wish you were all here with me i feel very solitary and miss you all dreadfully give much love to the girls and boyskind remembrances to mrs p miss louisa and mrs thos cocke i have no news most affectionately r e lee psannie and belle send a great deal of love to all r e l these little excursions and the meeting with old friends and dear cousins were sources of real enjoyment and grateful rest the pains of the past the worries of the present and the cares for the future were for the time being banished my father earnestly desired a quiet informal inauguration and his wish was gratified on october 2 1865 in the presence of the trustees professors and students after solemn and appropriate prayer by the rev w s white d d the oldest christian minister in the town the father of professor or captain white he took the oath of office as required by the laws of the college and was thus legally inaugurated as its president on october 3d he wrote my mother i am glad to hear that rob is improving and hope you had the pleasure of seeing mr dana our old pastor of christs church alexandria the trusted friend of my grandmother and mother who had baptised all the children at arlington the college opened yesterday and a fine set of youths about fifty made their appearance in a body it is supposed that many more will be coming during the month the scarcity of money everywhere embarrasses all proceedings general smith informs me that the military institute will commence its exercises on the 16th inst and that custis was unanimously elected to the chair of civil engineering the virginia military institute a state institution modelled after the u s military academy at west point was located in lexington and its grounds adjoined those of washington college since its foundation in 1839 unto this time general f h smith had been its superintendent i am living at the lexington hotel and he must come there if he comes up the ladies have furnished me a very nice room in the college for my office new carpet from baltimore curtains etc they are always doing something kind i came up september 30th from the baths annie and miss belle still there and very well they expect to be here on the 10th you tell me nothing of the girls i hope agnes is getting strong and fat i wished for them both at the baths annie and belle were my only companions i could not trespass upon them always the scenery is beautiful here but i fear it will be locked up in winter by the time you come nothing could be more beautiful than the mountains now most affectionately r e lee in addition to his duties as college president my father had to make all the arrangements for his new home the house assigned him by the college was occupied by dr madison who was to move out as soon as he could carpenters painters and glaziers had to be put to work to get it into condition furniture carpets bedding to be provided a cook procured servants and provisions supplied my mother was an invalid and absent and as my sisters were with her everything down to the minutest details was done by my fathers directions and under his superintendence he had always been noted for his care and attention to the little things and that trait apparent in him when a mere lad practised all through his busy and eventful life stood him in good stead now the difficulties to be overcome were made greater by the scarcity and inaccessibility of supplies and workmen and the smallness of his means in addition he conducted a large correspondence always answering every letter to every member of his family he wrote continually and was interested in all our pursuits advising and helping us as no one else could have done some of his letters to my mother at this time show how he looked into every matter great or small which related to her comfort and welfare and to the preparation of her new home for example on october 9th he writes life is indeed gliding away and i have nothing of good to show for mine that is past i pray i may be spared to accomplish something for the benefit of mankind and the honour of god i hope i may be able to get the house prepared for you in time to reach here before the cold weather dr madison has sent me word that he will vacate the house on the 16th inst this day week i will commence to make some outside repairs this week so as to get at the inside next and hope by the 1st of november it will be ready for you there is no furniture belonging to the house but we shall require but little to commence with mr green of alexandria to whom i had written says that his manufacturing machinery etc has been so much injured that although it has been returned to him he cannot resume operations until next year but that he will purchase for us anything we desire i believe nothing is manufactured in richmondeverything comes from the north and we might as well write to baltimore at once for what we want what do you think i believe nothing of consequence is manufactured here i will see this week what can be done and again a few days later he writes i hope you are all well and as comfortable as can be i am very anxious to get you all here but have made little progress in accomplishing it so far dr m expects to vacate the house this week but i fear it is not certain he can do so i engaged some carpenters last week to repair the roof fences stable etc but for want of material they could not make a commencement there is no lumber here at hand everything has to be prepared i have not been in the house yet but i hear there is much to be done we shall have to be patient as soon as it is vacated i will set to work i think it will be more expeditious and cheaper to write to renwick of baltimore to send what articles of furniture will be required and also to order some carpets from baltimore in a postscript dated the 17th he says the carpenters made a beginning on the house yesterday i hope it may be vacated this week i will prepare your room first the rest of us can bivouac love to all most affectionately r e lee on october 19th i have been over the house we are to occupy it is in wretched condition mrs m has not yet vacated it but i have some men at work though this storm has interrupted their operations and i fear little will be done this week i think i can make your room comfortable the upstairs is very convenient and the rest of the house sufficiently so i think you had better write at once to brit the brit mentioned here is mrs birtannia kennon of tudor place my mothers first cousin she had saved for us a great many of the household goods from arlington having gotten permission from the federal authorities to do so at the time it was occupied by their forces to send the curtains you speak of and the carpets it is better to use what we have than to buy others their use where originally intended arlington to that beloved home my mother still hoped to return is very uncertain they have been tossed about for four years and may be lost or ruined they can come by express to lynchburg and then up the canal or by richmond the merchants say the former is the best waymuch more expeditious and but little more expensive spending the summer on the pamunkey at the white house exposed all day in the fields to the sun and at night to the malaria from the river and marshes i became by the last of september one continuous chill so it was decided that as the corn was made the fodder saved the wheat land broken up and hands not so greatly needed i should get a furlough mounting my mare i started on a visit to my mother and sisters hoping that the change to the upper country would help me to get rid of the malaria when i reached derwent my father had gone to lexington but my mother and the rest were there to welcome me and dose me for my ailments there was still some discussion among us all as to what was the best thing for me to do and i wrote to my father telling him of my preference for a farmers life and my desire to work my own land the following letter which he wrote me in reply is like all i ever got from him full of love tenderness and good sensible advice my dear son i did not receive until yesterday your letter of the 8th inst i regret very much having missed seeing youstill more to hear that you have been suffering from intermittent fever i think the best thing you can do is to eradicate the disease from your system and unless there is some necessity for your returning to the white house you had better accompany your mother here i have thought very earnestly as to your future i do not know to what stage your education has been carried or whether it would be advantageous for you to pursue it further of that you can judge if you do and will apply yourself so as to get the worth of your money i can advance it to you for this year at least if you do not and wish to take possession of your farm i can assist you a little in that as matters now stand you could raise money on your farm only by mortgaging it which would put you in debt at the beginning of your life and i fear in the end would swallow up all your property as soon as i am restored to civil rights if i ever am i will settle up your grandfathers estate and put you in possession of your share the land may be responsible for some portion of his debts or legacies if so you will have to assume it in the meantime i think it would be better for you if you determine to farm your land to go down there as you propose and begin on a moderate scale i can furnish you means to buy a team wagon implements etc what will it cost if you cannot wait to accompany your mother here come up to see me and we can talk it over you could come up in the packet and return again if you do come ask agnes for my box of private papers i left with her and bring it with you but do not lose it for your life or we are all ruined wrap it up with your clothes and put it in a carpetbag or valise so that you can keep it with you or within your sight and do not call attention to it i am glad to hear that fitzhugh keeps so well and that he is prospering in his farming operations give him a great deal of love for me the first thing you must do is to get well your affectionate father r e lee his letters to his daughters tell in a playful way much of his life and are full of the quiet humor in which he so often indulged we were still at derwent awaiting the time when the house in lexington should be ready it had been decided that i should remain and accompany my mother and sisters to lexington and that some of us or all should go up the river to bremo the beautiful seat of dr charles cocke and pay a visit there before proceeding to lexington here is a letter from my father to his daughter mildred lexington october 29 1865 my precious life your nice letter gave me much pleasure and made me the more anxious to see you i think you girls after your mother is comfortable at bremo will have to come up and arrange the house for her reception you know i am a poor hand and can do nothing without your advice your brother too is wild for the want of admonition col blair is now his fidus achates and as he is almost as gray as your papa and wears the same uniform all gray he is sometimes taken for him by the young girls who consider your brother the most attentive of sons and giving good promise of making a desirable husband he will find himself married some of these days before he knows it you had better be near him i hope you give attention to robert miss sallie will thaw some of the ice from his heart tell her she must come up here as i want to see her badly i do not know what you will do with your chickens unless you take them to bremo and thus bring them here i suppose robert would not eat laura chilton and don ella mckay still less would he devour his sister mildred these were the names of some of my sisters pet chickens i have scarcely gotten acquainted with the young ladies they look very nice in the walks but i rarely get near them traveller is my only companion i may also say my pleasure he and i whenever practicable wander out in the mountains and enjoy sweet confidence the boys are plucking out his tail and he is presenting the appearance of a plucked chicken two of the belles of the neighborhood have recently been marriedmiss mattie jordan to dr cameron and miss rose cameron to dr sherod the former couple go to louisburg west virginia and start tomorrow on horseback the brides trousseau in a baggage wagon the latter to winchester miss sherod one of the bridesmaids said she knew you there i did not attend the weddings but have seen the pairs of doves both of the brides are remarkable in this county of equestrianism for their good riding and beauty with true affection your fond father r e lee to his daughter agnes about the same time he writes lexington virginia october 26 1865 my dear agnes i will begin the correspondence of the day by thanking you for your letter of the 9th it will i am sure be to me intellectually what my mornings feast is corporeally it will strengthen me for the day and smooth the rough points which constantly protrude in my epistles i am glad robert is with you it will be a great comfort to him and i hope in addition will dissipate his chills he can also accompany you in your walks and rides and be that silent sympathy for he is a man of few words which is so soothing though marble to women he is so only externally and you will find him warm and cheering tell him i want him to go to see miss francis galt i think her smile will awake some sweet music in him and be careful to take precautions against the return of the chills on the 7th 14th and 21st days i want very much to have you all with me again and miss you dreadfully i hope another month will accomplish it in the meantime you must get very well this is a beautiful spot by natureman has done but little for it love to all most affectionately your father r e lee about the first week of november we all went by canalboat to bremo some twentyfive miles up the james river where we remained the guests of doctor and mrs charles cocke until we went to lexington my sister agnes while there was invited to richmond to assist at the wedding of a very dear friend miss sally warwick she wrote my father asking his advice and approval and received this reply so characteristic of his playful humorous mood lexington virginia november 16 1865 my precious little agnes i have just received your letter of the 13th and hasten to reply it is very hard for you to apply to me to advise you to go away from me you know how much i want to see you and how important you are to me but in order to help you to make up your mind if it will promote your pleasure and sallys happiness i will say go you may inform sally from me however that no preparations are necessary and if they were no one could help her she has just got to wade through it as if it was an attack of measles or anything elsenaturally as she would not marry custis she may marry whom she chooses i shall wish her every happiness just the same for she knows nobody loves her as much as i do i do not think upon reflection she will consider it right to refuse my son and take away my daughter she need not tell me whom she is going to marry i suppose it is some cross old widower with a dozen children she will not be satisfied at her sacrifice with less and i should think that would be cross sufficient i hope life is not going to desert us too and when are we to see you i have received your mothers letter announcing her arrival at bremo tell your mother however to come when she chooses and when most to her comfort and convenience she can come to the hotel where i am and stay until the house is ready there is no difficulty in that and she can be very comfortable my rooms are up on the 3d floor and her meals can be sent to her tell rob the chills will soon leave him now mrs cocke will cure him give much love to your mamma mildred rob and all at bremo your affectionate father r e lee miss agnes lee colonel ellis president of the james river and kanawha canal company placed at my mothers disposal his private boat which enabled her to reach bremo with great ease and comfort and when she was ready to go to lexington the same boat was again given her it was well fitted up with sleeping accommodations carried a cook and had a diningroom it corresponded to the private car of the present railroad magnate and though not so sumptuous was more roomy and comfortable when provisions became scarce we purchased fresh supplies from any farmhouse near the canalbank tied up at night and made about four miles an hour during the day it was slow but sure and no mode of travel even at the present day could have suited my mother better she was a great invalid from rheumatism and had to be lifted whenever she moved when put in her wheelchair she could propel herself on a level floor or could move about her room very slowly and with great difficulty on her crutches but she was always bright sunnytempered and uncomplaining constantly occupied with her books letters knitting and painting for the last of which she had a great talent on november 20th my father writes to her from lexington i was very glad to hear by your letter of the 11th of your safe arrival at bremo i feel very grateful to col ellis for his thoughtful consideration in sending you in his boat as you made the journey in so much more comfort it is indeed sad to be removed from our kind friends at oakland who seemed never to tire of contributing to our convenience and pleasure and who even continue their kindness at this distance just as the room which i had selected for you was finished i received the accompanying note from mrs cocke to which i responded and thanked her in your name placing the room at her disposal the paint is hardly dry yet but will be ready this week to receive the furniture if completed i know no more about it than is contained in her note i was also informed last night that a very handsome piano had been set up in the house brought from baltimore by the maker as a present from his firm or some friends i have not seen it or the maker this is an article of furniture that we might well dispense with under present circumstances though i am equally obliged to those whose generosity prompted its bestowal tell mildred i shall now insist on her resuming her music and in addition to her other labours she must practise seven hours a day on the piano until she becomes sufficiently proficient to play agreeably to herself and others and promptly and gracefully whenever invited i think we should enjoy all the amenities of life that are within our reach and which have been provided for us by our heavenly father i am sorry rob has a return of his chills but he will soon lose them now ask miss mary to disperse them she is very active and energetic they cannot stand before her i hope agnes has received my letter and that she has made up her mind to come up to her papa tell her there are plenty of weddings here if she likes those things there is to be one tuesdaymiss mamie williamson to captain eoff beverley turner is to be married the same night to miss rose skinker and sweet margaret will also leave us if they go at three a night there will soon be none of our acquaintances left i told agnes to tell you to come up whenever most convenient to you if the house is habitable i will take you there if not will bring you to the hotel i wish i could take advantage of this fine weather to perform the journey photographs and autographs in demandthe generals interest in young peoplehis happy home lifelabours at washington collegehe gains financial aid for itworsleys translation of homer dedicated to himtributes from other english scholars the people of virginia and of the entire south were continually giving evidence of their intense love for general lee from all nations even from the northern states came to him marks of admiration and respect just at this time he received many applications for his photograph with autograph attached i believe there were none of the little things in life so irksome to him as having his picture taken in any way but when able to comply he could not refuse to do what was asked of him by those who were willing and anxious to do so much for him in the following letter the photographs referred to had been sent to him for his signature from a supply that my mother generally kept on hand she was often asked for them by those who very considerately desired to save my father the trouble lexington november 21 1865 my dear mary i have just received your letter of the 17th and return the photographs with my signatures i wrote to you by the boat of yesterday morning i also sent you a packet of letters by captain wilkinson commander of the canal packet which also ought to have reached you today i have nothing to add to my former letters and only write now that you may receive the photos before you leave i answered agnes letter immediately and inclosed her several letters i was in hopes she had made up her mind to eschew weddings and stick to her pap i do not think she can help little sallie besides she will not take the oathhow can she get married the wedding party from this place go down in the boat tonight to lynchburgmiss williamson and captain eoff they are to be married in church at eight p m and embark at eleven i wish them a pleasant passage and am glad i am not of the party the scenery along the river will no doubt be cheering and agreeable i think the repairs of the house will be completed this week should the furniture arrive it will be habitable next the weather is still beautiful which is in our favour i am glad caroline is so promising i have engaged no servant here yet nor have i found one to my liking we can get some of some kind and do better when we can i have heard nothing of the wedding at belmead and do not think preston will go mrs cocke is very well but the furniture she intends for your room is not yet completed it will be more comfortable and agreeable to you to go at once to the house on your arrival but if there is anything to make it more desirable for you to come before the house is ready you must come to the hotel if we could only get comfortable weather in december it would be better not to go into the house until it is dry the paint hard etc it will require all this week to get the wood done then it must be scoured etc and the furniture properly arranged tell rob he will soon be well he must cheer up and come and see his papa give my love to mrs cocke miss mary etc etc tell agnes if she thinks sallie is in extremis to go to her i do not want her to pass away but it is a great disappointment to me not to have her with me i am getting very old and infirm now and she had better come to her papa and take care of him most affectionately yours r e lee mrs m c lee my father was always greatly interested in the love affairs of his relatives friends and acquaintances his letters during the war show this in very many ways one would suppose that the general commanding an army in active operations could not find the time even to think of such trifles much less to write about them but he knew of very many such affairs among his officers and even his men and would on occasion refer to them before the parties themselves very much to their surprise and discomfiture bishop peterkin of west virginia who served on the staff of general pendleton tells me of the following instances in illustration of this characteristic it was in the winter of 18634 when we were camped near orange court house that meeting the general after i had come back from a short visit to richmond he asked after my father and then said did you see miss and i replied no sir i did not then again did you see miss and when i still replied no he added with a smile how exceedingly busy you must have been againat the cavalry review at brandy station on june 8 1863we had galloped all around the lines when the general took his post for the march past and all the staff in attendance grouped themselves about him there being no special orders about our positions i got pretty near the general i noticed that several times he turned and looked toward an ambulance near us filled with young girls at at last after regiments and brigades had gone by the horse artillery came up the general turned and finding me near him said go and tell that young lady with the blue ribbon in her hat that suchandsuch a battery is coming i rode up and saluted the young lady there was great surprise shown by the entire party as i was not known to any of them and when i came out with my message there was a universal shout while the general looked on with a merry twinkle in his eye it was evidently the following up on his part of some joke which he had with the young lady about an officer in this battery my mother had arranged to start for lexington on november 28th via the canal but for some reason was prevented on that day in his next letter my father who was most anxious that she should make the journey before the bad weather set in expresses his disappointment at not finding her on the packet on the expected morning lexington virginia november 20 1865 my dear mary i am much disappointed that you did not arrive on the boat last night and as you had determined when you wrote saturday the 25th to take the boat as it passed tuesday i fear you were prevented either by the indisposition of yourself or of roberts i shall however hope that it was owing to some less distressing cause our room is all ready and looks remarkably nice mrs cocke in her great kindness seems to have provided everything for it that you require and you will have nothing to do but to take possession the ladies have also arranged the other rooms as far as the furniture will allow they have put down the carpets in the parlour diningroom and two chambers upstairs and have put furniture in one room they have also put up the curtains in the rooms downstairs and put a table and chairs in the diningroom we have therefore everything which is required for living as soon as the crockery etc arrives from derwent of which as yet i have heard nothing neither has the furniture from baltimore arrived and the season is so far advanced that we may be deprived of that all winter but with what we now have if we can get that from derwent we shall do very well there is some report of the packets between this place and lynchburg being withdrawn from the line which renders me more uneasy about your journey up this is a bright and beautiful morning and there is no indication of a change of weather but the season is very uncertain and snow and ice may be upon us any day i think you had better come now the first opportunity do not take the boat which passes bremo saturday it reaches lynchburg sunday morning arriving here monday night you would in that case have to lie at the wharf at lynchburg all day sunday i have heard of agnes arrival in richmond and shall be happy to have precious life write me again i have engaged a man for the balance of the year who professes to know everything he can at least make up fires and go on errands and attend to the yard and stable i have heard nothing of jimmy give my kind regards to all at bremo custis is well and went to the boat to meet you this morning the boat stops one and onequarter miles from town remain aboard until we come most affectionately yours r e lee pssince writing the foregoing i have received your letter of the 28th i shall expect you saturday morning r e l mrs m c lee at this time the packetboat from lynchburg to lexington via the james river and kanawha canal was the easiest way of reaching lexington from the outside world it was indeed the only way except by stage from goshen twentyone miles distant a station of the chesapeake ohio r r the canal ran from lynchburg to richmond and just after the war did a large business the boats were very uncertain in their schedules and my father was therefore very particular in his directions to my mother to insure her as far as he could a comfortable journey my father was not aware when he wrote such explicit directions about the route that colonel ellis had again put his boat at my mothers service we did get off at last and after a very comfortable trip arrived at lexington on the morning of december 2d my father on traveller was there to meet us and putting us all in a carriage escorted us to our new home on arriving we found awaiting us a delicious breakfast sent by mrs nelson the wife of professor nelson the house was in good orderthanks to the ladies of lexingtonbut rather bare of furniture except my mothers rooms mrs cocke had completely furnished them and her loving thoughtfulness had not forgotten the smallest detail mrs margaret j preston the talented and wellknown poetess had drawn the designs for the furniture and a onearmed confederate soldier had made it all a handsomely carved grand piano presented by stieff the famous maker of baltimore stood alone in the parlour the floors were covered with the carpets rescued from arlingtonmuch too large and folded under to suit the reduced size of the rooms some of the bedrooms were partially furnished and the diningroom had enough in it to make us very comfortable we were all very grateful and happyglad to get homethe only one we had had for four long years my father appeared bright and even gay he was happy in seeing us all and in knowing that my mother was comfortably established near to him he showed us over the house and pointed with evident satisfaction to the goodly array of pickles preserves and brandypeaches which our kind neighbors had placed in the storeroom indeed for days and weeks afterward supplies came pouring in to my mother from the people in the town and country even from the poor mountaineers who anxious to do something to help general lee brought in handbags of walnuts potatoes and game such kindnessdelicate and considerate alwaysas was shown to my fathers family by the people both of the town and the country around not only then but to this day has never been surpassed in any community it was a tribute of love and sympathy from honest and tender hearts to the man who had done all that he could do for them my father was much interested in all the arrangements of the house even to the least thing he would laugh merrily over the difficulties that appalled the rest of us our servants were few and unskilled but his patience and selfcontrol never failed the silver of the family had been sent to lexington for safekeeping early in the war when general hunger raided the valley of virginia and advanced upon lexington to remove temptation out of his way this silver in two large chests had been intrusted to the care of the old and faithful sergeant at the virginia military institute and he had buried it in some safe place known only to himself i was sent out with him to dig it up and bring it in we found it safe and sound but black with mould and damp useless for the time being so my father opened his campchest and we used his forks spoons plates etc while his campstools supplied the deficiency in seats he often teased my sisters about their experiments in cookery and household arts encouraging them to renewed efforts after lamentable failures when they succeeded in a dish for the table or completed any garment with their own hands he was lavish with his praise he would say you are all very helpless i dont know what you will do when i am gone and if you want to be missed by your friendsbe useful he at once set to work to improve all around him laid out a vegetable garden planted roses and shrubs set out fruit and yard trees made new walks and repaired the stables so that in a short time we were quite comfortable and very happy he at last had a home of his own with his wife and daughters around him and though it was not the little farm in the quiet country for which he had so longed it was very near to it and it gave rest to himself and those he loved most dearly his duties as president of washington college were far from light his time was fully occupied and his new position did not relieve him from responsibility care and anxiety he took pains to become acquainted with each student personally to be really his guide and friend their success gratified and pleased him and their failures in any degree pained and grieved him and their failures in any degree pained and grieved him he felt that he was responsible for their welldoing and progress and he worked very hard to make them good students and useful men the grounds and buildings of the college soon began to show his care attention and good taste in all his life wherever he happened to be he immediately set to work to better his surroundings the sites selected for his headquarter camps during the war if occupied for more than a day showed his tasteful touch when superintendent at west point the improvements suggested and planned by him were going on for the three years he remained there very soon after he assumed charge of arlington the place showed in its improved condition the effects of his energetic industry the college at lexington was a splendid field for the exercise of his abilities in this line the neighbouring virginia military institute soon followed the example he had set and after a year the municipal authorities of lexington were aroused to the necessity of bettering their streets and sidewalks and its inhabitants realised the need of improving and beautifying their homes he managed a very large correspondence answering every letter when possible the greater proportion with his own hand to the members of his own family who were away he wrote regularly and was their best correspondent on home matters telling in his charming way all the sayings and doings of the household and the neighbours my sister agnes had gone to the wedding of miss warwick direct from bremo and was in richmond when my father sent her two of the first letters he wrote after the arrival of my mother in lexington lexington virginia december 5 1865 my worrying little agnes your letter of the 1st received tonight i have autographed the photographs and send a gross of the latter and a lock of hair present my love to the recipients and thank them for their favours sally is going to marry a widower i think i ought to know as she refused my son and i do not wish to know his name i wonder if she knows how many children he has tell mr warwick i am sorry for him i do not know what he will do without his sweet daughter nor do i know what i will do without her either your mother has writtenmildred tooand i presume has told you all domestic news custis is promenading the floor rob reading the papers and mildred packing her dress your mamma is up to her eyes in news and i am crabbed as usual i miss you very much and hope this is the last wedding you will attend goodbye love to everybody your affectionate father r e lee miss agnes lee the other is dated nearly a month later and from this it appears that the wedding so often referred to is about to take place lexington virginia january 3 1866 my precious little agnes i sat down to give my dear little sallyfor she is dear to me in the broadest highest sense of the wordthe benefit of jeremy taylors opinion on hasty marriages but on reflection i fear it would be words lost for your mother says her experience has taught her that when a young woman makes up her mind to get married you might as well let her alone you must therefore just thank her for the pretty inkstand and say that ill need no reminder of her but i do not know when i shall make up my mind to stain it with ink i was very glad to receive your letter of the 26th and to think that you were mindful of us i know you do not wish to be away though you are striving to get as far away as possible when you reach norfolk you will be so convenient to new york whence steamers depart almost daily for europe let us know when you sail but i do not write to restrain your movements though you know how solitary i am without you i inclosewhich with what i gave mildred i hope will answer your purpose send me or bring me the photographs i asked for i like them of the last edition they seem to take with the little schoolgirls and i have nothing else to give them i hope you will have a safe and pleasant trip tell mr warwick i shall sorrow with him tonightthough i believe mrs lee is right remember me to all friends and believe me your devoted father r e lee miss agnes lee the latter part of january my father was sent by the board of trustees to richmond to converse with the committee on education of the virginia legislature then in session as to some funds of the state held by washington college his mission was i believe successful and great material aid was gained he remained no long than was absolutely necessary and returning to his duties at lexington encountered a severe snowstorm the difficulties he had to overcome are described in the following letter to his daughter agnes whom he had met in richmond and who had gone from there to visit some friends in norfolk lexington virginia january 29 1866 my precious little agnes i have received your letter of the 17th transmitting the photographs for which i am very much obliged i returned the one for miss laura lippett whom i wish i could see once again it would be more agreeable to me than any photograph i had quite a successful journey up notwithstanding the storm the snow increased as we approached the mountains and night had set in before we reached staunton the next morning before sunrise in spite of the predictions of the wise ones i took passage on the single car which was attached to the locomotive and arrived at goshen about 10 a m where after some little encouragement the stagedriver attached his horses to the stage and we started slowly through the mountains breaking the track on reaching the baths the north river was unfordable but i was ferried across in a skiff with all my bundles i picked up two more in staunton and one at goshen and packages and took a stage detained on the opposite bank for lexington where i arrived in good time i found all as well as usual and disappointed at not seeing you with me though i was not expected i told them how anxious you were to come with me and how you wanted to see them but that you looked so wretchedly i could not encourage you i hope you are now in norfolk and that the fish and oysters will fatten you and cure your feet but get strong and keep well and do not wear yourself out in the pursuit of pleasure i hope you will soon join us and that lexington may prove to you a happy home your mother is a great sufferer but is as quiet and uncomplaining as ever mildred is active and cheerful and custis and i as silent as our wont major campbell brown is here on a visit i am surprised to find him such a talker i am very sorry to find that preston cocke has been obliged to leave on account of his health i have one comfort my dear nephew will never injure himself by studying do not be alarmed about him remember me to colonel taylor all his mothers family his wife the bakers seldens etc i know none of the latter but the doctor for whom i have always had a great esteem your mother brother and mildred send their best love and kindest wishes i am always your devoted father r e lee miss agnes lee it was at dr seldons house that my sister was visiting he had been very kind in offering assistance to my father and mother i remember well the supper given me and several of my comrades when we were coming back from the surrender and while the doctor and his family were refugees at liberty now bedford city va stopping there one night weary and hungry while looking for quarters for man and beast i got a note asking me and my friends to come to their house an invitation of that kind was never refused in those days we went and were treated as if we had been sons of the house the young ladies themselves waiting on us in the morning when we were about to start they filled our haversacks with rations and mrs selden taking me aside offered me a handful of gold pieces saying that she had more and that she could not bear to think of my fathers son being without as long as she possessed any the love and devotion shown my father by all the people of the south was deeply appreciated by him he longed to help them but was almost powerless i think he felt that something could be done in that direction by teaching and training their youth and i am sure this idea greatly influenced him in deciding to accept the presidency of washington college the advantages to the south of a proper education of her youth were very evident to him he strongly urged it wherever and whenever he could in a letter written at this time to the reverend g w leyburn he speaks very forcibly on the subject so greatly have those interests educational been disturbed at the south and so much does its future condition depend upon the rising generation that i consider the proper education of its youth one of the most important objects now to be attained and one from which the greatest benefits may be expected nothing will compensate us for the depression of the standard of our moral and intellectual culture and each state should take the most energetic measures to revive the schools and colleges and if possible to increase the facilities for instruction and to elevate the standard of learning again in a letter to general john b gordon written december 1867 he says the thorough education of all classes of the people is the most efficacious means in my opinion of promoting the prosperity of the south the material interests of its citizens as well as their moral and intellectual culture depend upon its accomplishment the textbooks of our schools therefore should not only be clear systematic and scientific but they should be acceptable to parents and pupils in order to enlist the minds of all in the subjects in a letter to a friend in baltimore he is equally earnest i agree with you fully as to the importance of a more practical course of instruction in our schools and colleges which calling forth the genius and energies of our people will tend to develop the resources and promote the interests of the country in many other letters at this time and later on especially in one to professor minor who had been appointed with him upon a board by the educational society of virginia did he urge the importance of education for the present and future safety welfare and prosperity of the country among the many tokens of respect and admiration love and sympathy which my father received from all over the world there was one that touched him deeply it was a translation of homers iliad by philip stanhope worsley fellow of corpus christi college oxford england which the talented young poet and author sent him through the generals nephew mr edward lee childe of paris a special friend of mr worsley i copy the latters letter to mr childe as it shows some of the motives influencing him in the dedication of his work my dear friend you will allow me in dedicating this work to you to offer it at the same time as a poor yet not altogether unmeaning tribute of my reverence for your brave and illustrious uncle general lee he is the hero like hector of the iliad of the most glorious cause for which men fight and some of the grandest passages in the poem come to me with yet more affecting power when i remember his lofty character and undeserved misfortunes the great names that your country has bequeathed from its four lurid years of national life as examples to mankind can never be forgotten and among these none will be more honoured while history endures by all true hears than that of your noble relative i need not say more for i know you must be aware how much i feel the honour of associating my work however indirectly with one whose goodness and genius are alike so admirable accept this token of my deepest sympathy and regard and believe me ever most sincerely yours p s worsley on the flyleaf of the volume he sent my father was written the following beautiful inscription his letter of thanks and the one which he wrote later when he heard of the ill health of mr worsleyboth of which i give hereshow very plainly how much he was pleased lexington virginia february 10 1866 mr p s worsley my dear sir i have received the copy of your translation of the iliad which you so kindly presented to me its perusal has been my evenings recreation and i have never more enjoyed the beauty and grandeur of the poem than as recited by you the translation is as truthful as powerful and faithfully represents the imagery and rhythm of the bold original the undeserved compliment in prose and verse on the first leaves of the volume i received as your tribute to the merit of my countrymen who struggled for constitutional government with great respect your obedient servant r e lee lexington virginia march 14 1866 my dear mr worsley in a letter just received from my nephew mr childe i regret to learn that at his last accounts from you you were greatly indisposed so great is my interest in your welfare that i cannot refrain even at the risk of intruding upon your sickroom from expressing my sincere sympathy in your affliction i trust however that ere this you have recovered and are again in perfect health like many of your tastes and pursuits i fear you may confine yourself too closely to your reading less mental labour and more of the fresh air of heaven might bring to you more comfort and to your friends more enjoyment even in the way in which you now delight them should a visit to this distracted country promise you any recreation i hope i need not assure you how happy i should be to see you at lexington i can give you a quiet room and careful nursing and a horse that would delight to carry you over our beautiful mountains i hope my letter informing you of the pleasure i derived from the perusal of your translation of the iliad in which i endeavoured to express my thanks for the great compliment you paid me in its dedication has informed you of my high appreciation of the work wishing you every happiness in this world and praying that eternal peace may be your portion in that to come i am most truly your friend and servant r e lee that winter my father was accustomed to read aloud in the long evenings to my mother and sisters the grand old bard equally to his own and his listeners enjoyment two or three years after this professor george long of england a distinguished scholar sent my father a copy of the second edition of his thoughts of the emperor marcus aurelius the first edition of this translation was pirated by a northern publisher who dedicated the book back to emerson this made long very indignant and he immediately brought out a second edition with the following prefatory note i have never dedicated a book to any man and if i dedicated this i should choose the man whose name seemed to me most worthy to be joined to that of the roman soldier and philosopher i might dedicate the book to the successful general who is now the president of the united states with the hope that his integrity and justice will restore peace and happiness so far as he can to those unhappy states which have suffered so much from war and the unrelenting hostility of wicked men but as the roman poet says victrix causa deis placuit sed victa catoni and if i dedicated this little book to any man i would dedicate it to him who led the confederate armies against the powerful invader and retired from an unequal contest defeated but not dishonoured to the noble virginian soldier whose talents and virtues place him by the side of the best and wisest man who sat on the throne of the imperial caesars these two nearly similar tributes came from the best cultured thought of england and the london standard speaking more for the nation at large says a country which has given birth to men like him and those who followed him may look the chivalry of europe in the face without shame for the fatherlands of sidney and bayard never produced a nobler soldier gentleman and christian than general robert e lee in a letter to his old friend mr h tutweiler of virginia professor long sent the following message to my father which however was never received by him it having been sent to my mother only after his death i did not answer general lees letter one of thanks for the book sent by professor long through mr tutweiler because i thought that he is probably troubled with many letters if you should have occasion to write to him i beg you will present to him my most respectful regards and my hope that he will leave behind him some commentary to be placed on the same shelf with caesars i am afraid he is too modest to do this i shall always keep general lees letter and will leave it to somebody who will cherish the remembrance of a great soldier and a good man if i were not detained here by circumstances i would cross the atlantic to see the first and noblest man of our days another noble english gentleman who had shown great kindness to the south and who was a warm admirer of general lee was the honorable a w beresford hope he i think was at the head of a number of english gentlemen who presented the superb statue of stonewall jackson by foley to the state of virginia it now stands in the capitol square at richmond and is a treasure of which the whole commonwealth may justly be proud through mr hope my father received a handsome copy of the bible and in acknowledgement of mr hopes letter he wrote the following lexington virginia april 16 1866 honourable a w beresford hope bedgebury park kent england sir i have received within a few days your letter of november 14 1865 and had hoped that by this time it would have been followed by the copy of the holy scriptures to which you refer that i might have known the generous donors whose names you state are inscribed on its pages its failure to reach me will i fear deprive me of that pleasure and i must ask the favour of you to thank them most heartily for their kindness in providing me with a book in comparison with which all others in my eyes are of minor importance and which in all my perplexities has never failed to give me light and strength your assurance of the esteem in which i am held by a large portion of the british nation as well as by those for whom you speak is most grateful to my feelings though i am aware that i am indebted to their generous natures and not to my own merit for their good opinion i beg sir that you will accept my sincere thanks for the kind sentiments which you have expressed toward me and my unfeigned admiration of your exalted character i am with great respect your most obedient servant r e lee his intention to write the history of his virginia campaignscalled before a committee of congresspreaches patience and silence in the southshuns controversy and publicitycorresponds with an englishman herbert c saunders my father had a strong desire at this time to write a history of his campaigns i think however he gradually gave it up when he saw the great difficulties to be overcome and the labour required to produce anything worthy of the subject especially as he began to realise that his strength was slowly failinga fact which his letters indicate just after the cessation of hostilities he had taken some preliminary steps toward acquiring the necessary material in a circular letter which he sent out to a great many of his general officers he wrote i am desirous that the bravery and devotion of the army of northern virginia be correctly transmitted to posterity this is the only tribute that can now be paid to the worth of its noble officers and soldiers and i am anxious to collect the necessary information for the history of its campaigns including the operations in the valley and in western virginia from its organisation to its final surrender in a letter to the honourable w b reid of philadelphia he writes on the same subject i concur with you entirely as to the importance of a true history of the war and it is my purpose unless prevented to write the history of the campaigns in virginia with this view i have been engaged since the cessation of hostilities in endeavouring to procure the necessary official information all my records reports returns etc etc with the headquarters of the army were needlessly destroyed by the clerks having them in charge on the retreat from petersburg and such as had been forwarded to the war department in richmond were either destroyed in the conflagration or captured at the south in the attempt to save them i desire to obtain some vouchers in support of my memory or i should otherwise have made some progress in the narrative they have not even my letter or orderbooks to which to refer i have thought it possible that some of my official correspondence which would be of value to me might be found among the captured records in washington and that general grant who possesses magnanimity as well as ability might cause me to be furnished with copies i have however hesitated to approach him on the subject as it is one in which he would naturally feel no interest in a letter to general early written in november 1865 on the same subject he says i desire if not prevented to write a history of the campaigns in virginia your reports of your operations in 64 and 65 were among those destroyed can not you repeat them and send me copies of such letters orders etc of mine including that last letter to which you refer and particularly give me your recollections of our effective strength at the principal battles my only object is to transmit if possible the truth to posterity and do justice to our brave soldiers here is another letter to general early written march 16th containing references to the same subject and to two letters of general early which had been published in the papers it is interesting also as showing his moderation in speaking of those who had misrepresented his words and acts my dear general i am very much obliged to you for the copies of my letters forwarded with yours of january 25th i hope you will be able to send me reports of the operations of your commands in the campaign from the wilderness to richmond at lynchburg in the valley maryland etc all statistics as regards numbers destruction of private property by the federal troops etc i should like to have as i wish my memory strengthened on these points it will be difficult to get the world to understand the odds against which we fought and the destruction or loss of all returns of the army embarrass me very much i read your letter from havana to the new york times and was pleased with the temper in which it was written i have since received the paper containing it published in the city of mexico and also your letter in reference to mr davis i understand and appreciate the motives which prompted both letters and think they will be of service in the way you intended i have been much pained to see the attempts made to cast odium upon mr davis but do not think they will be successful with the reflecting or informed portion of the country the accusations against myself i have not thought proper to notice or even to correct misrepresentations of my words or acts we shall have to be patient and suffer for awhile at least and all controversy i think will only serve to prolong angry and bitter feeling and postpone the period when reason and charity may resume their sway at present the public mind is not prepared to receive the truth the feelings which influenced you to leave the country were natural and i presume were uppermost in the breasts of many it was a matter which each one had to decide for himself as he only could know the reasons which governed him i was particularly anxious on your account as i had the same apprehensions to which you refer i am truly glad that you are beyond the reach of annoyance and hope you may be able to employ yourself profitably and usefully mexico is a beautiful country fertile of vast resources and with a stable government and virtuous population will rise to greatness i do not think that your letters can be construed by your former associates as reflecting upon them and i have never heard the least blame cast by those who have remained upon those who thought it best to leave the country i think i stated in a former letter the reasons which governed me and will not therefore repeat them i hope in time peace will be restored to the country and that the south may enjoy some measure of prosperity i fear however much suffering is still in store for her and that her people must be prepared to exercise fortitude and forbearance i must beg you to present my kind regards to the gentlemen with you and with my best wishes for yourself and undiminished esteem i am most truly yours r e lee that his purpose had been heard of in the outside world is evident from this reply to a publisher in cincinnati near cartersville virginia august 26 1865 mr joseph topham cincinnati ohio my dear sir i have just received your letter of the 17th inst in reference to a history of the late war to be written by myself i cannot at present undertake such a work but am endeavouring to collect certain material to enable me to write a history of the campaigns in virginia its completion is uncertain and dependent upon so many contingencies that i think it useless to speak of arrangements for its publication at present thanking you for your kind proposition i am very respectfully yours r e lee there were a great many letters of this kind from northern publishing houses and his replies were all of the same character his failure to carry out this much cherished wish is greatly to be deplored how much we and our children have missed those who know his truth and honesty of purpose his manliness simplicity and charity can best tell during the last days of february he was summoned to washington to appear before a committee of congress which was inquiring into the conditions of things in the southern states with a view to passing some of the socalled reconstruction measures his testimony was simple direct and dignified and is well worth reading by all who wish to hear the plain truth it was his first appearance in any city save richmond since the war and being at a time of such political excitement his visit was an occasion of absorbing interest to the crowds then in the capital when in washington armanda one of the houseservants at arlington called on him but failed to see him in answer to a letter from her my father replies as follows lexington virginia march 9 1866 amanda parks amanda i have received your letter of the 27th ult and regret very much that i did not see you when i was in washington i heard on returning to my room sunday night that you had been to see me and i was sorry to have missed you for i wished to learn how you were and how all the people from arlington were getting on in the world my interest in them is as great now as it ever was and i sincerely wish for their happiness and prosperity at the period specified in mr custiss willfive years from the time of his deathi caused the liberation of all the people at arlington as well as those at the white house and romancoke to be recorded in the hustings court at richmond and letters of manumission to be given to those with whom i could communicate who desired them in consequence of the war which then existed i could do nothing more for them i do not know why you should ask if i am angry with you i am not aware of your having done anything to give me offense and i hope you would not say or do what was wrong while you lived at arlington you behaved very well and were attentive and faithful to your duties i hope you will always conduct yourself in the same manner wishing you health happiness and success in life i am truly r e lee shortly after his return to lexington he writes to mrs jefferson davis in this letter he expresses such noble sentiments and is so moderate and sensible in his views of those who were harassing him and the south that all who read it must profit thereby lexington virginia february 23 1866 my dear mrs davis your letter of the 12th inst reached lexington during my absence at washington i have never seen mr colfaxs speech and am therefore ignorant of the statements it contained had it however come under my notice i doubt whether i should have thought it proper to reply i have thought from the time of the cessation of the hostilities that silence and patience on the part of the south was the true course and i think so still controversy of all kinds will in my opinion only serve to continue excitement and passion and will prevent the public mind from the acknowledgement and acceptance of the truth these considerations have kept me from replying to accusations made against myself and induced me to recommend the same to others as regards the treatment of the andersonville prisoners to which you allude i know nothing and can say nothing of my own knowledge i never had anything to do with any prisoners except to send those taken on the fields where i was engaged to the provost marshal general at richmond i have felt most keenly the sufferings and imprisonment of your husband and have earnestly consulted with friends as to any possible mode of affording him relief and consolation he enjoys the sympathy and respect of all good men and if as you state his trial is now near the exhibition of the while truth in his case will i trust prove his defense and justification with sincere prayers for his health and speedy restoration to liberty and earnest supplications to god that he may take you and yours under his guidance and protection i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee in further illustration of these views held so strongly by him and practised so faithfully throughout his life the following written to a gentleman in baltimore is given lexington virginia april 13 1866 my dear sir your letter of the 5th inst inclosing a slip from the baltimore american has been received the same statement has been published at the north for several years the statement is not true but i have not thought proper to publish a contradiction being unwilling to be drawn into a newspaper discussion believing that those who know me would not credit it and those who do not would care nothing about it i cannot now depart from the rule i have followed it is so easy to make accusations against the people at the south upon similar testimony that those so disposed should one be refuted will immediately create another and thus you would be led into endless controversy i think it better to leave their correction to the return of reason and good feeling thanking you for your interest in my behalf and begging you to consider my letter as intended only for yourself i am most respectfully your obedient servant r e lee in this connection i give the following letter thanking mr burr for a copy of the old guard which he had sent him and showing also what in his opinion the south had fought for and of what true republicanism consists lexington virginia january 5 1866 mr c chauncey burr my dear sir i am very much obliged to you for your letter of the 27th ult and for the number of the old guard which you kindly sent me i am glad to know that the intelligent and respectable people at the north are true and conservative in their opinions for i believe by no other course can the right interests of the country be maintained all that the south has ever desired was that the union as established by our forefathers should be preserved and that the government as originally organised should be administered in purity and truth if such is the desire of the north there can be no contention between the two sections and all true patriots will unite in advocating that policy which will soonest restore the country to tranquility and order and serve to perpetuate true republicanism please accept my thanks for your advocacy of right and liberty and the kind sentiments which you express toward myself and believe me to be with great respect your obedient servant r e lee an interesting view of my fathers desire to keep himself from public attention is shown by his correspondence with an english gentleman mr herbert c saunders the connected interview states his opinions on several points which are valuable the copy of these papers was kindly furnished me by mr john lyle campbell the proctor of washington and lee university washington and lee university lexington virginia january 19 1900 capt robert e lee west point virginia dear capt lee i inclose the copy promised you of the papers found in general lees desk the paper seems to have had his careful revision as there are a good many passages stricken out and a good many insertions in what seems to me undoubtedly to be his handwriting and i was very much interested in the changes that he made as they were most characteristic of himtoning everything down striking out adjectives turning phrases from a personal to a general character and always adding simplicity and force to the original it seems to me most likely that he was a first disposed to allow the publication but declined at last on august 22d the full limit of time indicated in mr saunderss letter i am yours truly dict jno l campbell the papers of which the following are copies were found in general robert e lees desk in the presidents office at washington and lee university on the envelope in which they were inclosed was the following indorsement in general lees handwriting london july 31 1866 herbert c sanders asks permission to publish his conversation with me august 22drefused 3 bolton gardens south kensington london july 31 1866 my dear general lee presuming on the acquaintance with you which i had the honour and pleasure of making last november at lexington while travelling in virginia i venture now to write to you under these circumstances you may remember that at the time i presented to you my letter of introduction i told you that two other englishmen friends of mine who had come with me to america were then making a tour through georgia the carolinas and some other southern states one of them mr kennaway was so much interested with all he saw and the people at home have appreciated his letters descriptive of it so well that he is intending to publish a short account of his visit not having however had an introduction to yourself he is anxious to avail himself of the somewhat full accounts i wrote home at the time descriptive of my most interesting interview with you and with this view he has asked me to put into the shape of a letter all those more prominent points which occur to me as gathered from my letters and my recollection and which are likely to interest and instruct the english public i have after some hesitation acceded to the requesta hesitation caused mainly by the fact that at the time i saw you i neither prepared my notes with a view to publication nor did i inform you that there was any chance of what you told me being repeated i may add that i never until a month or two ago had the slightest thought of publishing anything and in fact have constantly resisted the many applications by my friends that i should let my letters see the light my object in now writing to you is to know whether you have any objection to my giving my friend the inclosed short account of our interview as it would i am convinced add greatly to the interest of the narrative if you have no objection to this perhaps you would kindly correct any statements put into your mouth which are not quite accurate or expunge anything which might prejudice you with the public either of the north or the south if unluckily anything of this nature should have crept in my letters were written a day or two after the conversation but you had so much of interest and new to tell me that i do not feel sure that i may not have confused names of battles etc in some instances it will be necessary for me to deliver my part of the performance early in september to the publishers and therefore i should feel much obliged by your sending me an answer at your earliest convenience there will be a mail due here about the first of that month leaving the united states on wednesday the 22d and i shall therefore wait till its arrival before sending my letter to mr kennaway but should i not hear from you then i shall consider you have no objections to make or alterations to suggest and act accordingly if you have any new facts which you think it desirable should be known by the public it will give me much pleasure to be the medium of their communication i am sure i need scarcely tell you with what keen interest i have read all the accounts from your continent of the proceedings in congress and elsewhere in connection with the reconstruction of the south i do sincerely trust it may be eventually effected in a way satisfactory to the south and i most deeply deplore the steps taken by the radical side of the house to set the two north and south by the ears again president johnsons policy seems to me to be that which if pursued would be most likely to contribute to the consolidation of the country but i am both surprised and pained to find how little power the executive has against so strong a faction as the radicals who while they claim to represent the north do in fact but misrepresent the country i am sure you will believe that i say with sincerity that i always take great interest in anything i hears said or that i read of yourself and i am happy to say that even with all the rancour of the northern radicals against the south it is little they find of ill to say of you hoping you will not think i am doing wrong in the course i propose to take and that your answer may be satisfactory i remain my dear general lee yours very sincerely herbert c saunders general robert e lee lexington virginia august 22 1866 mr herbert c saunders 3 bolton gardens south kensington london england my dear mr saunders i received today your letter of the 31st ult what i stated to you in conversation during the visit which you did me the honour to pay me in november last was entirely for your own information and was in no way intended for publication my only object was to gratify the interest which you apparently evinced on the several topics which were introduced and to point to facts which you might investigate if you so desired in your own way i have an objection to the publication of my private conversations which are never intended but for those to whom they are addressed i cannot therefore without an entire disregard of the rule which i have followed in other cases and in violation of my own sense of propriety assent to what you propose i hope therefore you will excuse me what you may think proper to publish i hope will be the result of your own observations and convictions and not on my authority in the hasty perusal which i have been obliged to give the manuscript inclosed to me i perceive many inaccuracies resulting as much from my imperfect narrative as from misapprehension on your part though fully appreciating your kind wish to correct certain erroneous statements as regards myself i prefer remaining silent to doing anything that might excite angry discussion at this time when strong efforts are being made by conservative men north and south to sustain president johnson in his policy which i think offers the only means of healing the lamentable divisions of the country and which the result of the late convention at philadelphia gives great promise of doing thanking you for the opportunity afforded me of expressing my opinion before executing your purpose i am etc r e lee the following is mr saunders account of the interview on only one subject would he take at any length about his own conduct and that was with reference to the treatment of the federal prisoners who had fallen into his hands he seemed to feel deeply the backhanded stigma cast upon him by his having been included by name in the first indictment framed against wirz though he was afterward omitted from the new charges he explained to me the circumstances under which he had arranged with mcclellan for the exchange of prisoners how he had after the battles of manassas fredericksburg and i think chancellorsville sent all the wounded over to the enemy on the engagement of their generals to parole them he also told me that on several occasions his commissary generals had come to him after a battle and represented that he had not rations enough both for prisoners and the army when the former had to be sent several days march to their place of confinement and he had always given orders that the wants of the prisoners should be first attended to as from their position they could not save themselves from starvation by foraging or otherwise as the army could when in straits for provisions the general also explained how every effort had always been made by the confederates to do away with the necessity of retaining prisoners by offering every facility for exchange till at last when all exchange was refused they found themselves with 30000 prisoners for whom they were quite unable to do as much as they wished in the way of food he stated furthermore that many of their hardships arose from the necessity of constantly changing the prisons to prevent recapture with the management of the prisons he assured me he had no more to do than i had and did not even know that wirz was in charge of andersonville prison at least i think he asserted this till after the war was over i could quite sympathise with him in his feeling of pain under which his generous nature evidently suffered that the authorities at washington should have included him and others similarly circumstanced in this charge of cruelty at the time that letters written by himself general lee taken in richmond when captured complaining that the troops in his army had actually been for days together on several occasions without an ounce of meat were in possession of the military authorities when discussing the state of feeling in england with regard to the war he assured me that it had all along given him the greatest pleasure to feel that the southern cause had the sympathies of so many in the old country to which he looked as a second home but in answer to my questions he replied that he had never expected us to give them material aid and added that he thought all governments were right in studying only the interests of their own people and in not going to war for an idea when they had no distinct cause of quarrel on the subject of slavery he assured me that he had always been in favour of the emancipation of the negroes and that in virginia the feeling had been strongly inclining in the same direction till the illjudged enthusiasm accounting to rancour of the abolitionists in the north had turned the southern tide of feeling in the other direction in virginia about thirty years ago an ordinance for the emancipation of the slaves had been rejected by only a small majority and every one fully expected at the next convention it would have been carried but for the above cause he went on to say that there was scarcely a virginian new who was not glad that the subject had been definitely settled though nearly all regretted that they had not been wise enough to do it themselves the first year of the war allusion was made by him to a conversation he had with a distinguished countryman of mine he had been visiting a large slave plantation shirley on the james river the englishman had told him that the working population were better cared for there than in any country he had ever visited but that he must never expect an approval of the institution of slavery by england or aid from her in any cause in which that question was involved taking these facts and the wellknown antipathy of the mass of the english to the institution in consideration he said he had never expected help from england the people at the south as the expression is in the main though scarcely unanimously seem to hold much the same language as general lee with reference to our neutrality and to be much less bitter than northerners generallywho i must confess in my own opinion have much less cause to complain of our interpretation of the laws of neutrality than the south i may mention here by way of parenthesis that i was on two separate occasions one in washington and once in lexington told that there were many people in the country who wished that general washington had never lived and that they were still subjects of queen victoria but i should certainly say as a rule the americans are much too well satisfied with themselves for this feeling to be at all common general lee in the course of this to me most interesting evenings seance gave me many details of the war too long to put on paper but with reference to the small result of their numerous victories accounted for it in this way the force which the confederates brought to bear was so often inferior in numbers to that of the yankees that the more they followed up the victory against one portion of the enemys line the more did they lay themselves open to being surrounded by the remainder of the enemy he likened the operation to a man breasting a wave of the sea who as rapidly as he clears a way before him is enveloped by the very water he has displaced he spoke of the final surrender as inevitable owing to the superiority in numbers of the enemy his own army had during the last few weeks suffered materially from defection in its ranks and discouraged by failures and worn out by hardships had at the time of the surrender only 7892 men under arms and this little army was almost surrounded by one of 100000 they might the general said with an air piteous to behold have cut their way out as they had done before but looking upon the struggle as hopeless i was not surprised to hear him say that he thought it cruel to prolong it in two other battles he named sharpsburg and chancellorsville i think he said the confederates were to the federals in point of numbers as 35000 to 120000 and 45000 to 155000 respectively so that the mere disparity of numbers was not sufficient to convince him of the necessity of surrender but feeling that his own army was persuaded of the ultimate hopelessness of the contest as evidenced by their defection he took the course of surrendering his army in lieu of reserving it for utter annihilation turning to the political bearing of the important question at issue the great southern general gave me at some length his feelings with regard to the abstract right of secession this right he told me was held as a constitutional maxim at the south as to its exercise at the time on the part of the south he was distinctly opposed and it was not until lincoln issued a proclamation for 75000 men to invade the south which was deemed clearly unconstitutional that virginia withdrew from the united states we discussed a variety of other topics and at eleven oclock when i rose to go he begged me to stay on as he found the nights full long his son general custis lee who had distinguished himself much during the war but whom i had not the good fortune of meeting is the only one of his family at present with him at lexington where he occupies the position of a professor in the military institute of virginia this college had 250 cadets in it when the war broke out general stonewall jackson being one of the professors at one moment in the war when the federal were advancing steadily up the shenandoah valley these youths from 16 to 22 years of age were marched to join the confederate army and did good service in one battle at newmarket of which i shall have occasion to speak later in my letters they distinguished themselves in a conspicuous way under the leadership of colonel shipp who is still their commandant by a brilliant charge they contributed in a great measure to turn the tide of affairs losing nine of their number killed and more than forty wounded general hunter on a subsequent occasion when occupying lexington with a body of federal troops quartered his men in the military institute for several days and on leaving had the buildinga very handsome and extensive onefired in numerous places completely destroying all but the external walls which now stand the professors houses stood in detached positions and these too with the house of mr letcher a former governor of the state he also burnt to the ground the washington college the presidency of which general lee now holds they also ransacked destroying everything it contained and were preparing it for the flames to which they were with difficulty restrained from devoting it by earnest representations of its strictly educational nature the general writes to his sonsto his wife at rockbridge bathshe joins her there about once a weekdistinguished and undistinguished callers at his lexington homehe advocates early hourshis fondness for animals i had before this time gone to my farm in king william county and started out in life as a farmer as there was nothing but the land and a few old buildings left for several years i had a very uphill time my father encouraged advised me and gave me material aid his letters to me at this time will show the interest he took in my welfare in one written march 16 1866 after advising me as to steps to be taken in repairing an old mill on the place he writes i am clear for your doing everything to improve your property and make it remunerative as far as you can you know my objections to incurring debt i cannot overcome it i hope you will overcome your chills and by next winter you must patch up your house and get a sweet wife you will be more comfortable and not so lonesome let her bring a cow and a churn that will be all you will want give my love to fitzhugh i wish he were regularly established he cannot afford to be idle he will be miserable my brother fitzhugh here referred to was negotiating to rent his farm the white house to some socalled english capitalists and had not as yet established himself in another letter to me of may 26 1866 my father says i will state at the outset that i desire you to consider romancoke with its appurtenances your own to do with as you consider most to your interest to sell farm or let subject however to the conditions imposed by your grandfathers will as construed by the decree of the court of appeals of virginia which declares if the legacies are not paid off by the personal property hires of slaves rents and sale of the real estate charged with their payment at the end of five years the portion unpaid remains a charge upon the white house and romancoke until paid the devisees take their estates cum onere the result of the war having deprived the estates of the benefit of the hire of the slaves and the sale of smiths island and the personal property having all been swept off by the federal armies there is nothing left but the land of the two estates named a court might make some deduction from the amount of the legacies to be paid in consideration of these circumstances and i should think it would be fair to do so but of that i cannot say now with this understanding make your own arrangements to suit yourself and as you may determine most conducive to your interests in confirming your action as the executor or your grandfather i must however take such measures as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of his will if you are determined to hold the estate i think you ought to make it profitable as to the means of doing so you must decide for yourself i am unable to do it for you and might lead you astray therefore while always willing to give you any advice in my power in whatever you do you must feel that the whole responsibility rests with you i wish my dear son i could be of some advantage to you but i can only give you my love and earnest prayers and commit you to the keeping of that god who never forgets those who serve him may he watch over and preserve you your affectionate father r e lee in another letter of june 13th after telling me of the visit of a cousin of my mothers and how much gratification it was to have her with them he regrets that he son who brought his mother up to lexington had to hurry home on account of having left his wife and little son when you have such pleasing spurs in your flanks i hope you may be on the fair road to prosperity all unite in love to you and fitzhugh ask the latter if george has yet found a horse to trade with the gray we miss him very much my brother had recently visited lexington and want to see you as badly you may judge how poorly we are off the examination has commenced at washington college three days are over successfully and i hope to finish in twelve more has been up in two subjects and not got thrown he has two more but in the meantime i am much occupied and will be confined all day i have no time for letters of affection so must tell you goodbye most affectionately r e lee this was the first final examination at washington college since my father became its president he worked very hard and was kept busy attending to all the details and the putting into practice of several new methods and systems he had introduced that summer he took my mother to the rockbridge baths about eleven miles from lexington to give her the benefit of the waters which he hoped might give her some relief from the continual pain she suffered she did derive benefit but unfortunately had a fall which seriously impeded the improvement in reply to a note from my mother telling him of her misfortune and asking him to send her some medicines he writes the following note lexington virginia august 10 1866 my dear mary on receiving your note yesterday i had only time to get the arnica and send it by the stage i am very sorry that you received such a fall and fear it must have been a heavy shock to you i am however very thankful that you escaped greater injury and hope it is no worse than you describe i will endeavour to get down to see you tomorrow evening and trust i may find you somewhat relieved from its effects we are pretty well here many people are out of town and i have not seen those who are in love to the girls truly and affectionately yours r e lee mrs m c lee my father was still very busy with his college work and after establishing her there spent most of the time in lexington riding traveller over to see her whenever he could get a spare day among the few letters preserved of those written to her at this time i have a note of july 16th my dear mary i am glad to see by your letter of yesterday that you are recovering so well from your fall i hope you may soon be well again caroline the cook got back this morning left her daughter better says there is a very good girl in lynchburg from general cockes estate anxious to live with us i shall have more conversation with her caroline and if satisfied will write for her by the boat tonight her father is in lynchburg and anxious for her to come tell mrs cabell i am sorry to have missed seeing her where is katie i wish she would send her to see me i will endeavour to find some one to carry this to you love to all very affectionately and truly yours r e lee the mails in those days were not very direct and private messenger was often the surest and speediest method of lettercarriage in the absence of my mother my father was trying to better the staff of servants their inefficiency was the drawback to our comfort then as it is now often the recommendation of some was only the name of the estate from which they came a few days later my father writes again lexington virginia july 20 1866 my dear mary i was glad to receive your note this morning and wish it could have reported a marked improvement in your health but that i trust will come in time it has been impossible for me to return to you this week and indeed i do not see how i can absent myself at all i shall endeavour to go to the baths monday and hope during the week you may be able to determine whether it would be more advantageous for you to remain there or go further as i shall have to return here as soon as i can i can accomplish nothing while absent custis ahs determined to accompany mr harris to the white sulphur monday and the girls seem indifferent about leaving home they ask properly what is to become of it mr pierre chouteau son of julia gratiot and charles chouteau will hand you this he will remain over sunday at the baths and can tell you all about st louis i send such letters as have come for you i have no news the heat seems to extend everywhere but it will be cool enough after a time we are as usual except that aunt caroline the cook seems more overcome and harriet the maid indulges in lighter attire i fear mrs myers had an awful time the elliotts do not seem in haste to leave town they are waiting for a cool day to go to the natural bridge and do not seem to have decided whether to go to the baths or alum springs we had an arrival last night from the latter placegeneral colquit and daughters they return tomorrow the girls will write of domestic matters i received a letter from rob at romancoke he is still taking cholagogue but well nothing of interest has occurred affectionately yours r e lee cholagogue was a feverandargue remedy of which i partook largely at that time after this letter my sisters joined my mother at the baths my father still spending most of his time in lexington but riding over to see them whenever he could he was very busy repairing some of the old buildings of the college and arranging his work for the next session here is another short note to my mother lexington virginia august 2 1866 my dear mary mr campbell has just informed me that cousins george and eleanor goldsborough are with you tell them they must not go till i can get to the baths i think the waters of the latter will do them as much good as anything they can try and the sight of them will do me great benefit i find here much to do but will endeavour to be with you tomorrow evening or saturday morning custis has just come but finding me occupied with builders shook hands got his dinner and left for the institute so i do not know where he is from or where he will go next our neighbours are generally well and inquire for you colonel reid better tell the girls if i find them improving i will bring them something remember me to cousins george and eleanor and all the ladies i have about a bushel of letters to answer and other things to do very affectionately r e lee on one of his visits to my mother he took advantage of the comparative quiet and rest there and wrote me a long letter which i give her in full rockbridge baths july 28 1866 my dear robert i was very glad to see from your letter of the 2d the progress you are making in your farm i hope things may move prosperously with you but you must not expect this result without corresponding attention and labour i should like very much to visit you but it will be impossible i have little time for anything but my business i am here with your mother waiting to see the effects of these waters upon her disease before proceeding to the warm springs she is pleased with the bath which she finds very agreeable and it has reduced the swelling in her feet and ankles from which she has been suffering for a long time and in fact from her account entirely removed it this is a great relief in itself and i hope may be followed by greater i do not think she moves with more facility though i think she walks on her crutches oftener and longer than heretofore and probably with more confidence she has been her too short a time to pronounce positively as to the effects of the water and will have to remain three or four weeks before we determine whether she will go further i am unwilling for her to lose the whole summer here unless it promises some advantage and after the middle of next week unless some marked change takes place shall take her to the warm springs custis has gone to the white sulphur but expects to be in richmond on august 6th to meet fitzhugh with the view of going to the warrenton white sulphur springs in north carolina to witness the erection of a monument over dear annie which the kind people of that country have prepared for the purpose my attendance on your mother which is necessary prevents my being present agnes and mildred are here i think the baths have been beneficial to them already though they have not been here a week i will leave them to describe the place and visitors i applied the dressing of salt to the old meadow at arlington with the view of renovating the grass i believe it is equally good for corn it was refuse saltliverpoolwhich i bought cheaply in alexandria from the sacks having decayed and broken but i cannot recollect exactly how much i applied to the acre i think it was about two or three bushels to the acre you had better consult some work on farming as to the quantity i would advise you to apply manure of some kind to all your land i believe there is nothing better or cheaper for you to begin with than shell lime i would prefer cultivating less land manured in some way than a large amount unassisted we are always delighted to hear from you and i trust with care you may escape the chills the incentives i spoke of were a sweet wife and child god bless you my dear son most affectionately r e lee my mother continued to improve so much that she did not go that summer to the warm springs my father spent most of his time in lexington but rode over to the baths about once a week there was nothing he enjoyed more than a good long ride on traveller it rested him from the cares and worries incident to his duties and gave him renewed energy for his work he was often seen that summer along the eleven miles of mountain road between lexington and the baths he made himself acquainted with the people living near it talked to them about their affairs encouraged and advised them and always had a cheery greeting and a pleasant word for them the little children along his route soon became acquainted with the gray horse and his stately rider college reopened the last of september and by october he had his wife and daughters with him again he write to me on october 18th trying to help me in my agricultural perplexities am glad to hear that you are well and progressing favourably your uncle smith says in a letter just received in which he writes of his difficulties and drawbacks i must tell you that if you desire to succeed in any matter relating to agriculture you must personally superintend and see to everything perhaps your experience coincides with his i hope your wheat will reimburse you for your labour and guano i think you are right in improving your land you will gain by cultivating less and cultivating that well and i would endeavour to manure every cropas to the kind of manure which will be the most profitable you must experiment lime acts finely on your land and is more lasting than guano if you can get shells to burn on your land or if not shell lime from baltimore i think you would thereby more certainly and more cheaply restore your fields i hope your sale of shiptimber may place you in funds to make experiments you will have to attend to your contractors they will generally bear great attention and then circumvent you i hope i shall see you this winter when we can talk over the matter we are pretty well your mother is better by her visit to the baths mildred talks of going to the eastern shore of maryland next month and i fear will be absent from us all winter i must refer you to your sisters for all news they are great letterwriters and their correspondence extends over the globe miss etta seldon is with us all our summer visitors have gone and some who i hoped would have visited us have not come goodbye my dear son god bless you your affectionate father r e lee robert e lee jr my uncle smith lee was farming on the potomac and was constantly sending me messages of condolence through my father our experiences were the same as all others starting to farm under the new order of things my father was very hospitable and it delighted him to have his relatives and friends come and see him so many kindnesses had been shown to himself and family for the last five years that he greatly enjoyed this his first opportunity of greeting in his own home those who had so often offered my mother and sisters the shelter of theirs the country around lexington was most beautiful and the climate in the summer and autumn all that could be desired so at those seasons whenever he was at home there was generally some one visiting him nearly always relatives or old and dear friends he entertained very simply made every one feel at home and was always considerate and careful of the amusement and welfare of his guests people came from all over the world to lexington to see him amongst the visitors from afar were the marquis of lorne and the hon mr cooper who were on a tour through the united states they came to lexington to see general lee when they called at the house there happened to be no servant at hand and my father meeting them at the door received their cards not having on his glasses he could not read the names but ushered the strangers into the parlour and presented them to mrs lee without calling their names my mother thought the tall slender youth was a new student and entered into conversation with him as such struck by his delicate appearance she cautioned him against the harsh winter climate of the mountains and urged him to be careful of his health on this mr cooper explained who his companion was and there was much amusement over the mistake the professors and students of the two institutions of learning were constant visitors especially in the evenings when young men came to see the girls if his daughters had guests my father usually sat with my mother in the diningroom adjoining the drawingroom when the clock struck ten he would rise and close the shutters carefully and slowly and if that hint was not taken he would simply say good night young gentlemen the effect was immediate and lasting and his wishes in that matter finally becoming generally known were always respected captain w who had very soon found out the generals views as to the time of leaving was told on one occasion that general lee had praised him very much do you know why said the captain it is because i have never been caught in the parlour at ten oclock i came very near it least night but got into the porch before the general shut the first blind thats the reason he calls me a fine young man a young friend who was a cadet at the virginia military institute called on my sisters one evening and remarked just for something to say do you know this is the first civilians house i have entered in lexington my father was in the room in the room in his gray confederate coat shorn of the buttons also my two brothers custis and fitzhugh both of whom had been generals in the confederate army so there was quite a laugh over the term civilian i have already mentioned how particular my father was about answering all letters it was a great tax on his time and some of them must have been a trial to his temper the following will explain itself lexington virginia september 5 1866 a j requier 81 cedar st new york my dear sir i am very much obliged to you for your kind letter of the 22d ult so many articles formerly belonging to me are scattered over the country that i fear i have not time to devote to their recovery i know no one in buffalo whom i could ask to reclaim the bible in question if the lady who has it will use it as i hope she will she will herself seek to restore it to the rightful owner i will therefore leave the decision of the question to her and her conscience i have read with great pleasure the poem you sent me and thank you sincerely for your interest in my behalf with great respect your obedient servant r e lee here is another one of many of a similar character lexington virginia september 26 1866 mr e a pollard 104 west baltimore st baltimore md dear sir i return you my thanks for the compliment paid me by your proposition to write a history of my life it is a hazardous undertaking to publish the life of any one while living and there are but few who would desire to read a true history of themselves independently of the few national events with which mine has been connected it presents little to interest the general reader nor do i know where to refer you for the necessary materials all my private as well as public records have been destroyed or lost except what is to be found in published documents and i know of nothing available for the purpose should you therefore determine to undertake the work you must rely upon yourself as my time is so fully occupied that i am unable to promise you any assistance very respectfully r e lee this autumn my sister mildred paid a visit to our cousins mr and mrs george golsborough living at ashby near easton on the eastern shore of maryland she remained away there and elsewhere for several months my fathers letters to her many of which have been preserved are most interesting they show very plainly many beautiful phases of his noble character and disposition lexington virginia december 21 1866 my precious life i was very glad to receive your letter of the 15th inst and to learn that you were well and happy may you be always as much so as is consistent with your welfare here and hereafter is my daily prayer i was much pleased too that while enjoying the kindness of your friends we were not forgotten experience will teach you that notwithstanding all appearances to the contrary you will never receive such a love as is felt for you by your father and mother that lives through absence difficulties and times your own feelings will teach you how it should be returned and appreciated i want to see you very much and miss you at every turn yet am glad of this opportunity for you to be with those who i know will do all in their power to give you pleasure i hope you will also find time to read and improve your mind read history works of truth not novels and romances get correct views of life and learn to see the world in its true light it will enable you to live pleasantly to do good and when summoned away to leave without regret your friends here inquire constantly after you and wish for your return mrs white and mrs mcelwee particularly regret your absence and the former sends especial thanks for your letter of remembrance we get on in our usual way agnes takes good care of us and is very thoughtful and attentive she has not great velocity but is systematic and quiet after today the mornings will begin to lengthen a little and her trials to lessen it is very cold the ground is covered with six inches of snow and the mountains as far as the eye can reach in every direction elevate their white crests as monuments of winter this is the night for the supper for the repairs to the episcopal church your mother and sisters are busy with their contributions it is to take place at the hotel and your brother cousins and father are to attend on monday night 24th the supper for the presbyterian church is to be held at their lectureroom they are to have music and every attraction i hope both may be productive of good but you know the episcopalians are few in numbers and light in purse and must be resigned to small returns i must leave to your sisters a description of these feasts and also an account of the operation of the reading club as far as i can judge it is a great institution for the discussion of apples and chestnuts but is quite innocent of the pleasures of literature it however brings the young people together and promotes sociability and conversation our feline companions are flourishing young baxter is growing in gracefulness and favour and gives catlike evidences of future worth he possesses the fashionable colour of moonlight on the water apparently a dingy hue of the kitchen and is strictly aristocratic in appearance and conduct tom surnamed the nipper from the manner in which he slaughters our enemies the rats and the mice is admired for his gravity and sobriety as well as for his strict attention to the pursuits of his race they both feel your absence sorely traveller and custis are both well and pursue their usual dignified gait and habits and are not led away by the frivolous entertainments of lectures and concerts all send united love and all wish for your return remember me most kindly to cousins eleanor and george john mary ida and all at myrtle grove and to other kind friends when you meet them mrs grady carried yesterday to mr charles kerr in baltimore a small package for you be careful of your health and do not eat more than half the plumpuddings cousin eleanor has prepared for xmas i am glad to hear that you are fattening and i hope you will reach 125 lbs think always of your father who loves you dearly r e lee ps 22drob arrived last night with lucy long he thinks it too bad you are away he has not seen you for two years r e lee baxter and tom the nipper were mildreds pets all of us had a fondness for cats inherited from my mother and her father mr custis my father was very fond of them in his way and in their place and was kind to them and considerate of their feelings my father was very fond of them in his way and in their place and was kind to them and considerate of their feelings my mother told of his hearing one of the housepets possibly baxter or the nipper crying and lamenting under his window one stormy night the general got out of bed opened the window and called pussy to come in the window was so high that the animal could not jump up to it my father then stepped softly across the room took one of my mothers crutches and held it so far out of the window that he became wet from falling rain but he persuaded the cat to climb up along the crutch and into the window before he thought of dry clothing fo himself lucy long was my fathers mare which had been lost or stolen at the end of the war and which i had just brought back to him i will give in the following letter his account of her lexington virginia september 4 1866 dr c s garnett dear sir i am much obliged to you for your letter of the 23d ult and the information it contained the mare about which my son wrote you was bred by mr stephen dandridge of the bower berkeley county virginia and was purchased from him for me by general j e b stuart in the fall of 1862after the return of the army from maryland she is nine or ten years old about fifteen hands high square built sorrel not chestnut colour has a fast walk easy pace and short canter when i parted with her she had a full long mane and tail i rode her in conjunction with my gray horse from the fall of 62 to the spring of 64 when she was sent back for refreshment and it was in recalling her in the spring of 65 from mr hairstons in henry county that she got into major paxtons stables of public horses and went to danville with them i think she might be recognised by any member of the army of northern virginia in essex unless much changed i now recollect no distinctive marks about her except a blaze in her forehead and white hindlegs my son general w h f lee residing at the white house in new kent might recognise her and also my son robert who resides near west point in king william captain hopkins to whom you refer in your letter is dead but major paxton who had general charge of the public stables and to whom i referred you letter has sent me the accompanying affidavits of two of the men employed by him should their evidence not be satisfactory he will procure statements from some of the officers which probably may be more definite i should be obliged to you if the mare in question is the one i am seeking for that you would take steps to recover her as i am desirous of reclaiming her in consideration of the donor general stuart your obedient servant r e lee it was proved to the satisfaction of all parties that the mare in question was lucy long and my father reimbursed the man who had bought her from some one who had no right to her she was brought to my place and i recognised her at once she stayed with me until i was ready to pay my christmas visit to lexington she then was put on the train and sent to staunton where i met her i found there colonel william allan a professor of washington college who had a buggy and no horse and as i had a horse and no buggy we joined forces and i drove him over to lexington lucy long carrying us with great ease to herself and comfort to us my father was glad to get her as he was very fond of her when he heard how she came over he was really shocked as he thought she had never been broken to harness she lived to be thirtythree years old and was then chloroformed because my brother thought she had ceased to enjoy life for the last ten years of her life she was boarded out in the country where she did nothing but rest and until about a year before her death she seemed in good health and spirits letters to mildred leeto robertto fitzhughinterviewed by swinton historian of the army of the potomacimprovement in grounds and buildings of washington collegepunctuality a prominent trait of its presidenta strong supporter of the ymca my sister after the christmas holidays went from ashby to baltimore cousins george and eleanor goldsborough taking her with them to their town house i think my father always wanted his daughters with him when they were away he missed them their love care and attention the next letter i find is to mildred in baltimore lexington virginia january 27 1867 my precious daughter your letter to your mother gave us the satisfactory information of your continued good health for i feared that your long silence had been caused by indisposition of body rather than that due to writing i hope you will not let so long an interval between your letters occur again for you know i am always longing to hear from you when i cannot see you and a few lines if only to say you are well will prevent unpleasant apprehensions i am delighted at your increased bodily dimensions and your diminished drapery one hundred and twentyeight avoirdupois is approximately a proper standard seven more pounds will make you all right but i fear before i see you the unnatural life which i fear you will lead in baltimore will reduce you to skin and bone do not go out to many parties preserve your simple tastes and manners and you will enjoy more pleasure plainness and simplicity of dress early hours and rational amusements i wish you to practise you must thank cousins eleanor and george for all their kindness to you and remember me to all friends if you see your uncle marshall present my kind regards to him and my best wishes for his health and happiness i hope you will see robert i heart that he stayed at mr edward dallams when in baltimore but do not know whether he will return there from lynwood i was sorry to hear that you lost your purse perhaps the finder was more in want than you are and it may be of service to him and you can do without it a little money is sometimes useful you must bear in mind that it will not be becoming in a virginia girl now to be fine or fashionable and that gentility as well as selfrespect requires moderation in dress and gaiety while her people are suffering she should practise selfdenial and show her sympathy in their affliction we are all pretty well your poor mother suffers more pain than usual during this inclement weather your sister is devoted to the snow and ice and agnes is becoming a very good housekeeper she has received a letter from a gentleman whose judgement she respects recommending her to acquire that useful knowledge and assuring her that it will not only promote domestic happiness but will add greatly to connubial bliss this is a great encouragement to her our young friends the law students and cadets all inquire after you and wish for your return you know that is my wish and hope so whenever you are ready to return you will know that i am waiting to receive you i will leave your mother and sisters to give you all domestic news tell annette i have been looking for her in every stage since her letter last fall and that i hope for her arrival daily nipper is well and endeavors by stern gravity to repress the frivolity of baxter all unite in much love and i am as ever your father r e lee miss mildred lee just after the intermediate examinations he writes to mildred again lexington virginia february 16 1867 my precious daughter i have wished to answer your letter of the 2d for some days but have not been able the intermediate examinations which were in progress when it arrived continued ten entire days and since their termination the necessary arrangements for the resumption of studies and the reorganisation of the classes have occupied my time not devoted to other pressing matters the students generally passed very creditable examinations many of your friends were distinguished the ordeal through which the higher classes passed was as severe as any i ever witnessed colonel johnston william preston johnston the son of general albert sidney johnston who fell at shiloh he had recently been elected to the chair of history and literature at washington college has arrived and entered upon his duties he is living at the hotel with his wife and six sweet little children being unable to procure a house and the college being too poor to build one for him we have other professors also houseless robert has returned to his brokenback cottage though he confesses to having enjoyed great pleasure during his visit to baltimore he dwells with delight upon his intercourse with the misses whom he considers angels upon earth without wings his account of them increases my desire to get them to virginia miss once promised me to have fitzhugh tell her i will release her from her engagement if she will take rob he was also much gratified at being able to spend a week with you and i am getting very anxious for your return the winter has passed the snow and ice have disappeared and the birds have returned to their favourite resorts in the yard we have however a sea of mud around us through which we have to plunge but i hope the pleasant air and sun now visiting us will soon dissipate it i am glad you are enjoying yourself among such kind friends but do not remain too long as you may detain cousins eleanor and george from the eastern shore markie has sent me a likeness of you on porcelain from the negative taken by the celebrated plecker which she carried with her to philadelphia it is very good but i prefer the original everybody seems anxious for your return and is surprised you can stay so long from your papa may god bless and keep you my dear child is the constant prayer of your devoted father r e lee before mildred returned to lexington she received one more letter from my father in which he advises her of the two routes to lexington and tells her some college news lexington virginia february 23 1867 my precious daughter agnes wishes you to purchase some articles for her and your mother and sister may have some commissions which i fear will reduce your purse to an inconvenient collapse i therefore send a check for dollars which i hope will enable you to gratify their wishes and serve as a reserve for your own wants i hope you are well and passing your time profitably as well as pleasantly the cadets are under the impression that you are at the patapsco institute and will expect to find you on your return more agreeable than ever they are labouring so industriously in mental culture that they believe every one is similarly engaged i went last evening to the celebration of the anniversary of the washington society and was much pleased with the speeches it was held in the methodist church which was filled to overflowing the institute and ann smith female academy were represented your sisters were present and as they were both absent from breakfast this morning i fear so much learning made them sleepy they were also at a cadet hop on the 21st and did not get home till between two and three a m on the 22d i suppose therefore they had splendid times and very fresh society we were somewhat surprised the other morning at mrs gradys committing matrimony i missed at our chapel exercises captain grady and our acting chaplain but did not know at the time what prevented their attendance i heard afterwards that they had put the happy pair in the stage and sent them on their way rejoicing she is now mrs richard norris and has gone to baltimore it will be but fair now that captain grady should go to baltimore and bring us a young lady from there in return for his mother if you see miss armistead ask her to be ready on short notice as we are a people of few words in this region and proceed in all matters in a businesslike way agnes i suppose has told you of all matters of gaiety and fashion she has no doubt too kept you advised of the progress of young baxter and of the deeds of thomas the nipper they are both flourishing and are much admired the roads are so muddy that my evening rides have been suspended and i see nobody you must write me when to expect you the stage from staunton now crosses during the night and when the roads are favourable arrives about two a m when the roads are unfavourable it gets in generally in time for an early breakfast the canalboats have resumed their trips now so you will have a choice of routes from richmond if you conclude to go there all unite with me in much love and i am always your father r e lee from lexington i had gone to baltimore for a short visit and had spent a week with mildred at the home of our cousin mr george washington peter near ellicott city soon after getting back to my farm i received the following letter from my father still trying to help me along in my work lexington virginia february 8 1867 my dear son i was very glad to learn from your letter of the 31st ult that you had enjoyed your visit to baltimore for i feared when you left us that you might have a visit from your shaking enemy i trust however that he has now left you never to return still be prudent and watch his approach closely i hope you may be able to procure some good mules in richmond as it is a matter of importance to your operations if you can get the lime delivered at ten cents i do not know a more economical application to your land i believe you will be repaid by the first crop provided it acts as i think it will of this you must judge and i can only say that if you can accomplish it and wish to try i can send you 300 and will send it by draft to you or to any one in baltimore that you will designate as soon as i hear from you i commend you for not wishing to go in debt or to proceed faster in your operations than prudence dictates i think it economy to improve your land and to begin upon the system you prefer as soon as possible it is your only chance of success so let me know i have to write in haste as the examination is in progress and i have to be present george and robert both came up today in the subjects in which they are respectively weakest so give them your good wishes i received yesterday a letter from mildred regretting your departure from baltimore and expressing the pleasure she derived from having been with you even a short week i hope she will continue well and return to us soon we are all about as you left us the weather has moderated and the ice disappeared from the river though the boats have not yet resumed their trips mud predominates now instead of snow wishing you all happiness i am your affectionate father r e lee robert e lee jr the robert and george mentioned here were two of his nephews whom he was educating at the college the sons respectively of his brothers sydney smith lee and charles carter lee they were members of his household and were treated as his own family to my brother fitzhugh he writes at this time the following chiding him for his extravagance in a christmas gift and asking for some data of the movements of his command it is full of good advice encouragement and affection lexington virginia february 26 1867 my dear fitzhugh you must not think because i write so seldom that you are absent from my thoughts i think of you constantly and am every revolving in my mind all that concerns you i have an ardent desire to see you reestablished at your home and enjoying the pleasure of prosperity around you i know this cannot be accomplished at once but must come from continuous labour economy and industry and be the result of years of good management we have now nothing to do but to attend to our material interest which collectively will advance the interests of the state and to await events the dominant party cannot reign forever and truth and justice will at last prevail i hope i shall be able to get down to see you and rob during the next vacation i shall then have a more correct apprehension of existing circumstances and can follow your progress more satisfactorily i was very much obliged to you for the nice eyeglasses you sent me xmas and asked your mother and the girls to thank you for them which i hope they did i fear they are too nice for my present circumstances and do not think you ought to spend anything except on your farm until you get that in a prosperous condition we have all now to confine ourselves strictly to our necessities while you are your own manager you can carry on cultivation on a large scale with comparatively less expense than on a small scale and your profits will of course be greater i would commence a system of progressive improvement which would improve your land and add steadily to your income i have received lately from fitz lee a narrative of the operations of his division of cavalry i requested custis to write to you for a report of your operations during the winter of 18634 down to april 18 1865 how are you progressing with it i know the difficulties of making such a narrative at this time still by correspondence with your officers and by exerting your own memory much can be done and it will help me greatly in my undertaking make it as full as you can embracing all circumstances bearing on the campaigns affecting your operations and illustrating the conduct of your division i hope you will be able to get up to see us this spring or summer select the time when you can best absent yourself that you may feel the freer and enjoy yourself the more i wish i were nearer to you all your mother is about the same busy with her needle and her pen and as cheerful as ever affectionately your father r e lee general wm h f lee his desire for accounts from his officers of the movements of their commands shows he still intended to attempt to write his campaigns with the army of northern virginia some months later he writes again to my brother and in it he alludes to the dark cloud of the reconstruction days hanging then over the south lexington virginia june 8 1867 my dear son your letter written on your birthday has been welcomed by the whole family and i assure you that we reciprocate your regrets at the distance which separates us although the future is still dark and the prospects gloomy i am confident that if we all unite in doing our duty and earnestly work to extract what good we can out of the evil that now hangs over our dear land the time is not distant when the angry cloud will be lifted from our horizon and the sun in his pristine brightness again shine forth i therefore can anticipate for you many years of happiness and prosperity and in my daily prayers to the god of mercy and truth i invoke his choicest blessings upon you may he gather you under the shadow of his almighty wing direct you in all your ways and give you peace and everlasting life it would be most pleasant to my feelings could i again as you propose gather you all around me but i fear that will not be in this world let us all so live that we may be united in that world where there is no more separation and where sorrow and pain never come i think after next year i will have done all the good i can for the college and i should then like if peace is restored to the country to retire to some quiet spot east of the mountains where i might prepare a home for your mother and sisters after my death and where i could earn my daily bread we will talk of it when we meet this summer i wish to carry your mother to some of the mineral springs where she might obtain some relief but it is hard to know where that can be found she seems now to prefer white sulphur merely on the ground i believe that she has never tried those waters and therefore they might be of service to her if she makes up her mind to go i will endeavour to get her there with one of the girls at least mildred has returned to us looking very well and says she has had a very pleasant tour among her friends and has received a great deal of kindness wherever she has been she seems to be very contented now at home i think you did right to defer her visit to us until you had more leisure i am glad your prospects for a harvest are so good every one must look to his material interests now as labour is our only resource the completion of the railroad to the pamunkey will be a great advantage to you in getting to market what you make and i hope you will put everything to account i hope robert is doing well mary is in staunton where she went a week since to attend miss striblings wedding miss mary stewart is staying with us and i believe is to remain until july when her sister belle is to join her the examination of the students has been progressing a week and will continue until the 20th the young men have so far done very well on the whole mr swinton has paid his visit he seemed to be gentlemanly but i derive no pleasure from my interviews with bookmakers i have either to appear uncivil or run the risk of being dragged before the public i am always as ever your father r e lee general wm h fitzhugh lee the pamunkey was the name of the river on which the white house my brothers estate was situated the railroad from richmond torn up during the war had just been rebuilt to that point swinton was the historian of the federal amy of the potomac he spent some days in lexington and i suppose sought from my father information on points connected with his history of the movements of general grants army my father as i have said before commenced almost as soon as he became the president of the college to improve the grounds roads walks fences etc and systematically kept up this work up to the time of his death the walks about the college grounds were in very bad condition and in wet weather often ankledeep in mud as a first step toward improving them the president had a quantity of limestone broken up and spread upon the roads and walks the rough jagged surface was most uninviting and horsemen and footmen naturally took to the grass seeing colonel t l preston riding one day across the campus on his way to his classes at the virginia military institute my father remarked ah colonel i have depended upon you and your big sorrel to help smooth down my walks another day a student who was walking on the grass saw the general not far away and immediately stepped into the middle of the rocks upon which he manfully trudged along a strange lady going in the same direction followed in the students footsteps and when the youth came within speaking distance my father with a twinkle in his eye thanked him for setting so good an example and added the ladies do not generally take kindly to my walks the buildings also were altered and renovated so far as funds for the purpose permitted he urged the erection as soon as possible of a chapel which should be of dimensions suitable for the demands of the college there were other objects calling for a far greater outlay of money than the resources of the college afforded but he deemed this of great importance and succeeded in getting appropriations for it first he hastened the selection of the site and the drawing of the plans the completion of the work was much retarded owing to the want of funds but his interest in its erection never flagged he gave it his personal superintendence from first to last visiting it often two or three times a day after it was dedicated he always attended morning prayers and all other religious exercises held there unless prevented by sickness whenever i was there on a visit i always went with him every morning to chapel he had a certain seat which he occupied and you could have kept your watch regulated by the time he entered the doors as he thought well of the young men who left his drawingroom by ten oclock so he placed in a higher estimate those who attended chapel regularly especially if they got there in proper time there was no regular chaplain but the ministers of the different denominations who had churches in the village undertook by turns to perform a months service the hour was fortyfive minutes past seven oclock every morning except sunday during the session save in the three winter months december january and february when it was one hour later he was the earnest friend and strong support of the young mens christian association and an annual contributor to its funds upon one occasion at least he placed in its library a collection of suitable books which he had purchased with that intention in his annual reports to the trustees he always made mention of the association giving an account of its operations and progress an incident about travellerthe generals love for childrenhis friendship with expresident davisa ride with his daughter to the peaks of ottermildred lees narrativemrs lee at the white sulphur springsthe great attention paid her husband therehis idea of life since the arrival of lucy long my father was generally accompanied by one of my sisters in his rides whenever the weather and the condition of the roads admitted of their going it took very severe weather to keep him in though often he could not spare the time for during the winter months the days were very short every monday afternoon there was a faculty meeting and the vestry meetings of his church were held two or three times a month whenever i was in lexington i rode with him and when he was prevented by any of the abovementioned causes he would ask me to take traveller out and give him a gallop which i was delighted to do and i think i had my revenge for his treatment of me on that ride from orange to fredericksburg in the winter of 1862 my fathers affection for his horses was very deep and strong in a letter written from the springs one summer to his clerk in lexington he says how is traveller tell him i miss him dreadfully and have repented of our separation but onceand that is the whole time since we parted i think traveller appreciated his love and sympathy and returned it as much as was in a horses nature to do as illustrative of this bond between them a very pretty story was told me by mrs s p lee daughter of general w n pendleton chief of artillery of the a n va and widow of colonel edwin grey lee c s a one afternoon in july of this year the general rode down to the canalboat landing to put on board a young lady who had been visiting his daughters and was returning home he dismounted tied traveller to a post and was standing on the boat making his adieux when some one called out that traveller was loose sure enough the gallant gray was making his way up the road increasing his speed as a number of boys and men tried to stop him my father immediately stepped ashore called to the crowd to stand still and advancing a few steps gave a peculiar low whistle at the first sound traveller stopped and pricked up his ears the general whistled a second time and the horse with a glad whinny turned and trotted quietly back to his master who patted and coaxed him before tying him up again to a bystander expressing surprise at the creatures docility the general observed that he did not see how any man could ride a horse for any length of time without a perfect understanding being established between them my sister mildred who rode with him constantly this summer tells me of his enjoyment of their long rides out into the beautiful restful country nothing seemed to delight him so much i have often known him to give rein to traveller and to at full speed to the top of some long hill then turn and wait for me jogging along on lucy calling out with merry voice come along miss lucy miss lucy lucy long he would question the country people about the roads where they came from where they led to and soon knew every farmers name and every homestead in the country he often said i wish i had a little farm of my own where we could live in peace to the end of our days you girls could attend to the dairy and the cows and the sheep and wait on your mother and me for it is time now for us old people to rest and for the young people to work all the children in the country around were devoted to him and felt no hesitation in approaching him after they once knew him he used to meet his favourites among the little ones on the street and would sometimes lift them up in front of him to give them a ride on traveller that was the greatest treat he could provide there is a very pretty story told of virginia lee letcher his goddaughter and her baby sister fannie which is yet remembered among the lexington people jennie had been followed by her persistent sister and all the coaxing and the commanding of the sixyearold failed to make the younger return home fannie had sat down by the roadside to pout when general lee came riding by jeannie at once appealed to him general lee wont you please make this child go home to her mother the general immediately rode over to where fannie sat leaned over from his saddle and drew her up into his lap there she sat in royal contentment and was thus grandly escorted home when mrs letcher inquired of jennie why she had given general lee so much trouble she received the naive reply i couldnt make fan go home and i thought he could do anything daughters of governor john letcherthe war governor of virginia there was a little boy living with his mother who had come from new york his father had been killed in our army the little fellow now colonel grier monroe of new york city was much teased at his playmates calling him yankee when he knew he was not one one day he marched into my fathers office in the college stated his case and asked for redress the next boy that calls you yankee send him to me said the general which when reported struck such terror into the hearts of his small comrades that the offense was never repeated there was another little boy who was accustomed to clamber up by the side of my father at the morning chapel exercises and was so kindly treated that whenever he saw his distinguished friend he straightway assumed a position beside him at the college commencement which was held in the chapel the little fellow glided from his mothers side and quietly stole up to the platform soon he was nestled at the feet of the dignified president and resting his head upon his knees dropped asleep general lee tenderly remained without moving preferring to suffer from the constrained position rather than disturb the innocent slumberer this boy is now the reverend carter jones of he baptist church about this time expresident davis was freed from the confinement of his prison at fortress monroe where he had been for about two years there was a warm personal friendship between these two men dating from the time they were cadets at west point together and as his unjust and unnecessary imprisonment had pained and distressed none more than my father so his release gave him corresponding joy he at once wrote to him the following letter full of feeling and sympathy lexington virginia june 1 1867 honourable jefferson davis my dear mr davis you can conceive better than i can express the misery which your friends have suffered from your long imprisonment and the other afflictions incident thereto to no one has this been more painful than to me and the impossibility of affording relief has added to my distress your release has lifted a load from my heart which i have not words to tell my daily prayer to the great ruler of the world is that he may shield you from all future harm guard you from all evil and give you that peace which the world cannot take away that the rest of your days may be triumphantly happy is the sincere and earnest wish of your most obedient faithful friend and servant r e lee though my father would take no part in the politics of the country and rarely expressed his views on questions of that nature then occupying the minds of all nevertheless when he deemed it necessary and to the proper person he very plainly said what he thought the following letter to general longstreet in answer to one from him written about this time illustrates what i have said in this connection and explains itself lexington virginia october 29 1867 general j longstreet 21 carondelet street new orleans la my dear general when i received your letter of the 8th of june i had just returned from a short trip to bedford county and was preparing for a more extended visit to the white sulphur springs for the benefit of mrs lees health as i could not write such a letter as you desired and as you stated that you would leave new orleans for mexico in a week from the time you wrote to be absent some months i determined to delay my reply till my return although i have been here more than a month i have been so occupied by necessary business and so incommoded by the effects of an attack of illness from which i have not yet recovered that this is the first day that i have been able to write to you i have avoided all discussion of political questions since the cessation of hostilities and have in my own conduct and in my recommendations to others endeavoured to conform to existing circumstances i consider this the part of wisdom as well as of duty but while i think we should act under the law and according to the law imposed upon us i cannot think the course pursued by the dominant political party the best for the interests of the country and therefore cannot say so or give it my approval this is the reason why i could not comply with the request in your letter i am of the opinion that all who can should vote for the most intelligent honest and conscientious men eligible to office irrespective of former party opinions who will endeavour to make the new constitutions and the laws passed under them as beneficial as possible to the true interests prosperity and liberty of all classes and conditions of the people with my best wishes for your health and happiness and my kindest regards to mrs longstreet and your children i am with great regard and very truly and sincerely yours r e lee this summer my father paid a visit to the peaks of otter a famous group of mountains in the blue ridge range situated in bedford county virginia he rode traveller and my sister mildred accompanied him on lucy long after visiting the peaks and ascending the summit which is 4000 feet in height he rode on to liberty now bedford city ten miles distant and spent the night at avenel the home of the burwells who were friends and connections of his from there the riding party went to captain bufurds about twelve miles distant where they spent the night and the next day the captain was a farmer a great admirer and a staunch upholder of his native state viriginia in her fight for constitutional liberty from 61 to 65 he had sent his sons into the army and had given of his substance freely to support the troops as well as the poor and needy the widow and orphan who had been left in want by the death in battle of their natural protectors and by the ravages of war in the early years of the struggle my mother and sisters when refugeeing had boarded as they thought and intended at the time at his home but when they tried to induce him to accept pay for the shelter and food he had given them for a month or more he sternly refused his was a patriotism that hesitated at no sacrifice and was of a kind and character that admitted of no selfconsideration this trait so strongly developed in him attracted the admiration and respect of my father the visit he paid him was to thank him in person for the kindness extended to his wife and daughters and also for a very large and handsome horse which he had sent my father the last year i think of the war my sister mildred tells me what she can recollect of this ride it is a source of endless regret to us that we cannot recall more his championship was at all times delightful to his children and on an occasion of this kind invigorated by the exercise inspired by the bright skies and relieved of all harassing cares he became almost a boy again my sister mildred says we started at daybreak one perfect june day papa on traveller i on lucy long our saddlebags being our only luggage he was in the gayest humour laughing and joking with me as i paced along by his side on quiet miss lucy traveller seemed to sympathise with his master his springy step high head and bright eye clearly showing how happy he was and how much interest he took in this journey he had to be constantly chided for his restlessness and was told that it would be well for him to reserve some of his too abundant energy for the latter part of his trip at midday we dismounted and tying our horses while resting on the soft grass under a wildplum hedge by the roadside ate our lunch we then rode on and soon came to the james river which was crossed by a ferryboat the ferryman was an old soldier who of course recognised papa and refused payment nor could he be induced to take any further on the road as our horses were climbing a steep rocky ascent we met some little children with very dirty faces playing on the roadside he spoke to them in his gentle playful way alluding to their faces and the desirability of using a little water they stared at us with openeyed astonishment and then scampered off up the hill a few minutes later in rounding this hill we passed a little cabin when out they all ran with clean faces fresh aprons and their hair nicely brushed one little girl exclaiming we know you are general lee we have got your picture that night about nine oclock we reached the little mountain inn at the foot of the peaks ate a hearty supper and soon went to bed tired out by our thirtymile ride our bedrooms seemed to be a loft and the beds were of feathers but i at last slept without turning next morning at dawn of day we set out accompanied by the master of the house and rode for a long time up the mountainside lucy following closely behind traveller finally it became impossible to proceed further on horseback so the horses were fastened to some trees and we climbed the rest of the way to the summit on foot when the top was reached we sat for a long time on a great rock gazing down on the glorious prospect beneath papa spoke but a few words and seemed very sad i have heard there is now a mark on the rock showing where we sat the innkeeper who accompanied us all the way told us that we had ridden nearer the top than any other persons up to that time regaining our horses we proceeded on our second days journey which was to end at liberty some ten miles distant we had not ridden far when suddenly a black thundercloud arose and in a few minutes a heavy shower broke over us we galloped back to a log cabin we had just passed papa lifted me off of lucy and dripping with water i rushed in while he led the horse under an adjacent shed the woman of the house looked dark and glum on seeing the pools of water forming from my dress on her freshly scoured floor and when papa came in with his muddy boots her expression was more forbidding and gloomy he asked her permission to wait there until the shower was over and praised her nice white floor regretting that we had marred its beauty at this praise so becomingly bestowed she was slightly appeased and asked us into the best room which was adorned with colored prints of lee jackson davis and johnston when the shower ceased and papa went out for the horses i told her who i was poor woman she seemed stunned and kept on saying what will joe say what will joe say joe was her husband and had been like every other man in the country a soldier in the army of northern virginia the shower over and the sun shining brightly we rode along joyously through the refreshed hills and dustlaid roads arriving at liberty in good time and went to avenel the pretty home of the burwells the comforts of this sweet old place seemed very delicious to me after my short experience of roughing it papa was much amused when i appeared in crinoline my hoops having been squeezed into the saddlebags and brought with me we remained here the next day sunday and the day after rode on some twelve miles to captain bufords the captain in his shirtsleeves received us with open arms seemed much surprised at my full growth and said why general you called her your little girl and she is a real chuck of a gal he showed us his fine jersey cattle his rich fields and wellfilled barns and delighted in talking of the time during the war when mama mary and agnes paid him a visit he overflowed with kindness and hospitality and his table fairly groaned with the good things papa afterwards constantly quoted his original sayings especially one on early rising which was made on the eve of our arrival when he told us goodnight papa asked him what time he must be ready for breakfast next morning well general said the captain as you have been riding hard and as you are company we will not have breakfast tomorrow until sunup which meant in those june days somewhere before five oclock after a day spent pleasantly here we started next morning early on our return halting for a short time in buchanan we stopped at colonel edmund pendletons who then lived there in an imposing white pillared edifice formerly a bank mrs pendelton gave us some delicious apricots from her garden which my father enjoyed greatly we then proceeded on the road to lexington going by the natural bridge where we had another short rest and reached home the same night about ten oclock after a fortymile ride shortly after this visit captain bufurd sent me a fine jersey cow on condition that i would get up early every morning and milk her and also send him a part of the butter i made after my father returned from this trip he began his arrangements for taking my mother to the greenbriar white sulphur springs he hoped that the waters and the change might be of service to her general health even if they should not alleviated the severity of her rheumatic pains about the first of july my mother sister agnes and miss mary pendleton with my brother custis in charge set out for the white sulphur springs my father with professor j j white decided to make the journey to the same place on horseback they started a day in advance and were at covington when the ladies travelling by stagecoach to goshen thence by rail arrived there after spending the night at covington the passengers were put into as many stagecoaches as were necessary and the long rough drive over the mountains by callahans commenced general lee on traveller was at once recognised and when it was found out by his fellowtravellers that mrs lee was with him attentions and services of all kinds were pressed on her party and a most enjoyable lunch was sent to the stage reserved for her seeing that the other stages were much crowded while the one reserved for his wife had vacant seats my father insisted that some of the others should join his party which they very gladly did he and professor white went ahead of the stages on their horses at the white sulphur springs the harrison cottage in baltimore row had been put at my fathers disposal and the entire party was soon most pleasantly established there mr w w corcoran of washington professor white miss mary pendleton agnes and my father and brother had a table together almost every day some special dainty was sent to this table my mother of course had her meals served in her cottage her faithful and capable servant milly howard was always most eager for her to appear her best and took great pride in dressing her up so far as she was allowed in becoming caps etc to receive her numerous visitors my fathers usual custom while there was to spend some time in the morning in the large parlour of the hotel before taking his ride on traveller after dinner he went again to the parlour and also after tea among the company were many old friends and acquaintances from baltimore who could not sufficiently testify their pleasure in this renewal of intercourse whenever he appeared in the parlour or ballroom he was the centre of attraction and in vain the young men tried to engage the attention of the young ladies when general lee was present during his visit a circus came to dry creek a neighbouring settlement and gave an exhibition the manager rode over to the springs came to my fathers cottage and insisted on leaving several tickets begging that general lee would permit him to send carriages for him and any friends he might like to take to his show these offers my father courteously declined but bought many tickets which he presented to his little friends at the springs during the morning he rode over to dry creek where the crowds of country people many of them his old soldiers feasted their eyes on him to the neglect of the circus that night a special exhibition was given by the manager to general lees friends who were taken to seats draped with confederate colors red and white after the return from the circus my father invited a large party to his cottage to partake of a huge watermelon sent him by express from mobile it weighed about sixty pounds and its producer thought the only fitting way he could dispose of it was to present it to general lee every possible attention that love admiration and respect could prompt was paid my father by the guests at the springs each one seeming anxious to do him homage my mother and sisters shared it all with him for any attention and kindness shown them went straight to his heart after spending three weeks at the white my fathers party went to the old sweet springs where they were all made very comfortable one of the parlours being turned into a bedroom for my mother so that in her wheeled chair she could go out on the verandas and into the ballroom he was taken quite sick there and though he rode over from the white sulphur springs was unable to continue his early rides for some time his room was on the first floor with a window opening on the end of the building one morning when he was very unwell and it was important that he should not be disturbed miss pendleton found a countryman cautiously opening the shutters from the outside she quickly interfered saying go away that is general lees room the man dropped back saying mournfully i only wanted to see him on another occasion some country people came to the springs with plums and berries for sale catching sight of him on the piazza they put down their baskets took off their hats and hurrahed most lustily for marse bob they were his old soldiers when he acknowledged their loyalty by shaking hands with them they insisted on presenting him with their fruit about the first week in september my father rode back to lexington on traveller custis taking my mother and agnes back over the same tedious journey by stage and rail there have been preserved very few letters from him at this time i found one to me full of kindness wholesome advice and offers of aid in which he sends his thanks to the president of the york river railroad for a courtesy tendered him white sulphur springs greenbriar county west virginia august 5 1867 my dear son i received today your letter of the 28th ult inclosing a free ticket over the richmond york river railroad from its president mr dudley please present him my grateful thanks for this mark of his esteem i am very glad to hear that the road is completed to the white house and that a boat connects it with norfolk the convenience of the community and the interests of the road will be promoted thereby it is a difficult undertaking in these times to build a road and i hope the company will soon be able to finish it to west point i suppose you have received before this the letter from your mother and agnes announcing our arrival at this place and informing you of the company the latter has been much increased and among the arrivals are the daingerfields haxalls capertons miss belle harrison etc etc i told agnes to tell you how much we wished you were with us and as an inducement for you to join us if you could leave home if you would come i would pay your expenses i feel very sensibly in my old age the absence of my children though i recognise the necessity of every ones attending to his business and admire him the more for so doing i am very glad that you and fitzhugh have so far escaped the fever and hope you may avoid it altogether be prudent i am very sorry that your harvest promises a poor yield it will be better next year but you must continue systematically the improvement of the land i know of no better method than by liming and if you wish to prosecute it and are in need of help i will aid you to the extent of last year or more so make your arrangements and let me know your wishes a farmers life is one of labour but it is also one of pleasure and the consciousness of steady improvement though it may be slow is very encouraging i think you had better also begin to make arrangements to build yourself a house if you can do nothing more than prepare a site lay out a garden orchard etc and get a small house partly finished so as to inhabit it it will add to your comfort and health i can help you in that too think about it then too you must get a nice wife i do not like you being so lonely i fear you will fall in love with celibacy i have heard some very pleasing reports of fitzhugh i hope that his desires if beneficial to his happiness may be crowned with success i saw the lady when i was in petersburg and was much pleased with her i will get agnes or your mother to tell you what occurs at the springs there are some 500 people here very pleasant and kind but most of my time is passed alone with traveller in the mountains i hope your mother may derive some benefit from the waters but i see none now it will at least afford her some variety and give her some pleasure of which there is a dearth with us now give much love to fitzhugh all unite in love to you god bless you my son prays your affectionate father r e lee early in september my father sent my mother sister home to lexington while he mounted traveller and rode back by way of the hot springs healing and rockbridge alum he was detained by indisposition a day or two at the healing and writes to my mother a little note from that place healing springs september 12 1867 my dear mary i arrived here on the 10th and had expected to resume my journey this morning but did not feel able should nothing prevent i will leave here tomorrow but i fear i shall not be able to reach the rockbridge alum which i am told is twentynine miles distant in that event i will halt on the road and arrive there on saturday lie over sunday and reach lexington on monday i am very anxious to get to lexington and think nothing on the route will benefit me as i feel much concerned about the resumption of the college exercises mr john stewart misses mary and marian mr price and his daughters came over from the hot yesterday to see me the stewarts are there on miss belles account give much love to everybody i hope you reached lexington safely and comfortably and that all are well i hope to see you monday till then farewell very truly and affectionately r e lee it is to be regretted that we have no accounts of these rides the people he met and what he said to them where he stayed and who were his hosts he was very fond of horseback journeys enjoyed the quiet and rest the freedom of mind and body the close sympathy of his old warhorse and the beauties of nature which are to be seen at every turn in the mountains of virginia ah if we could only obtain some records of his thoughts as he rode all alone along the mountain roads how much it would help us all in our trials and troubles he was a man of few words very loath to talk about himself nor do i believe any one ever knew what that great heart suffered his idea of life was to do his duty at whatever cost and to try to help others to theirs lees policy as college presidenthis advice on agricultural mattershis affection for his prospective daughterinlawfitzhughs weddingthe generals ovation at petersburghis personal interest in the students under his care the college exercises were resumed in the last weeks of september my mother and sisters were all back at home the presidents work now more in hand began to show results the number of students this session was largely increased and the outlook of the college was very much brighter he had from the beginning of his presidency a distinct policy and plan which he had fully conceived and to which he steadily adhered so that all his particular measures of progress were but consistent steps in its development his object was nothing less than to establish and perfect an institution which should meet the highest needs of education in every department at once and without waiting for the means to be provided in advance he proceeded to develop this object under his advice new chairs were created and professors called to fill them so that before the end of the first year the faculty was doubled in numbers still additional chairs were created and finally a complete system of schools was established and brought into full operation so admirably was the plan conceived and administered by general lee that heterogeneous as were the students especially in the early years each one found his proper place and all were kept in line of complete and systematic study under this organisation and especially under the inspiration of his central influence the utmost harmony and utmost energy pervaded all the departments of the college the highest powers of both professors and students were called forth under the fullest responsibility the standards of scholarship were rapidly advanced and soon the graduates of washington college were the acknowledged equals of those from the best institutions elsewhere and were eagerly sought after for the highest positions as teachers in the best schools the resultswere due directly and immediately more than to all other causes to the personal ability and influence of general lee as president of the college so wrote professor edward s joynes in an article published soon after general lees death in the university monthly all of this had not been accomplished as yet but the work was well advanced and the results began to be evident his health had not been strong since the middle of the summer but he never ceased in his endeavour to better the condition of the college and to improve the minds morals and bodies of the young men committed to his charge he writes to me about this time encouraging me to renewed efforts telling me how to better my condition and advising me not to be cast down by difficulties lexington viriginia october 26 1867 my dear rob your letter of the 10th did not give me a very favourable account of yourself or your prospects but i have no doubt it was true and therefore commendable we must not however yield to difficulties but strive the harder to overcome them i am sorry for the failure of your crops your loneliness and uncomfortableness and wish it were in my power to visit you and advise with you but you must come up this winter when convenient and we will discuss the whole matter fitzhugh i hope will be married soon and then he will have more time to counsel with you i hope between you two you will devise some mode of relief the only way to improve your crop is to improve your land which requires time patience and good cultivation lime i think is one of the chief instruments and i advise you to apply that systematically and judiciously i think too you had better purchase another pair of mules i can help you in these items and if you need can advance you 500 then as regards a house i can help you in that too but you must first select a site and a plan the first can only be found on the land and the latter might be adopted on the progressive principle commencing with the minor members and finishing with the principal ones as convenience or necessity might authorise if no better can be found how would the present site answer if you are going to cultivate the lower part of the farm it would at least have the advantage of convenience or if you thought it better to divide and sell your farm it would answer for one of the divisions i am clear for your marrying if you select a good wife otherwise you had better remain as you are for a time an imprudent or uncongenial woman is worse than the minks i had written to him that they had destroyed all my hens i think upon the whole you are progressing very well and have accomplished the worst part a failure in crops will occur occasionally to every farmer even the best with favourable surroundings it serves a good purpose inculcates prudence and economy and excites energy and perseverance these qualities will overcome everything you are very young still and if you are virtuous and laborious you will accomplish all the good you propose to yourself let me know if you want the money we are pretty well i am better and your poor mother more comfortable i think than she was last year the girls are as usual and custis is in far better health than he was before his visit to the springs he seems however not happy and i presume other people have their troubles as well as farmers god bless you my son and may he guard guide and direct you in all you do all would unite in love did they know i was writing truly and affectionately your father r e lee robert e lee jr my brother fitzhugh was to be married that autumn this event so soon to take place gave my father great pleasure he was an earnest advocate of matrimony and was constantly urging his sons to take to themselves wives with his daughters he was less pressing though apparently always willing to have another daughter he did not seem to long for any more sons he thus writes to my brother when his engagement was formally announced to him lexington virginia september 20 1867 my dear fitzhugh i have been anxious for some time to write to you to express the pleasure i have felt a the prospects of your marriage with miss bolling but sickness has prevented and i am still so feeble that i cannot attend to the pressing business connected with the college as you know how deeply i feel all that concerns you you may feel assured of the pleasure i derived from your letter to your mother informing her of your engagement i have the most pleasing recollection of miss tabb and of her kindness to me and now that she has consented to by my daughter the measure of my gratitude is filled to overflowing i hope she will not delay the consummation for i want to see her very much and i fear she will not come to see me until then you must present her my warm love and you both must accept my earnest prayers and most fervent wishes for your future happiness and prosperity i am glad that your house is progressing and that your crops promise well i hope that you soon will be able to come and see us your mother i hope has derived some benefit from her visit to the springs her general health is improved but i see no relaxation in her rheumatic complaint the girls are quite well and all send love your affectionate father r e lee general william h f lee the young lady who was so soon to become a member of his family was miss mary tabb bolling the daughter of mr g w bolling of petersburg virginia her father had been very kind to general lee during the eventful months of the siege of that town and his daughter had been often to see him and was a great favourite of his my brother was especially anxious that his father should be present at his wedding and had been urging him to make his arrangements to come the sickness to which he frequently alludes in his recent letters had been annoying him since his return from the white sulphur springs up to this time and he now writes proposing that my brother and bride should come to him instead of his going to the wedding lexington virginia november 15 1867 my dear fitzhugh i received this morning your letter of the 13th and am glad to hear of your safe arrival and of the favourable condition of things at your home i was afraid your house would not be ready at the time supposed but i would not delay the wedding on that accountyou can exist without it we have one here at your service though a poor one i am obliged to you for having arranged about my clothes upon reflection i think it better not to go to the white house and romancoke before the wedding you and robert could hardly pay the necessary attention to business matters with your hands filled with love and matrimony i think of catching up rob and marrying him to some of my sweethearts while i am down so as to prevent the necessity from him to reach petersburg by the 28th and we have arranged to commence our journey on monday night 25th inst at 12 m so as to reach richmond tuesday evening remain there the 27th and go to petersburg the 28th i do not think i shall be able to go to the white house at all i should not be able to aid you or rob my only object and would put you to much trouble we are all as you left us and miss you and mildred very much very affectionately your father r e lee general william h f lee so it was all settled satisfactorily my brother gained his point and my father arranged his affairs so that he could absent himself without detriment to his work at the college he left on the appointed day and hour and the morning after arriving in richmond writes my mother exchange hotel richmond november 26 1867 my dear mary we reached here yesterday about 4 p m after a not uncomfortable journey and found fitzhugh waiting for the important event i doubt whether his house will be finished from his account till january though he thinks it will his plans i believe as far as he can form them are to leave petersburg the morning after the wedding for baltimore where they will probably send a week gathering up their furniture etc and after that all is undetermined i renewed the invitation for their visit to us but he could not decide robert is expected tomorrow mildred is well and seems to be perfectly happy as she had on last evening a dress about two yards longer than norvells i saw mr davis who looks astonishingly well and is quite cheerful he inquired particularly after you all he is at judge oulds no one seems to know what is to be done judge chase had not arrived yesterday but it was thought probable he would reach here in the ten oclock train last night i have not heard this morning i will present myself to the court this morning and learn i hope what they wish of me williams wickham is here and will attend the wedding annie will also go fitzhugh is to go out to hickory hill this morning and return this afternoon to pay his adieux mrs caskie was not well last evening the rest as usual and send much love custis is well and i have my clothes i left my sleevebuttons in my shirt hanging up in my dressingroom ask cornelia to take care of them mr alexander said he would send you up some turkeys and colonel johnston that he would help you revise the manuscript it is time i should get my breakfast as i wish to transact some business before going to court give much love to the girls and everybody i hope you are well and will want for nothing while i am away most truly yours mrs m c lee r e lee general lee was summoned this time as a witness in the trial of mr davis but after some delay a nolle prosequi was filed general lee after the war was asked by a lady his opinion of the position and part mr davis had taken and acted during the war was asked by a lady of his opinion of the position and part mr davis had taken and acted during the war he replied if my opinion is worth anything you can always say that few people could have done better than mr davis i knew of none that could have done as well on the morning after the wedding he writes to my mother petersburg november 29 1867 my dear mary our son was married last night and shone in his happiness the bride looked lovely and was in every way captivating the church was crowded to its utmost capacity and the streets thronged everything went off well and i will enter into details when i see you mr wickham and annie mr fry john wood and others were present mr davis was prevented from attending by the death of mrs howell the misses haxall miss enders miss giles etc came down from richmond fitzhugh lee was one of the groomsmen custis very composed and rob suffering from chills many of my acquaintances were present and everybody was very kind regrets were often expressed that you mary and agnes were not present i believe the plan was for the bride and groom to start on their travels this morning but i doubt whether it will be carried out as i thought i saw indications of a change of purpose before i left which i had no doubt would be strengthened by the reflections of this morning i shall remain today and return to richmond tomorrow i wish to go to brandon monday but do not know that i can accomplish it until leaving richmond my whole time was taken up by the august court so that i could do nothing nor see anybody there mildred was all life in white and curls i am staying at general mahones and have got hold of one of his needlepens with which i can do nothing excuse illegibility no one has descended to breakfast yet i received on arriving here yesterday at 3 p m a kind note from our daughter asking me to come and see her as soon after my arrival as convenient which i did and carried over the necklace which she pronounced very pretty give my love to all most truly yours r e lee mrs m c lee a special car carried general lee and the other wedding guests from richmond to petersburg he did not enter into the gay conversation of the young people but appeared sad and depressed and seemed to dread seeing the town of petersburg and meeting its people this feeling was dispelled by the enthusiastic welcome given him by every one there general mahone whose guest he was to be met him at the depot with a carriage and four white horses many of the citizens tried to take out the horses and pull the carriage into the town but the general protested declaring if they did so he would have to get out and help them the morning after the wedding he drove out to turnbulls to see an old woman who had been very kind to him sending him eggs butter etc when he had had his headquarters near by during the siege on his return he took lunch at mr bollings and held an impromptu reception everybody coming in to speak to him that night he went to an entertainment given to the bride at mr johnsons he enjoyed the evening very much and expressed his feeling of relief at seeing every one so bright and cheerful he was delighted to find the people so prosperous and to observe that they had it in their hearts to be gay and happy the next morning he returned to richmond he was escorted to the train in the same way in which he had been received all the people turned out to see him leave and he departed amid tremendous cheering my father enjoyed this visit it had been a success in every way his old friends and soldiers called on him in great numbers all eager to look on his face and clasp his hand again the night of the wedding the streets were filled with crowds anxious to see him once more and many to look on him for the first time where ever he was seen he was treated with the greatest love admiration and respect it was with devotion deep sincere and true mixed with awe and sadness that they beheld their old commander on foot in citizens dress grayer than three years ago but still the same passing along the ways where he had so often ridden on traveller with the noise of battle all around what a change for him what a difference to them but their trust and faith in him were as unshaken as ever a glimpse of his feelings at this time is shown in one of his letters written a few weeks later which i will give in its proper place the day after his return to richmond he write to my mother richmond december 1 1867 my dear mary i returned here yesterday with custis robert and fitz lee we left fitzhugh and his bride in petersburg mildred is with them in consequence of being told that the new couple were to leave petersburg the morning after the wedding i had made my arrangements to return here saturday if i had known that they would remain till monday as is now their intention i should have made my arrangements to stay mildred will come up with them on monday and go to mrs caskies i proposed to custis rob and fitz to remain in petersburg till that time but they preferred coming with me i shall go to brandon tomorrow morning and will take custis and robert with me i propose to return here tuesday finish my business wednesday spend thursday at hickory hill take passage for lexington friday where i hope to arrive saturday as far as i could judge our new daughter will go to baltimore december 2d and probably return here the following monday fitzhugh will go down to the white house during the week and make arrangements for their sojourn there he can go down in the morning and return in the evening i repeated our invitation to her to visit us on their return from baltimore but she said fitzhugh thought it better fo them to defer it till the spring but she would write to let us know i do not think she will come at this time for she is in that happy state which causes her to take pleasure in doing what she thinks he prefers and he i think would like to go to the white house and arrange for winter i went up to caskies last evening saw norvell but mr and mrs caskie were both sick upstairs the latter is better than when i last wrote and free from pain i paid several visits yesterday evening and took rob with me mrs tripletts mrs peebles mrs branders mrs j r andersons at the latter place i met mrs robert stannard who looked i thought remarkably well she is living with hugh her son on his farm i also went to mrs dunlops and saw there general and miss jennie cooper the latter looked remarkably well but the former is very thin they will remain here some weeks i have not seen colonel allan since my return from petersburg but am told that he is better you must give a great deal of love to all with you i am very anxious to get back and i hope that you are all well it is very cold here this morning and ice is abundant goodbye truly and affectionately r e lee the people mentioned here as those he called on were all friends living in richmond with whom my mother had become well acquainted during her stay there in war times there were many others he went to see for i remember going with him he sat only a few minutes at each placecalled just to shake hands he would say all were delighted to see him from some places where he had been well known he could hardly get away he had a kind word for all and his excuse for hurrying on was that he must try to see so and so as mrs lee had told him to be sure to do so he was bright and cheerful and was pleased with the great affection shown him on all sides on the day he had appointedmonday the 2d of decemberwe started in the morning for brandon we took the steamer down james river passing through much of the country where he had opposed mcclellan in 62 and grant in 64 custis and i were with him he said very little as i remembernothing about the warbut was interested in all the old homesteads along the route many of which he had visited in the days long ago and whose owners had been his relatives and friends he expressed great regret at not being able to stop at shirley which was the birthplace and home of his mother before she married he stayed at brandon one night only taking the same boat as it returned next day to richmond they were all glad to see him and sorry to let him go but his plans had been formed beforehand according to his invariable custom and he carried them out without any change spending one day in richmond he went from there to hickory hill thence to lexington arriving there the saturday he had fixed on i bade him and my brother custis goodbye in richmond and returned to my home to my brother fitzhugh after his return from his wedding trip he writes lexington virginia december 21 1867 my dear fitzhugh i was very glad last night to receive your letter of the 18th announcing your return to richmond i did not like my daughter to be so far away i am glad however that you had so pleasant a visit which has no doubt prepared you for the enjoyments of home and will make the repose of xmas week in petersburg doubly agreeable i had a very pleasant visit to brandon after parting with you which custis and robert seemed equally to enjoy and i regretted that i could only spend one night i passed shirley both going and returning with regret from my inability to stop but custis and i spent a day at hickory hill on our way up very agreeably my visit to petersburg was extremely pleasant besides the pleasure of seeing my daughter and being with you which was very great i was gratified in seeing many friends in addition when our armies were in front of petersburg i suffered so much in body and mind on account of the good townspeople especially on that gloomy night when i was forced to abandon them that i have always reverted to them in sadness and sorrow my old feelings returned to me as i passed wellremembered spots and recalled the ravages of the hostile shells but when i saw the cheerfulness with which the people were working to restore their condition and witnessed the comforts with which they were surrounded a load of sorrow which had been pressing upon me for years was lifted from my heart this is bad weather for completing your house but it will soon pass away and your sweet helpmate will make everything go smoothly when the spring opens and the mockingbirds resume their song you will have much to do so you must prepare in time you must give a great deal of love for me to all at mr bollings to general and mrs mahone and other friends we shall be very glad when you can bring our daughter to see us select the time most convenient to you and do not let it be long distant tell her i wish to see her very much as do also her mama and sisters your mother regrets that you did not receive her letter in answer to yours from baltimore she wrote the day of its reception and addressed it to new york as you directed the box about which you inquired arrived safely and was much enjoyed mary is in baltimore where she will probably spend the winter as i am so far from mildred it will be difficult for her to make up her mind when to return so that the whole care of the household devolves upon agnes who is occupied all the morning teaching our niece mildred god bless you all is the prayer of your devoted father r e lee general wm h f lee the christmas of 1867 i spent as usual in lexington with my father he had been president of the college now a little more than two years the number of professors and students had largely increased the chapel had been build many improvements made to the lecturerooms and halls the grounds improved by the laying out of new roads and walks the inclosures renewed the grass restored to the campus and new shade trees set out over the college grounds the increase in the number of professors demanded more houses for them as a move in this direction the trustees decided to build a new house for the president so that the one he now occupied could be used for one of the faculty accordingly the appropriations of a sum was made and my father was authorised to build according to a plan of his own selection he took a keen interest in this matter and at once commenced designing a new presidents house on the lot which had previously been occupied by an old building devoted to the same purpose this was completed in the summer of 1869 the endowment fund of the college had been increased by liberal contributions from several philanthropic persons and also by a better investment of the resources already belonging to the institution the fees from the greater number of students also added much to its prosperity his interest in the student individually and collectively was untiring by the system of reports made weekly to the president and monthly to the parent or guardian he knew well how each one of his charges was getting on whether or not he was progressing or even holding his own if the report was unsatisfactory the student was sent for and remonstrated with if that had no effect the parents were advised and requested to urge the son to try to do better if the student still persisted in wasting his time and money his parents were asked to call him home as illustrating how well the president was acquainted with the student and how accurate was his remembrance of their individuality it is related that on one occasion a name was read out in faculty meeting which was unfamiliar to him he asked that it be read out again and repeated the name to himself adding in a tone of selfreproach i have no recollection of a student of that name it is very strange that i have forgotten him i thought i knew every one in college how long has he been here an investigation proved that the student had recently entered during his absence and that he had never seen him he won the confidence of the students and very soon their affections he regarded a mass of petty regulations as being only vexatious and yet by his tact and firmness his discipline became most effective very seldom was there any breaking of the laws he was so honoured and loved that they tried to please him in all things of course there were exceptions i give here some letters written to parents and guardians which will show how he tried to induce these triflers to become men lexington virginia march 25 1866 my dear sir i am very glad to learn from your letter of the 13th inst that you have written your son in reference to his neglect of his studies i am sure your letter and the kind admonition of his mother will have a beneficial effect upon him i have myself told him as plainly but as kindly as i could that it was necessary for him to change his course or that he would be obliged to return home he had promised me that he would henceforth be diligent and attentive and endeavour in all things to perform his duty i hope that he may succeed for i think he is able to do well if he really makes the effort will you be so kind as to inform mrs w that i have received her letter of the 19th it will give me great pleasure at all times to aid her son in every way i can but if he desires no benefit from his connection with the college it will be to his interest to return home very truly your obedient servant r e lee here is another letter showing the patience and forbearance of the president and his earnest desire to help on in life the young men committed to his charge washington college lexington virginia april 20 1868 my dear sir i regret to see from your letter of the 29th ult to the clerk of the faculty that you have misunderstood their action in reference to your son he was not dismissed as you suppose from the college but every means having been tried by the faculty to induce him to attend faithfully and regularly to his studies without effect and great forbearance having been practised it was thought best for him and just to you that he should return home the action of the faculty was purposely designed not to prevent his being received into any other college or to return to this should you so desire the monthly reports are intended to advise parents of the progress of their sons and it was supposed you would have seen the little advancement made by yours in his studies and that no further notice was required the action of the faculty was caused by no immorality on his part but by a systematic neglect of his duties which no counsel on the part of his professors or my own could correct in compliance however with your wishes and on the positive promise of amendment on the part of your son he has been received into college and i sincerely hope that he will apply himself diligently to his studies and make an earnest effort to retrieve the time he has lost with great respect your obedient servant r e lee this letter too shows his fatherly interest washington college lexington virginia march 19 1868 my dear sir before this you have learned the affecting death of your son i can say nothing to mitigate your grief or to relieve your sorrow but if the sincere sympathy of his comrades and friends and of the entire community can bring you any consolation i can assure you that you possess it in its fullest extent when one in the pureness and freshness of youth before having been contaminated by sin or afflicted by misery is called to the presence of his merciful creator it must be solely for his good as difficult as this may be for you now to recognise i hope you will keep it constantly in your memory and take it to your comfort and i pray that he who in his wise providence has permitted this crushing sorrow may sanctify it to the happiness of all your son and his friend mr birely often passed their leisure hours in rowing on the river and on last saturday afternoon the 4th inst attempted what they had more than once been cautioned againstto approach the foot of the dam at the public bridge unfortunately their boat was caught by the returncurrent struck by the falling water and was immediately upset their perilous position was at once seen from the shore and aid was hurried to their relief but before it could reach them both had perished efforts to restore your sons life though long continued were unavailing mr birelys body was not found until the next morning their remains were yesterday sunday conveyed to the episcopal church in this city where the sacred ceremony for the dead were performed by the reverend dr pendleton who nineteen years ago at the faroff home of their infancy placed upon them their baptismal vows after the service a long procession of the professors and students of the college the officers and cadets of the virginia military academy and the citizens of lexington accompanied their bodies to the packetboat for lynchburg where they were place in charge of messrs wheeler baker to convey them to frederick city with great regard and sincere sympathy i am most respectfully r e lee the general believes in the enforcement of law and orderhis moral influence in the collegeplayful humour shown in his lettershis opinion of negro labourmr daviss trialletter to mrs fitzhugh leeintercourse with faculty virginia was at this time still under military rule the reconstruction days were not over my father had himself accepted the political situation after the war and had advised every one who had sought his advice to do the same the following incident and letters will show his acquiescence in the law of the land and ready submission to the authorities in a street disturbance that spring a student had been shot by a negro and it was reported that in case of the young mans death the murderer would be summarily dealt with by his collegemates captain wagner the military commissioner wrote to general lee informing him of these reports he received the following reply washington college lexington virginia may 4 1868 captain wagner commissioner district lexington virginia sir upon investigation of the reports which you communicated to me yesterday afternoon i can find no foundation for the apprehension that the students of washington college contemplate any attack upon the man confined in jail for shooting mr friday night on the contrary i have been assured by members of the faculty and individual students that they have heard no suggestion of the kind and they believe that no such intention has been entertained or now exists i think therefore the reports made to you are groundless very respectfully your obedient servant r e lee however in order to take all precautions and provide against any disturbance he wrote as follows to the president of the young mens christian association whom he knew well and trusted and who was a man of much influence with his fellowstudents mr g b strickler president young mens christian association washington college i have just been informed by captain wagner military commissioner of this district that from information received by him he had reason to apprehend that should the wound received by mr friday night prove fatal the students of washington college contemplate taking from the jail the man who shot him and inflicting upon him summary punishment i cannot believe that any such act is intended or would be allowed by the students of washington college thought it is possible that such an intention may have been spoken of amongst them i think it only necessary to call the attention of the students to the report to prevent such an occurrence i feel convinced that none would countenance such outrage against law and order but that all will cheerfully submit to the administration of justice by the legal authorities as the readiest way of communicating with the students at this hour on sunday i have concluded to address you this letter that through the members of the young mens christian association the students generally may be informed of the apprehension entertained by the military authorities and i earnestly invoke the students to abstain from an violation of law and to unite in preserving quiet and order on this and every occasion very respectfully your obedient servant r e lee the young man recovered there was no disturbance of any kind nor was it believed that there would have been after this appeal from the president even if the wound had proved fatal nor was it a moral influence alone that he exerted in the college he was equally careful of the intellectual interests he watched the progress of every class attended all the examinations and strove constantly to stimulate both professors and students to the highest attainments the whole college in a word felt his influence as an everpresent motive and his character was quietly but irresistibly impressed upon it not only in the general working of all its departments but in all the details of each of this influence general lee modest as he was was perfectly aware and like a prudent ruler he husbanded it with wise economy he preferred to confine his direct interposition to purely personal acts and rarelyand then only on critical occasionsdid he step forward to present himself before the whole body of students in the full dignity of his presidential office on these occasions which in the latter years hardly ever occurred he would quietly post an address to the students in which appealing only to the highest principals of conduct he sought to dissuade them from threatened evil the addresses which the boys designated as his general orders were always of immediate efficacy no single case ever occurred in which they failed of instant and complete effect and no student would have been tolerated by his fellowstudents who would have dared to disregard such an appeal from general lee professor joynes in university monthly my father had recovered form the spell of sickness of the previous summer at the old sweet springs which had weakened and depressed him until about the time he attended my brothers wedding that marriage had been a great joy to him his trip there and back and his visits to brandon and hickory hill the change of climate and scene seeing old friends and new places had all contributed to benefit his health and spirits i remember this christmas of 1867 he seemed particularly bright and cheerful i give a letter he wrote me after i had left for my home which reflects his playful humour and good spirits lexington virginia january 23 1868 my dear robert i inclose a letter which has just arrived in the mail it seems to be from a nice young lady judging from the style and address i hope she is the right one and that her response is favourable put in a good crop and recollect you may have two to feed after the harvest we are doing what we can in this region to supply the springs and streams that form the lowland rivers it is still raining though the snow and ice have not left us after your departure mr gordon brought to me a letter from fitzhugh to your mother which had come in the sunday mail and was overlooked among the papers i am sorry it had not been found before you left as you would have known their plans tell them i am sorry not to have seen them we miss you very much life has it all her own way now and expends her energy in regulating her brother and putting your mothers drawers and presses to rights its her only vent and furnishes exercise for body and mind there is to be a great fete in your mothers room today the grace church sewing society is to meet there at 10 a mthat is if the members are impervious to water i charged the two mildreds to be seated with their white aprons on and with scissors and thimbles in hand i hope they may have a refreshing time goodbye your father r e lee robert e lee the second mildred mentioned here was my fathers niece daughter of charles carter lee she was living with my father at this time going to school and was like her cousin the other mildred not very fond of her needle his nickname for her was powhattie derived i presume from her native county of powhatan he was very fond of teasing her in his playful way indeed we all enjoyed that attention from him he never teased any one whom he did not especially like to his new daughter i find the following letter written at this time in which he shows his affection and admiration for her lexington virginia march 10 1868 my beautiful daughter i have been wishing to write to you for a long time but have supposed that you would be so engrossed with my sons with their plans and their projects that you could not lend an ear to your papa but now i must tell you how much i have thought of you how much i want to see you and how greatly i was disappointed at your not getting to see us at the time you proposed you must not postpone your visit too long or you may not find us here our winter which has been long and cold i hope now is over the gardeners are busy the grass is growing green and the atmosphere warm and inspiring i presume under its genial influence you and fitzhugh are busy improving your new home i hope everything is agreeable and that you are becoming more and more interested in making those around you happy that is the true way to secure your own happiness for which my poor prayers are daily offered to the throne of the most high i have been summoned to richmond the third thursday in this month as a witness in the trial against mr davis and though that will be a painful errand for me i hope that it will give me the pleasure of seeing you i will endeavour to get down some day to the white house if it is only to spend sunday with you i hope that you will be able to pay some attention to your poor brother robert do not let his elder brother monopolise you altogether you will have to take care of both till you can find some one like yourself to take romancoke in hand do you think miss anne banister will consent mildred you know is the only one of the girls who has been with us this winter she has consequently had her hands full and considers herself now a great character she rules her brother and my nephews with an iron rod and scatters her advice broadcast among the young men of the college i hope that it may yield an abundant harvest the young mothers of lexington ought to be extremely grateful to her for her suggestions to them as to the proper mode of rearing their children and though she finds many unable to appreciate her system she is nothing daunted by the obtuseness of vision but takes advantage of every opportunity to enlighten them as to its benefits mary and agnes are still in baltimore and are now at the house of mrs charles howard agnes expects i believe to return to the peters near ellicott city and then go over to the eastern shore of maryland to visit the goldsboroughs and other friends i hardly think either of them will get back before june i have recently received a very pretty picture from a young lady of baltimore miss mary jones whom i met last summer at the white sulphur springs in one of my morning rides to the beaverdam falls near the sweet springs i found her at the foot of the falls making a sketch of the scene and on her return home she finished it and has sent it to me it is beautifully painted and is a faithful representation of the falls i think you will be pleased with it when you come up and agree with me in the opinion that it is the principal ornament of our parlour i am sorry to inform you that your poor mama ahs been suffering more than usual lately from her rheumatic pains she took cold in some way which produced a recurrence of her former pangs though she is in a measure now relieved we often wish for you and fitzhugh my only pleasure is in my solitary evening rides which give me abundant opportunity for quiet thought with a great deal of love to your husband i am your sincerely attached father r e lee mrs william h fitzhugh lee the next letter i find is a reply to one of mine in which i evidently had been confiding to him my agricultural woes lexington virginia march 12 1868 my dear rob i am sorry to learn from your letter of the 1st that the winter has been so hard on your wheat i hope however the present good weather is shedding its influence upon it and that it will turn out better than it promises you must however take a lesson from the last season what you do cultivate do well improve and prepare the land in the best manner your labour will be less and your profits more your flat lands were always uncertain in wet winters the uplands were more sure is it not possible that some unbidden guest may have been feasting on your corn six hundred bushels are are a large deficit in casting up your account for the year but you must make it up by economy and good management a farmers motto should be toil and trust i am glad that you have got your lime and sown your oats and clover do you use the drill or sow broadcast i shall try to get down to see you if i go to richmond for i am anxious to know how you are progressing and to see if in any way i can aid you whenever i can you must let me know you must still think about your house and make up your mind as to the site and kind and collect the material i can help you to any kind of plan and with some ready money to pay the mechanics i have presently had a visit from dr oliver of scotland who is examining lands for immigrants from his country he seems to be a sensible and judicious man from his account i do not think the scotch and english would suit your part of the country it would require time from them to become acclimated and they would probably get dissatisfied especially as there is so much mountainous region where they could be accommodated i think you will have to look to the germans perhaps the hollanders as a class would be the most useful when the railroad shall have been completed to west point i think there will be no difficulty in getting the whites among you i would try to get some of our own young men in your employ i rode out the other day to mr andrew camerons and went into the field where he was plowing i took great pleasure in following the plows around the circuit he had four in operation three of them were held by his former comrades in the army who are regularly employed by him and he says much to his satisfaction and profit people have got to work now it is creditable to them to do so their bodies and their minds are benefited by it and those who can and will work will be advanced by it you will never prosper with blacks and it is abhorrent to a reflecting mind to be supporting and cherishing those who are plotting and working for your injury and all of whose sympathies and associations are antagonistic to yours i wish them no evil in the worldon the contrary will do them every good in my power and know that they are misled by those to whom they have given their confidence but our material social and political interests are naturally with the whites mr davis trial was fixed for the last of this month if judge chases presence is essential i do not see how it can take place unless that of mr johnson is to be postponed i suppose that will be decided today or tomorrow and then i shall know what to expect i shall not go to richmond unless necessary as it is always inconvenient for me to leave home and i am not at all well your poor mother is also more ailing than she is ordinarily in consequence of a cold she has taken but it is passing away i trust i must leave you to her and mildred for all local and domestic news custis and the boys are well and powhattie i hope has got rid of the chills we hear regularly from mary and agnes who seem to be enjoying themselves and i do not think from their programme that they will get back to us till summer all unite in much love and i am always your father r e lee this same month he writes a long letter to his daughter agnes who was visiting friends in baltimore the annette mildred and mary he mentions in this letter were the daughters of charles henry carter of goodwood maryland a first cousin of my father lexington virginia march 28 1868 my precious agnes i was so glad to receive your letter to learn that you were well and enjoying yourself among pleasant friends i hope that you will soon get through all your visits and come home your uncle smith says you girls ought to marry his sons as you both find it so agreeable to be from home and you could then live a true bohemian life and have a happy time generally but i do not agree with him i shall not give my consent so you must choose elsewhere i have written to annette telling her of my alarm for her now that mildred is engaged and she sees how much mary is in love i fear she will pick up an adonis next so that she had better run away to the mountains at once i am glad that you saw mr davis it is a terrible thing to have this prosecution hanging over him and to be unable to fix his thoughts on a course of life or apply his hands to the support of his family but i hope a kind providence will shield and guide him you must remember me to all my friends the taggarts glenns mckims marshalls etc as to the young ladies you mention you must tell them that i want to see them very much and hope that they will all come to the mountains this summer and not pass us by in lexington when you go to goodwood and the eastern shore do the same there for me and present me to all by name tell sweet sallie warwick i think she ought to come to lexington if only to show those babies but in truth the want to see her more than them so she may leave them with major poor her husband if she chooses you must see everybody you wish and enjoy yourself as much as you can and then come home i told mildred to tell you if you wanted any funds you must let me know and where to send them i do not know whether she delivered my message she has become very imperious and may not think you require any she has been much exercised of late on the score of servants but hopes to get some relief on the 1st proximo from the promised change of miss mary dixon to miss eliza cyrus i hope her expectations may be realised little mildred has had a return of her chills it has been a sharp attack and thought it has been arrested when i left her this morning i feared she might have a relapse as this is her regular day she was looking remarkably well before it came on better than she had ever done but every cold terminates in this way however slight it may be colds have been quite prevalent and there have been two deaths among the cadets from pneumonia fortunately so far the students have escaped i am relieved of mine i hope and your poor mother is i hope better the storm seems to have subsided and i trust the bright weather may ameliorate her pains custis mildred and the boys are well as are most of our friends in lexington fitzhugh writes that everything is blooming at the white house and that his wheat is splendid i am in hopes that it is all due to the presence of my fair daughter rob says that things at romancoke are not so prosperousyou see there is no mrs r e lee jr there and that may make the difference cannot you persuade some of those pretty girls in baltimore to take compassion on a poor bachelor i will give them a plan for a house if they will build it all would unite with me in love if they knew i was writing you ought to be here to enjoy the birds captain o c h sends us with much love for yourself and my poor prayers for your happiness i am your devoted father r e lee a few days afterward he writes to his son fitzhugh who was now established very happily in his new house and warns him not to depend entirely on sentiment but to arrange for something material he also speaks of mr davis and his trial which was continually being postponed and in the end was dismissed and gives him some good advice about importing cattle lexington virginia march 30 1868 my dear fitzhugh i was very glad to receive your letter of the 19th and as you are aware of the order of the court postponing mr daviss trial till the 14th proximo i presume that you have not been expecting me down i see it stated in the washington star that the trial is again postponed till may 4th but i have seen as yet no order from the court mr and mrs davis went from baltimore to new york on tuesday last and were to go on to canada he said that he did not know what he should do or what he could turn his hand to for support as long as this trial is hanging over him of course he can do nothing he can apply his mind to nothing nor could he acquire the confidence of the business community in anything he might undertake from the apprehension of his being interrupted in the midst of it agnes and mary saw them as they passed through baltimore they say mr davis was well though he had changed a great deal since they saw him last i am very glad that you are so pleased with your house i think it must be my daughter that gives it such a charm i am sure that she will make everything look bright to me it is a good thing that the wheat is doing so well for i am not sure that the flame you are so rich in will light a fire in the kitchen nor the little god turn the spit spit spit some material element is necessary to make it burn brightly and furnish some good dishes for the table shad are good in their way but they do not run up the pamunkey all the year i am glad that you are making arrangements for some cows and think you are right in getting those of the best breed it used to be thought that cows from the north would not prosper in that lower country and indeed cows from the upper part of virginia did not succeed well but were apt to become sick and die and that the surest process to improve the stock was to purchase calves of good breed and cross on the native stock you must therefore be careful and not invest too much we have had a cold winter and march has been particularly harsh still vegetation is progressing and the wheat around lexington looks beautiful my garden is advancing in a small way pease spinach and onions look promising but my hotbed plants are poor the new house about which you inquire is in statu quo before winter i believe the money is wanting and the workmen cannot proceed we require some of that latter article here as elsewhere and have but little i heard of you in richmond the other day but did not learn whether my daughter was with you i wish you would send her up to her papa when you go away with much love your devoted father r e lee a month later he writes me telling me that he expects to be in richmond the following week and will try to get down to see us also telling of his garden and horse and as he always did encouraging cheering me and offering help lexington virginia april 25 1868 my dear rob your letter of the 21st is just received i am very glad that your wheat is improving in appearance and hope that at harvest it will yield a fair return for your care and labour your corn i am sure will be more remunerative than the crop of last year and i trust that at the end of the year you will find you have advanced in the field of agriculture your mule and provender was a heavy loss you must make it up replace the first by a good one and i will pay for it i hope the warm sun will bring forward the grass to supply the latter should i go to richmond next week as i now expect i will be prepared to pay for the mule and if i do not i will send you a check for the amount i am sorry to hear that you have not been well you must get out of that too you must refresh yourself when you can by going up to the white house to see your brother and sister take a good look at the latter for me in our garden nothing is up but the hardy plans pease potatoes spinach onions etc beets carrots salsify etc have been sown a long time but are not up and i cannot put in the beans squash etc or set out the hotbed plants but we can wait i have not been as well this winter as usual and have been confined of late i have taken up traveller however who is as rough as a bear and have had two or three rides on him in the mud which i think has benefited me mildred sometimes accompanies me your mother i am glad to say is better she has less pain than when i last wrote and is more active on her crutches goodbye my dear son if i go to richmond i will try to get to see you affectionately your father r e lee r e lee jr my father came to richmond summoned to attend the trial of mr davis but when he arrived he found that it was again postponed so he went to the white house and spent several days i came up from romancoke and stayed with him till he left it was a great pleasure to him to meet his sons and to see his new daughter in her new home after his return to lexington he wrote to her this letter lexington viriginia may 29 1868 my dear daughter i have been enjoying the memory ever since my return my visit to the pamunkey and whenever i have thought of writing to you the pleasure i experienced in your company and in that of fitzhugh and robert absorbed the moment i could devote to a letter and other calls made me postpone it but i have thought of you often and always with renewed pleasure and i rejoice at your having around you more comforts and within your reach more pleasures than i had anticipated i pray that both may be increased and be long continued there is one thing i regretthat you are so far from us i know the difficulty of farmers and their wives leaving home their success and in a measure their pleasure depend upon their daily attention to their affairs and it is almost an impossibility for us old people to get to you yet i trust we may meet this summer some time and whenever you can you must come and see us our small house will never be so full that there will not be room for you or so empty that you will not be most cordially welcome letters received from mary and agnes report them still on the eastern shore of maryland where they were detained by the sickness of agnes they expected however to be able to return to baltimore last tuesday 26th where after a few days sojourn they were to go to mrs washington peters i fear however that agnes might not have been well enough as she had had an attack of bilious fever and was much prostrated should you find yourself in danger of becoming sick you must come right up to your papa i know you will pine but i would rather you should suffer in that way than burn with fever and while on that subject i will tell you something that may be of comfort you may reasonably expect fitzhugh soon to follow so you will not suffer long i wish to take your mama to the warm springs and to the hot or healing if she will go to try to obtain for her some relief but we will not leave home till the last of june or first of july i am so much occupied that i feel that i ought never to go away and every absence accumulates my work i had a pleasant visit of three days to lynchburg attending the episcopal convention and i have not yet brought up my correspondence etc i fear too i shall have to go to richmond next week as everything seems to portend the certainty of mr daviss trial god grant that like the impeachment of mr johnson it may be dismissed if i do go i fear i shall have no time to visit you the examinations of the senior classes of the college are now in progress and after their completion the examination of the undergraduates will commence and will not terminate till the 15th of june and the commencement exercises them begin and end on the 18th so you see how necessary it is for me to be here and that i shall be obliged to hasten back as soon as permitted i wanted if possible to pass one day at shirleyi have not been there for ten years it was the loved home of my mother and a spot where i have passed many happy days in early life and one that probably i may never visit again but i do not know that i shall be able we are all as usual and all would send much love if they knew i was writing mildred is very happing in the company of miss charlotte haxall and custis retains his serenity of character our young members of the family are looking forward to their return to powhatan as soon as the college exercises close which i hope will bring some relief to me also i see that you have been much visited of late but you know that no one wants to see you as much as i do tell fitzhugh that his old friend miss helen peters has come to lexington from new york to pass the summer she is now mrs taylor and has brought with her two babies she is as cordial and affectionate as ever give much love to fitzhugh and rob and believe me always your devoted father r e lee mrs wm h fitzhugh lee my father was back at the college in full time for the final examinations he always made it a point to be present and took his full share of sitting in the rooms while the students were working on their papers when occasion offered somewhat to the surprise of the learned faculty he showed himself thoroughly conversant with each and every department even with greek he seems somewhat familiar and would question the students as to their knowledge of this language much to their astonishment the commencement exercises of the college began about june 1st and lasted a week at this time the town was crowded with visitors and my father had his house full generally of young girls friends of my sisters who came to assist at the final ball the great social event connected with this college exercise he seemed to enjoy their society as much as the young men did though he could not devote so much time to them as the boys did and i know that the girls enjoyed his society more than they did that of their college adorers on the occasion of an entertainment at his house in going amongst his guests he approached a young lady a great belle completely surrounded by her admirersstudents cadets and some old confeds he stopped and began to rally her on her conquests saying you can do as you please to these other young gentlemen but you must not treat any of my old soldiers badly those who have never known him cannot imagine the charm of his manner the brightness of his smile and the pleasant way he had of speaking especially to young people and little children his rebukes to the young were administered in the kindest gentlest way almost persuasively but he could be stern when the occasion demanded colonel william preston johnston a member of his faculty and a very dear and trusted friend says in his intercourse with his faculty he was courteous kind and often rather playful in manner we all thought he deferred entirely too much to the expression of opinion on the part of the faculty when we would have preferred that he should simply indicate his own views or desire one characteristic of general lee i noted then and have often recalled i never saw him take an ungraceful posture no matter how long or fatiguing a faculty meeting might be he always preserved an attitude in which dignity decorum and grace were united he was a very well built man with rounded body and limbs and seemed without the slightest affectation of effort to sit or stand or walk just as a gentleman should he was never in a hurry and all his gestures were easy and significant he was always an agreeable companion there was a good deal of bonhomie and pleasantry in his conversation he was not exactly witty nor was he very humorous though he gave a light turn to tabletalk and enjoyed exceedingly any pleasantry or fun even he often made a quaint or slightly caustic remark but he took care that it should not be too trenchant on reading his letters one discovers this playful spirit in many of them as for instance in his letter to the spiritualist who asked his opinion of von moltke and the french war he wrote in reply a most courteous letter in which he said that the question was one about which military critics would differ that his own judgement about such matters was poor at best and that inasmuch as they had the power to consult through their mediums caesar alexander napoleon wellington and all of the other great captains who had ever lived he could not think of obtruding his opinion in such company general lee did not talk politics but he felt very deeply the condition of the country and expressed to me several times in strong terms his disapproval of the course of the dominant party there is a story told of my father which points to his playful manner here alluded to at a certain faculty meeting they were joking mr harris who so long and so ably filled the chair of latin about his walking up the aisle of the presbyterian church with the stem of his pipe protruding from his pocket mr harris took out the offending stem and began cutting it shorter my father who had been enjoying the incident said no mr harris dont do that next time leave it at home sometimes he deemed it advisable to be a little stern one of the young professors went off for a few days without asking the presidents permission on his return the general met him very stiffly saying mr i congratulate you on your return to your friends and duties i was not aware of your absence until i heard it by chance mr told this on himself and added that it was the last time he ever went away without a formal leave of absence his particularity in little things has often been commented on he applied it to all his affairs dr kirkpatrick professor of moral philosophy came into the presidents office and asked for a certain paper my father told him where it could be found after a while turning to the doctor he said did you find the paper yes general replied the doctor did you return it to the place where you found it yes general at another time he asked professor harris to look at a catalogue on the table the professor took up a new one wrapped ready for the mail and was about to tear the cover off when my father hastily handing him one already opened said take this if you please my mother used to say that he could go in the dar and lay his hand on any article of his clothing or upon any particular paper after he had once arranged them provided they had not been disturbed one of his quaint or slightly caustic remarks alluded to by colonel johnston i recall as told to me he met a lady friend down in the town who bitterly complained that she could get nothing to eat in lexington suitable for lentno fish no oysters etc mrs the general replied i would not trouble myself so much about special dishes i suppose if we try to abstain from special sins that is all that will be expected of us goes to warm springs for rheumatismher daughter mildred takes typhoid thereremoves to hot springsher husbands devotionvisit of fitzhugh and bride to lexingtonmiss jones a wouldbe benefactor of washington collegefate of washington relics belonging to mrs lees family that summer my father determined to take my mother to the warm springs in bath county virginia hoping that the baths there might be of service to her and purposing if she was not benefited to go to the hot springs five miles distant he was most anxious that his new daughter should join her there and go with him to any place she might select and come back with them to lexington in the following letter to his son he tells of his plans for the summer lexington virginia july 1 1868 my dear fitzhugh i received yesterday your letter of the 28th ultimo and regret very much to learn of tabbs indisposition i hope that she will soon be well and i wish very much she would join us in the mountains and return here with us in my letter to her about the time when she went to her sisters wedding which i hope she got i told her of my wishes on the subject and believe gave her our general plans i can now say with more distinctness that unless something now unforeseen should prevent i will take your mother to the warm sprints from the 10th to the 15th inst and after trying the water there about two weeks if not favourable will take her over to the hot after seeing her comfortably established i will then go anywhere tabb desiresto the healing or the white sulphur or sweet i intend to go myself to the white sulphur for about a fortnight to drink the water and will take mildred with me agnes having gone last summer will not care to go i presume and can remain with her mother mildred has been quite sick for the past week but is now much better and in a week will be strong enough for the journey i think if not we shall have to delay our departure a little agnes was also sick on the eastern shore of maryland about three weeks and i am told looks badly she is now at the university of virginia and will be home in a few days and go with us to the springs you must arrange your plans to suit your interests and convenience coming to us when you can and staying as long as you can you know the interest i take in your prosperity and advancement which cannot be assured without earnest attention to your business on your part and therefore i never urge you to act contrary to your own judgement in reference to them as to my daughter tabb tell her if she will trust herself to her papa she shall never want anything he can do for her and i think she will find the prediction in my letter to her verified she might join us at goshen and go with us or come here why did she not come up with her father i went to see him last evening but he was out your mother i presume has told you of home affairs she has become nervous of late and broods over her troubles so much that i fear it increases her sufferings i am therefore the more anxious to give her new scenes and new thoughts it is the principal good i anticipate love to rob custis still talks of visiting you but i have not heard of his having fixed the day of his departure he is quite well with my best love to my daughter t and the same to yourself i am most affectionately your father r e lee the morning he left lexington he while waiting for the stage writes as follows to a great favourite of his a friend of mildreds who had been on a visit to her that summer lexington virginia july 14 1868 the stage is at the door to carry us to goshen and if mrs lees strength permits we hope to reach the warm springs tonight after two or three weeks trial of its waters we shall go to the hot where leaving agnes to take care of her mother i shall take mildred to the white sulphur and hope to meet you at covington and carry you along will you not come mildred is quite well again and is flying about this morning with great activity agnes is following with slower steps mrs lee is giving her last injunctions to sam and eliza letitia my mothers maid is looking on with wonder at the preparations and trying to get a right conception of the place to which she is going which she seems to think is something between a steeltrap and a springgun custis is waiting to help his mother into the stage and you see how patient i am to add interest to the scene dr barton has arrived to bid adieu and to give mildred an opportunity of looking her best i believe he is the last rose of summer the others with their fragrance and thorns have all departed a few days after their arrival at the warm springs mildred was taken ill with typhoid fever and during many anxious weeks my father and agnes were her only nurses my mothers room was on the first floor of the brockenborough cottage my sisters in the second so she could not get upstairs to her room mildred was very fancifulwould not have no one but my father to nurse her and could not sleep unless she had his hand in hers night after night he sat by her side watching over her and attending to every want with gentleness and patience he writes to the same young lady at mildreds request warm springs virginia july 30 1868 she mildred has been so anxious to write to you and so uneasy at her inability to do so that i hope you will permit me to tell you the reason she has been quite sick and is so stillconfined to her bed with low fever which retains its hold very pertinaciously she took cold a few days after our arrival from some imprudence and she is very much enfeebled she has been more comfortable the last day or two and i hope is better but i presume he recovery will necessarily be slow you know she is very fanciful and as she seems to be more accessible to reason from me i have come be her chief nurse and am now writing in her room while she is sleeping this is a beautiful valley and we have quite a pleasant companymr and mrs chapman and their three daughters from alabama mrs coleman and her two daughters from baltimore some ladies from richmond washington kentucky iowa etc and an everchanging scene of faces as soon as mildred is strong enough we will go to the hot after which if she desires it i will take her to the white mrs lee and agnes are improving slightly i am glad to say we hear of many friends at the hot healing and white and hope we shall reach these respective waters before they depart the harrisons have written me that they will be here on the 14th proximo but unless mildreds recovery is much retarded it will be too late for me to see them the caskies will be at the hot about the same time i am your most sincerely r e lee on august 3d from the same place he writes to my brother fitzhugh this was the day i had appointed to go to the hot but mildred is too sick to move she was taken more than a fortnight sinceand her attack seems to have partaken of a typhoid character she has had since a low and persistent fever which retains its hold she is very feeble but in the doctors opinion somewhat better i myself see little change except that she is now free from pain i cannot speak of our future movements i fear i shall have to abandon my visit to the white your mother and agnes are better than when they arrived the former bathes freely eats generously and sleeps sweetly agnes though feeble is stronger i am the same and can see no effects of the waters upon myself give much love to my sweet daughter and dear sons all unite with me in this message i am as ever and always your father r e lee another letter to my brother fitzhugh from the warm springs tells of his daughters convalescence smiths island of which he writes belonged to my grandfathers estate of which my father was executor he was trying to make some disposition of it so that it might yield a revenue it is situated on the atlantic just east of cape charles in northampton county virginia warm springs virginia august 14 1868 my dear fitzhugh i received yesterday your letter of the 9th and as your mother informed you of mildreds condition i deferred replying to it until today i am glad to inform you that she is better and that the doctor pronounces her convalescent this morning he says her progress must necessarily be slow but with care and prudence he sees nothing to prevent her recovery unless something unforeseen occurs i hope therefore we may dismiss our anxiety as regards smiths island i should be very glad if you could go over and see it and if you think proper make such disposition of it as you and robert think most advantageous see mr hamilton s neale eastville northampton county virginia and consult with him on the subject and let me know your determination i think you will find him kind and intelligent i have visited the island twice in my life a long while ago and thought that if a person lived on it he might by grazing planting and fishing make a comfortable living you and robert might if you choose buy the island from the estate i fear the timber etc has been cut from it i never thought it as valuable as your grandfather did you will have to go to norfolk take the steamer to cherrystone where i suppose you can find a conveyance to eastville you know cobbs island has been a fashionable bathingplace john lewis wrote that the beach was delightful and fare excellent and that they had sailvessels there at the disposal of visitors but mr neale and mr john simpkins the present agent can put you in the way of visiting the island and you might carry my sweet daughter tabb over and give her a surf bath but do not let the mosquitoes annoy her give her much love from me i am writing in mildreds room who is very grateful for your interest in her behalf she is too weak to speak i hope rob had a pleasant trip tell me custiss plans i have not heard from him your mother and agnes unite in love to you rob and tabb i have a fan in one hand while i wield a pen with the other so excuse brevity most affectionately yours r e lee psgeorge and eleanor goldsborough and miss mary g express themselves as much pleased with cobbs island i do not know how far it is east of smiths island r e lee his daughter being convalescent he carried out his plan and went over to the white sulphur springs after he had placed my mother and sisters at the hot springs in a letter from there on august 28th he writes the place looks beautifulthe belles very handsome and the beaux very happy all are gay and only i solitary i am all alone there was a grand fancy masked ball last night the room was overflowing the music good as much spring in the boards as in the conversation and the german continued till two oclock this morning i return to the hot next week and the following to lexington mildred is much better but says she has forgotten how to write i hope that she will be strong enough to return with me i am truly and affectionately yours r e lee they all returned to lexington early in september in time for the opening of the college mildred was still weak and nervous nor did she recover her normal strength for several months she was always my fathers pet as a little girl and during this illness and convalescence he had been very tender with her humoring as far as he could all of her fancies not long before that christmas she enumerated just in fun all the present she wisheda long list to her great surprise when christmas morning came she found each article at her place a the breakfasttablenot one omitted his sympathy with all who were suffering ill and afflicted was warm and sincere colonel shipp now superintendent of the virginia military institute was the commandant of cadets when my father came to lexington he tells me that the he was ill for some weeks laid up in his room which was next to that of my brother custis he hardly knew general lee and had spoken to him only a few times but my father went to see him quite often would sit by him talk to him and seemed much interested in his getting well he said that he would consult mrs lee who is a great doctor and he finally brought a bottle of something in which sudorberries were the chief ingredient colonel shipp found out afterward that the sudorberries had been sent from the white house and that my mother had concocted the medicine on one occasion calling at colonel prestons he missed two little boys in the family circle who were great favourites of his and on asking for them he was told that they were confined to the nursery by croup the next day though the weather was of the worst description he went trudging in great stormboots back to their house carrying in one hand a basket of pecan nuts and in the other a toy which he left for his little sick friends to my mother who was a great invalid from rheumatism for more than ten years he was the most faithful attendant and tender nurse every want of hers that he could supply he anticipated his considerate forethought saved her from much pain and trouble during the war he constantly wrote to her even when on the march and amidst the most pressing duties every summer of their life in lexington he arranged that she should spend several months at one of the many medicinal springs in the neighbouring mountains as much that she might be surrounded by new scenes and faces as for the benefit of the waters whenever he was in the room the privilege of pushing her wheeled chair into the diningroom and out on the verandas or elsewhere about the house was yielded to him he sat with her daily entertaining her with accounts of what was doing in the college and the news of the village and would often read to her in the evening for her his love and care never ceased his gentleness and patience never ended this tenderness for the sick and helpless was developed in him when he was a mere lad his mother was an invalid and he was her constant nurse in her last illness he mixed every dose of medicine she took and was with her night and day if he left the room she kept her eyes on the door till he returned he never left her but for a short time after her death the health of their faithful servant nat became very bad my father then just graduated from west point took him to the south had the best medical advice a comfortable room and everything that could be done to restore him and attended to him himself i can find few family letters written by my father at this time those which have been preserved are to my brother fitzhugh and are mostly about smiths island and the settling up of my grandfathers estate the last of september he writes lexington virginia september 28 1868 my dear fitzhugh your report of the condition of smiths island corresponds with my own impressions based upon my knowledge of the island and the reports of others i think it would be advantageous under present circumstances to make sale of the island as soon as a fair price can be obtained and i have so instructed mr hamilton s neale who has consented to act as my agent i should like this while matter arranged as soon as possible for my life is very uncertain and its settlement now may avoid future difficulties i am very glad to hear that you and rob have continued well and that my daughter is improving give my love to them both the loss of your fine cows is a serious one and i believe you will have to procure them in your vicinity and improve them get some calves this fall of a good breed we hope that we shall see you this fall your mother is as comfortable as usual and mildred is improving custis mary and agnes are well and all would send love did they know i was writing very affectionately your father r e lee this autumn he had a visit from his nephew edward lee childe edward lived in paris and had crossed over in the summer to see my father and mother he made a very pleasant impression on everybody and was much pleased with his visit here is a letter written by my father to my brother just after edward left lexington virginia october 14 1868 my dear fitzhugh i have returned to mr hamilton s neale the advertisement of the sale of smiths island with my approval and have requested him to advertise in the northern and richmond papers etc and to send out such other notices as he deems best calculated to attract attention to the property and to take every measure to enhance the value of the island and to procure for your grandfathers estate the full benefit of the sale i have heard from mr compton that my daughter tabb has returned to the white house in improved health which i am very glad of i hope that you will soon be able to bring her up to see us do not wait until the weather becomes too cold our mountain atmosphere in winter is very harsh so far the weather has been delightful your cousin edward left us last thursday evening on his way to see you we enjoyed his visit greatly agnes and i rode down to the baths last saturday to see the harrisons and returned sunday evening they were well and somewhat benefited by their visit mr george ritchies death no doubt threw a shade of sadness over the whole party on mrs harrisons account though all were charming and miss belle very sweet we are about the sameyour poor mother comfortable mildred improving all would unite in love to you and yours did they know i was writing give much love to my dear daughter tabb and tell her that i want to see her very much truly and affectionately your father general w h fitzhugh lee r e lee in a few days he writes again still about smiths island but adds much about the family and friends lexington virginia october 19 1868 my dear fitzhugh i received your letter of the 12th the day i last wrote to you i am glad we agree that should be the minimum limit for the price of smiths island you will see by my letter referred to that it has been so fixed december 22d is the day proposed by mr neale as the time of public sale which was approved by me though i feared the notice might be too short still there are good reasons for the sale being made without unnecessary delay i think november which you suggest would not afford sufficient notice i would recommend that you and robert attend the sale and be governed by circumstances in what you do i would go myself but it would be a long hard journey for me at that season of the year and i do not see any material good that i can do mr neale kindly offered to meet me

i long to be on the water again but it cannot be with much love r e lee general wm h fitzhugh lee the last of october he went to staunton on some business he rode traveller and colonel wm allan rode with him it was the time of the augusta agricultural fair and while there he visited the exhibition and was received by the people with great demonstrations of delight a student standing by remarked dryly i dont see why the staunton people make all this to do over general lee why in lexington he sends for me to come to see him in a letter of november 2d he mentions this little journey i have recently paid a visit to staunton and saw the young people there they seemed very happy in their fair and the beaux with their belles i rode over on traveller and was accompanied by colonel allan the former was delighted at the length of the road and the latter relieved from an obstinate cold from which he was suffering on the second morning just as the knights were being marshalled to prove their prowess and devotion we commenced our journey back to lexington which we reached before nine p m under the light of a beautiful moon at this time his son fitzhugh and his new daughter paid their longpromised visit which he enjoyed immensely my mother and sisters were charmed with her and the entire community vied in paying her attention my father was proud of his daughterinlaw and much gratified at his sons marriage he was delighted with the manner in which she adapted herself to the ways of all her new relations with her sweet attention to my mother and above all with her punctuality she had been warned beforehand by her husband that to please his father she must be always ready for family prayers which were read every morning by him just before breakfast this she succeeded in doing never failing once to be on time as breakfast was at seven oclock it was no small feat for one not accustomed to such early hours she said afterward that she did not believe that general lee would have an entirely high opinion of any person even general washington if he could return to earth if he were not ready for prayers after a delightful visit of three weeks my brother and his wife returned home just as the latter was packing my father came into her room and filled all the space in the top of her trunk with pecan nuts which some friends had sent him from the south the hour fixed for the service in the college chapel was as i have said a quarter to eight oclock every morning except sunday in the three winter months december january and february it was one hour later as the president never failed to attend when not prevented by sickness or absence it was necessary to have an early breakfast after chapel he went to his office and was seated at his desk by eight oclock where he remained unless called out by public business till two pm this room was open to all in the college who had business with him the new students were required to report to him here in person and from their first interviews we obtained a knowledge of the young men of which he availed himself in their future career in the college as president he was always disposed to be lenient with students who were reported for disorderly conduct or for failure in their studies or duties he would say to the faculty when they seemed to think it necessary to send a student home dont you think it would be better to bear with him a little longer perhaps we may do him some good being sent for to this office was anything but pleasant to the students lewis one of the janitors went around with the names of those the president wanted to see written by his own hand on a long slip of paper he carried the paper in one hand a pencil in the other and when he could find the one he wanted in a crowd of his comrades he took special pleasure in serving his notice and would say in his solemn sepulchral voice mr the president wants to see you at the office then mr took the pencil and made a crossmark opposite his name which was evidence of his having received his summons what transpired at these interviews was seldom known except as the student himself might reveal it for unless it became necessary to summon the delinquent a second time the president never alluded to the subject an old student writes me the following account of his experience in the presidents office i was a frolicsome chap at college and having been absent from class an unreasonable number of times was finally summoned to the generals office abject terror took possession of me in the presence of such wise and quiet dignity the reasons i had carefully prepared to give for my absence stood on their heads or toppled over in reply to general lees grave but perfectly polite question i stammered out a story about a violent illness and the conscious that i was at that moment the picture of health i hastened on with something about leaving my boots at the cobblers when general lee interrupted me stop mr m he said stop sir one good reason is enough but i could not be mistaken about the twinkle in the old heros eyes only a few cases required more than one summons to appear at the office no instance is known where a student complained of injustice or harshness and the effect on his mind was that of greater respect and admiration for the president the new house was approaching completion and my father was much interested in the work going there very often and discussing with the workmen their methods that christmas i spent two weeks in lexington and many times my father took me all over the new building explaining all the details of his plan all of his family were here together this christmas except fitzhugh and his wife an occurrence rather rare of late years my fathers health was unusually good and he was bright and almost gay he rode out often taking me with him as it was too cold for the girls he also took me around with him visiting and in the mild festivities of the neighbours he joined with evident pleasure my visit ended all too soon and the first week of january i started back to the low country soon after my departure he forwarded a letter to me with the accompanying one of his own lexington virginia january 14 1869 my dear rob the accompanying letter was inclosed to me by lawrence butler the grandson of nellie custis my grandfathers sister who married lawrence lewis the favourite nephew of washington with the request that i would forward it as he did not know your address and urge you to be present at his wedding i do not know that i can say more except to inform you that he says he has the very girl for you if you will come on you must therefore decide the question according to your best judgment general hoke from north carolina has also sent you his weddingcards we have missed you very much since your departure and wished you back i hope you got home comfortably and found all well drive all your work with judgment and energy and when you have decided about the house let me know tell fitzhugh i have signed the insurance policy and sent it to mr wickham for his signature with the request that he forward it to grubb williams the weather still continues pleasant and i fear we shall suffer for it by the late spring there has so far been a great lack of snow and consequently the wheat is exposed to the great changes of temperature we are all as you left us custis i think looks better no news mail heavy this morning love to f and t with great affection your father r e lee r e lee jr some one wrote to general lee suggesting that general grant then president of the united states should be invited to washington college his reply was as follows lexington virginia january 8 1869 my dear sir i am much obliged to you for you letter of the 29th ult which i am sure has been prompted by the best motives i should be glad if general grant would visit washington college and i should endeavour to treat him with the courtesy and respect due the president of the united states but if i were to invite him to do so it might not be agreeable to him and i fear my motives might be misunderstood at this time both by himself and others and that evil would result instead of good i will however bear your suggestion in mind and should a favourable opportunity offer i shall be glad to take advantage of it wishing you happiness and prosperity i am very respectfully your obedient servant r e lee a lady living in new york wrote to general lee in 1867 asking for a catalogue of washington college and a copy of its charter and laws she wished also to know whether or not the college was sectarian and if so of what denomination she intimated that she desired to make a donation to some institution of learning and was rather inclined to select the episcopal theological seminary near alexandria virginia the president sent her the following reply to her letter lexington virginia june 24 1867 miss ann upshur jones no 156 lafayette avenue brooklyn n y my dear madam i have had the honour to receive your letter of the 17th inst and i send to your address a catalogue of washington college and a copy of its charter and laws on the thirtyseventh page of the former and the eleventh of the latter you will find what is prescribed on the subject of religion i do not know that it ever has been sectarian in its character since it was chartered as a college but it certainly is not so now located in a presbyterian community it is natural that most of its trustees and faculty should be of that denomination though the rector president and several of the professors are members of the episcopal church it is furthest from my wish to divert any donation from the theological seminary at alexandria for i am well acquainted with the merits of that institution have a high respect for its professors and am an earnest advocate of its object i only give you the information you desire and wish you to follow your own preferences in the matter with great respect your obedient servant r e lee in 1869 she wrote again stating that she proposed breaking up housekeeping that she had no family to whom to give her books furniture and silver that she did not wish to sell them nor store them away and had therefore determined to present them to the greatest living man and she begged him to accept them or if his house was already furnished to make use of them in his college to this letter he replied lexington virginia february 13 1869 my dear miss jones after long and diligent inquiry i only this moment learned your address and have been during this time greatly mortified at my inability to acknowledge the receipt and disposition of your valuable and interesting donation to washington college the books were arranged in the library on their arrival the globes in the philosophical department while the furniture carpets sofas chairs etc have been applied to the furnishing of the dais of the audienceroom of the new chapel to the comfort and ornament of which they are a great addition i have yet made no disposition of the plate and tableware and they are still in the boxes in which they came i inclose the resolution of thanks passed by the board of trustees of the college at their annual meeting to which i beg to add my personal acknowledgments and grateful sense of your favour and kindness to this institution it would give me great pleasure if you would visit lexington at the commencement in june next the third thursday that i might then show you the successful operation of the college mrs lee joins me in sentiments of esteem and regard praying that the great and merciful god may throw around you his protecting care and love i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee miss ann upshur jones no 38 union square new york the plate tableware and a curious old worktable for which no place could be found in the college valuable only on account of their antiquity and quaintness he finally allowed to be called his own when my mother hurriedly left her home in the spring of 1861 she found it impossible to carry away the valuable relics of general washington which her father had inherited from mount vernon and which had been objects of great interest at arlington for more than fifty years after the federal authorities took possession of the place the most valuable of these mount vernon relics were conveyed to washington city and placed in the patent office where they remained on exhibition for many years labelled captured from arlington they were then removed to the national museum where they are now but the card has been taken off in 1869 a member of congress suggested to my mother that she should apply to president johnson to have them restored to her in a letter from my father to this same gentleman this bit of quiet humour occurs lexington virginia february 12 1869 mrs lee has determined to act upon your suggestion and apply to president johnson for such of the relics from arlington as are in the patent office from what i have learned a great many things formerly belonging to general washington bequeathed to her by her father in the shape of books furniture camp equipage etc were carried away by individuals and are now scattered over the land i hope the possessors appreciate them and may imitate the example of their original owners whose conduct must at times be brought to their recollection by these silent monitors in this way they will accomplish good to the country he refers to this same subject in a letter to the honourable george w jones dubuque iowa in reference to certain articles which were taken from arlington about which you inquire mrs lee is indebted to our old friend captain james may for the order from the present administration forbidding their return they were valuable to her as having belonged to her greatgrandmother mrs general washington and having been bequeathed to her by her father but as the country desires them she must give them up i hope their presence at the capital will keep in the remembrance of all americans the principles and virtues of washington to the honourable thomas lawrence jones who endeavoured to have the order to restore the relics to mrs lee executed the following letter of thanks was written lexington virginia march 29 1869 honourable thomas lawrence jones washington city district of columbia my dear sir i beg to be allowed to tender you my sincere thanks for your efforts to have restored to mrs lee certain family relics in the patent office in washington the facts related in your speech in the house of representatives on the 3d inst so far as known to me are correct and had i conceived the view taken of the matter by congress i should have endeavoured to dissuade mrs lee from applying for them it may be a question with some whether the retention of these articles is more an insult in the language of the committee on public buildings to the loyal people of the united states than their restoration but of this i am willing that they should be the judge and since congress has decided to keep them she must submit however her thanks to you sir are not the less fervent for your kind intercession in her behalf and with highest regards i am with great respect your obedient servant r e lee washingtons opinion of this transaction if it could be obtained would be of interest to many americans these relics were restored to the family in 1903 by the order of president mckinley the building of roberts housethe general as a railroad delegatelionised in baltimorecalls on president grantvisits alexandriadeclines to be interviewedinterested in his grandsonthe washington portraits my father being very anxious that i should build a good house on my farm had agreed to supply the necessary means and was interested in my plans and estimates in a letter of february 18th after a long and full explanation of the arrangements for the purchase of smiths island by fitzhugh and myself he writes i am glad that you are considering the construction of your house and taking steps in the matter let me know how you advance the amount of its cost etc and when i can help you the fine weather we have had this winter must have enabled you to advance in your farm work and put you ahead in that so you will come out square i hope we are as usual your poor mother about the same the girls well and i tolerable all unite in much love truly and affectionately r e lee a week later he writes to me on the same subject lexington virginia february 27 1869 my dear son i am glad you have obtained a good pair of oxen try to get another pair to work with them i will make good the deficit in my contribution your fences will be a great advantage to you and i am delighted at the good appearance of your wheat i hope it will continue to maturity it is very probable as you say however that it may fail in the grain should you find it so would it not be well next year to experiment with phosphates that must be the quality the land lacks have you yet heard from mr west about your house what are the estimates let me know the difficulty i fear now will be that the burning of the bricks may draw you away from your crops you must try not to neglect them what would the bricks cost if purchased ask f to cut the lumber for you i will furnish the funds to pay for it i hope the break in the mill will not prove serious and that you may be able to make up your delay in plowing occasioned by the necessary hauling i am very glad to hear that you and f can visit each other so easily it will be advantageous to communicate with each other as well as a pleasure i suppose tabb has not returned to the white house yet i am delighted to hear that she and her boy are so well they will make everything on the pamunkey shine we are all as usual general breckenridge general john c breckenridge of kentucky exsecretary of war of the confederate south had two sons at washington college at this time one of them was since united states minister a the court of st petersburg is on a visit to his sons and has been with us today he will return to baltimore monday he looks well seems cheerful and talks hopefully all unite in love to you and your acquaintances inquire regularly after you i think of you very often and wish i were nearer and could assist you custis is in better health this winter than he has been and seems content though his sisters look after him very closely i have no news and never have general b saw fitzhugh lee in alexandria he told him he was a great farmer now and when he was away his father who had now taken to the land showed uncommon signs of management goodbye my dear son may you enjoy every happiness prays your affectionate father r e lee robert e lee jr the completion of the railroad from the white house to west point made communication between fitzhugh and myself very easy on february 11th my father had become the proud and happy possessor of a grandson which event gave him great joy mr west an architect of richmond had drawn me up plans and estimates for a house my father had also sent me a plan drawn by himself these plans i had submitted to several builders and sent their bids to him to examine and consider in the following letter he gives me his opinion lexington virginia march 21 1869 my dear rob i have received your two letters of the 3d and 9th insts and would have answered the former before but had written a few days before its date and as our letters had been crossing each other i determined to let them get right first as to smiths island i merely want to fulfil the conditions of the sale as prescribed in the published notice i should have required them of any other purchasers and must require them of you now as for the house the estimates of your bidders are higher than i anticipated and i think too high by at least 1000 you see there is about 1000 difference between the highest and lowest of their offers you sent me what does f say about it i am confident that the could build that house here for but little over 2000 including materials and i could to it there if i could get two good workmen but you are unaccustomed to building and i would not advise you to undertake it unless you could engage a proper foreman if therefore i were in your place i should reject all the offers unless the one you had not received when you wrote suited better i would not however give up my house but procure the bricks either by purchase or by making them on the ground as was most advantageous and the shingles in the same way and get all the lumber and flooring prepared while preparing the necessary materials i would see the builder that made the lowest offer or any other that i preferred and get him to revise his estimate and cut it down leaving him a margin for profit and when satisfied with his offer accept it and set him to work now as for the means i understood when you were here that you could manage the materialsthat is make arrangements for procuring the bricks lumber shingles and flooring indeed you might also get the lime and sand cheaper perhaps than the builder and make a deduction on his bill i can let you have funds to pay your contractor if i did not understand you rightlythat is if you cannot procure the materials i can help you in them too in fact if you desire so much i can let you have the whole amount 3500 you can have the use of it without interest and return it to me when i require it or sooner if you are able as i take it from the fund i was saving for a homestead for your mother at present i cannot use it and it is of no advantage to me except its possession will that suit you if it does not let me know what will and you shall have that too you must feel that it gives me pleasure to do anything i can for you and if i had only myself to consider you should have it unconditionally but i must consider one person above all i want you to do therefore just as you prefer i want you to have the comfort of a house but i do not wish to force one upon you against your will or against your judgement i merely wish you to feel that you can procure one without inconveniencing me the only hesitation i have on the subject is that i think you ought to get a better house for 3500 than i fear you will get the house according to the first plan in my opinion ought not to cost more than that sum but if you think the estimate is a fair one and are satisfied accept it and set to work but consult fitzhugh and let me know when you want the money and in what sums now that is plain i hope so keep this letter for reference as i have not time to take a copy we are all pretty well your mother has been troubled by a cold but is over it i hope the girls are well and have as many opinions with as few acts as ever and custis is soso we have had accounts of lawrence butlers wedding and all were as gay as a flock of snowbirds they regretted your absence i will ask your mother to send you reports i am tolerable and wish i could get down to see you i had hoped to go down this spring but i fear the dilatoriness of the workmen in finishing the house and the necessity of my attending to it getting the ground inclosed and preparing the garden will prevent me i shall also have to superintend the moving in fact it never seems convenient for me to go away give much love to f my daughter tabb and grandson i wonder what he will think of his grandpa all unite in love and i am as always your affectionate father r e lee robert e lee jr in april there are two letters written on the same day to each of his sons fitzhugh and myself i had determined for many reasons to postpone building my house for the present which decision my father regrets in the matter of smiths island the arrangements proposed by my brother and myself for its purchase was agreed to by him lexington virginia april 17 1869 my dear rob i have written to fitzhugh informing him of my agreement to al the propositions in your joint letter which i hope will be satisfactory to you you can read my letter to him so i will not repeat i am sorry that you have concluded not to build but if in your judgment that is the best course i must be content i do not wish you to hamper yourself with obligations but to my mind building in the way proposed would not be onerous to you and would have given you the use of a house some years prior to the time that you may be able to erect one and thus have added to your comfort health and probable ability to increase your resources from your farm but i hoe you have decided wisely and should circumstances occur to cause you to change your views you must not fail to let me know for i shall at all times stand ready to help you to the extent of my ability which i am now obliged to husband lest i may become a burden to others i am very glad to learn that your farm is promising better in the second cultivation of the fields and feel assured that if treated judiciously it will recover its fertility and be remunerative if you can perceive that you are progressing though with a slow and regular step you have cause for congratulation and encouragement for there are many i am sorry to say that are worse off now than when they commenced at the end of the war and have to begin again industry with economy must prevail in the end there seems to be a necessity for my going to baltimore next tuesday but i feel so poorly now that i do not know that i shall be able if i do go it will interfere materially with my proposed visit to you and fitzhugh this spring and i fear will put an end to it i shall be obliged to spend some days in alexandria on my return and could not then delay my return here i hope to see you both some time this summer and if i cannot get to you you must come to me i have been confined to this house for more than a week with a bad cold the effects of which still cling to me and thought i am better this morning i am suffering your mother too i am sorry to say has been suffering from the same cause and has had to resort to medicine as well as myself you know that is bad for old people agnes has not been well but mildred is herself and surrounded by her two fresh broods of kittens she would not call the king her unclegod bless you my dear son prays your affectionate father r e lee r e lee jr the letter to his son fitzhugh is mostly upon business but some of it relates to more interesting matters lexington virginia april 17 1869 my dear fitzhugh i expect to go to baltimore next tuesday if well enough the valley railroad company are very anxious for me to accompany their delegation to that city with a view of obtaining from the mayor or council a subscription for their road and though i believe i can be of no service to them they have made such a point of it that it would look illmannered and unkind to refuse i wish i could promise myself the pleasure of returning by the white house but i cannot if i go to baltimore i must take time to pay certain visits and must stop a while in alexandria i shall therefore from there be obliged to return here if i could stop there on my way to baltimore which i cannot for want of time i would then return by the white house i shall hope however to see you and rob during the summer if i have to go down immediately after commencement but it is so inconvenient for me to leave home now that i cannot say poor little agnes also has been visited by doctor barton of late but she is on the mend life holds her own both of her cats have fresh broods of kittens and the world wags cheerily with her custis is well and mary is still in new york and all unite with me in much love to you and my daughter tabb and my grandson i hope the latter has not formed the acquaintance of his father in the same manner as warrington carters child your affectionate father r e lee general wm h fitzhugh lee in order to induce the city of baltimore to aid them in building their railroad from staunton to salem the valley railroad company got together a large delegation from the counties through which it was proposed the line should pass and sent it to that city to lay the plans before the mayor and council and request assistance among those selected from rockbridge county was general lee lexington at this time was one of the most inaccessible points in virginia fifty miles of canal or twentythree of staging over a rough mountain road were the only routes in existence the one from lynchburg consumed twelve hours the other from goshen a station on the chesapeake ohio railroad from seven to eleven on one occasion a gentleman during his first visit to lexington called on general lee and on bidding him goodbye asked him the best way to get back to washington it makes but little difference replied the general for whichever route you select you will wish you had taken the other it was therefore the desire of all interested in the welfare of the two institutions of learning located in lexington that this road should be built my fathers previous habits of life his nature and his tastes made him averse to engaging in affairs of this character but because of the great advantage tot he college should it be carried through and a the earnest request of many friends of his and of the road he consented to act general john echols from staunton colonel pendleton from buchanan judge mclaughlin from lexington were amongst those who went with him while in baltimore he stayed at the house of mr and mrs samuel tagart whom he had met several summers at the white sulphur springs the delegation was invited to the floor of the corn and flour exchange to meet the business men of the city my father for the same reasons given above earnestly desired to be excused from this part of the programme and asked some of his friends to see mr john w garrett the president of the baltimore ohio railroad who had the delegation in charge and try to have it so arranged mr garrett however was very positive general lee is a most interesting man i think he had better come was the message brought back to him as he appeared on the floor which was filled with a great crowd he was greeted with deafening cheers and was soon surrounded by the thousands who had assembled there to see him everywhere that he appeared in the city he received an ovation sunday intervening he attended services in the morning at st pauls church on charles street when it became known that general lee was there large numbers collected to see him come out waiting patiently and quietly until the congregation was dismissed as he appeared at the door all heads were uncovered and kept so until he had passed through the long lines extending down the street a reception was given by mr tagart in his honour there his friends crowded to see him and the greatest affection and deference were shown him he had lived in baltimore about twenty years before this time and many of his old friends were still there besides baltimore had sent to the army of northern virginia a large body of her noble sons who were only too glad to greet once more their former commander that he was still a prisoner on parole disfranchised from all civil rights made their love for him stronger and their welcome the more hearty on his return to lexington he was asked how he enjoyed his visit with a sad smile he said very much but they would make too much fuss over the old rebel a few days after he came home when one of his daughters remonstrated with him about the hat he was wearing he replied you dont like this hat why i have seen a whole cityful come out to admire it there is only a short note to my mother that i can find written during this trip baltimore april 27 1869 my dear mary i am still at mr tagarts but propose going tomorrow to ellas and thence to washingtons which will consume wednesday and thursday if not obliged to return here which i cannot tell till this evening or tomorrow morning i will then go to washington where i shall be obliged to spend a day or two and thence to alexandria so i shall not be able to return to lexington till the last of next week what has become of little agnes i have seen many of our old friends of whom i will tell you on my return i have bought you a little carriage the best i could find which i hope will enable you to take some pleasant rides all send love give mine to mildred and custis and all friends i am just about starting to mrs bakers truly and affectionately r e lee mrs m c lee the ella mentioned was mrs sam george of baltimore who as a girl had always been a pet and favourite of my father she was a daughter of his first cousin mr charles henry carter of goodwood prince george county maryland and a schoolmate of my sister mary their country place was near ellicott city he went there to see her and from there to lynwood near by the seat of washington peter my mothers first cousin and an intimate friend of us all on saturday my father accompanied by mr and mrs tagart went to washington on an early train they drove immediately to the executive mansion and called on the president this meeting was of no political significance whatever but simply a call of courtesy it had been intimated to general lee that it would be most agreeable to general grant to receive him mr and mrs tagart went with him and they met there mr motley the newly appointed minister of england the interview lasted about fifteen minutes and neither general lee nor the president spoke a word on political matters while in washington my father was the guest of mrs kennon of tudor place georgetown heights on sunday he dined with mrs podestad and her husband the secretary of the spanish legation who were old friends and relatives after leaving washington he stopped in alexandria for several days as the guest of mrs a m fitzhugh it was at her country place ravensworth about ten miles from town that his mother had died and there in the old ivycovered graveyard she was buried mrs fitzhugh was the wife of my mothers uncle mr william henry fitzhugh who having no children had made my mother his heir the intimacy between arlington and ravensworth was very close since mr fitzhughs death which occurred some thirty years prior to this time my father and mother and their children had been thrown a great deal with his widow and aunt maria as we called her became almost a member of the family she had the greatest love and admiration for robert sought his advice in the management of her estate and trusted him implicitly his brother admiral sidney smith lee came up from richland his home on the potomac near acquia creek to meet him and he found at mrs fitzhughs aunt nannie mrs s s lee and her son fitz lee this was the first time they had met each other since their parting in richmond just after the war on his arrival in alexandria my father had walked up from the wharf to aunt marias he was recognised by a number of citizens who showed him the greatest deference and respect so many of his friends called upon him at mrs fitzhughs that it was arranged to have a reception for him at the mansion house for three hours a constant stream of visitors poured into the parlours the reception was the greatest ovation that any individual had received from the people of alexandria since the days of washington the next day in bishop johns carriage he drove out to seminary hill to the home of mr cassius f lee his first cousin where he spent the night in the afternoon he went to see the bishop and his familygeneral cooper and the reverend dr packard the next morning with uncle smith he attended ascensionday services at christ church and was afterward entertained at a dinnerparty given by mr john b daingerfield before he left alexandria he called on mr john janney who was president of the virginia convention in 1861 when as colonel lee he appeared before it and accepted the command of the virginia forces organised and to be organised one evening a correspondent of the new york herald paid him a visit for the purpose of securing an interview the general was courteous and polite but very firm he stood during the interview and finally dismissed the reporter saying i shall be glad to see you as a friend but request that the visit may not be made in your professional capacity the same correspondent had tried to interview him for his paper while he was in baltimore but had failed my father was much amused at an occurance that took place during this visit late one afternoon a visitor was announced as the general was very tired uncle smith lee volunteered to relieve him the visitor was found to be an irishwoman very stout and unprepossessing who asked if she could see the general the admiral bowed intimating that he was the desired person when she said my boy was with you in the war honey and i must kiss you for his sake and with that she gave the admiral an embrace and a kiss mr cassius lee to whom he told this suggested that he should take general fitz lee along to put forward in such emergencies my fathers

could have visited you and rob and have seen my daughter and grandson but that pleasure i trust is preserved for a future day how is the little fellow i was much relieved after parting from you to hear from the doctors that it was the best time for him to have the whoopingcough in which opinion the mim concurs i hope that he is doing well bishop whittle will be here friday next and is invited

examinations were commencing his new home was about ready to move into and the preparations for the commencement exercises had to be made yet he accepted the trust imposed upon him by his church and took a week out of his valuable time to perform it in his next letter to his son after writing on some smiths island business he tells him of his proposed journey to fredericksburg and of his regret at not being able to visit him as he had intended lexington virginia may 22 1869 my dear fitzhugh the weather here has been very hard on the cornfields and i hear of many having to be replanted the

whoopingcough you must kiss him and his mother for me we are all about the same your mother is becoming interested in her painting again and is employing her brush for the benefit of our little church which is very poor she yet awhile confines herself to coloring photographs and principally to those of general and mrs washington which are sold very readily the girls are well and have miss peyton

to see her all unite with me in affectionate love i am truly your father r e lee these photographs that were being coloured by my mother were from the original portraits of general washington by peale and of mrs washington by w these paintings hung at mt vernon until the death of mrs washington and were then inherited by my grandfather mr custis they were at arlington till 61 when they were removed to ravensworth where they remained until the end of the war when they were being sent to lexington the boat carrying them on the canal between lynchburg and lexington sank these pictures with many others belonging to my mother were very much injured and had to be sent to a restorer in baltimore who made them as good as ever and they were finally safely hung in the presidents house in lexington and are now in the library of the university my mother coloured the photographs of these originals and sold a great many on account of their association rather than their merit there must have been some change of date in my fathers plans for though he said he would start on june 1st for fredericksburg his first and only letter from there was written on may 28th fredericksburg may 28 1869 my dear mary i reached here tuesday night the night after the morning i left you about twelve oclock and found major barton at the depot who conducted me to his house the town seems very full of strangers and

white sulphur springsdeath of professor preston on my fathers return to lexington the new house was ready it adjoined the one he had been occupying so the distance was not great and the transfer was easily accomplished it was much larger and more comfortable than the one given up my mothers room was on the first floor and opened out on the veranda extending three sides of the house where she could she could be rolled in her chair this she enjoyed intensely for she was very fond of the open air and one could see her there every bright day with mrs ruffner a much petted cat sitting on her shoulder or cradled in her lap my fathers favourite seat was in a deep window of the diningroom from which his eyes could rest on rolling fields of grass and grain bounded by the everchanging mountains after his early and simple dinner he usually took a nap of a few minutes sitting upright in his chair his hand held and rubbed by one of his daughters there was a new stable warm and sunny for traveller and his companion lucy long a cowhouse woodshed garden and yard all planned laid out and built by my father the increased room enabled him to invite a great number to visit him and this summer the house was full in answer to a letter from me on business which reached him during commencement week he writes lexington viriginia june 19 1869 my dear son i have just receive your letter of the 10th and have only time for a word i hope all things are going well with you both with the improvement of your farm proceeds will increase and with experience judgment and economy will augment

your father r e lee robert e lee jr ten days later he writes to his son fitzhugh giving up his proposed visit to him at this time expressing his regrets at the necessity and telling his reasons for so doing lexington viriginia june 30 1869 my dear fitzhugh this is the day that i had proposed to visit you but i find it impossible to get away i find a great deal to do in closing up the past session and in preparing for the new in addition our college officers have all been changedproctor clerk treasurer librarianand the new incumbents enter upon their duties tomorrow i shall have to be with them some days to initiate and install them that would only delay me but then on the 15th proximo the educational association of virginia will meet here and i should not be able to return in time as i have never attended any of their meetings when elsewhere if i were to go away when appointed here it would look as if i wished to avoid them which is not the case after that is over i must locate your poor mother at the baths rockbridge baths which she has made up her mind to visit and prepare to go myself to the white sulphur the waters of which i want to drink for three or four weeks so i do not see how i could get to the pamunkey before fall i want to get there very much to see you all and as far as my personal predilections are concerned would rather go there than to the white but the doctors think it would not be so beneficial to me and i am obliged now to consider my health i propose therefore that you bring tabb and the baby up to the mountains and leave them either at the baths with the mim or with me if you cannot remain tell rob if he can he must also come and see us if he were here now he would find very pleasant company misses jones albert kirkland burwell fairfax and wickham all in the house with others out of it they are so much engaged with the collegiates that custis and i see but little of them but he could compete with the yearlings which we cannot tell my daughter

lee general william h fitzhugh lee in a letter dated lexington viriginia july 9th he gives a further account of his plans for the summer i have delivered your letter to mildred who has just returned

participated in three i am sorry to tell you that i cannot go down to the pamunkey this summer as i had intended i had hoped to be able after the conclusion of the commencement exercises of washington college to visit the pamunkey and to return by the 15th inst so as to be present at the convention of the teachers of virginia which assembles here on that day but i was detained here so long that i found i would be unable to accomplish what i desired custis who was to have accompanied me will go down in a day or two about the 20th of this month i shall go to the rockbridge baths with mrs lee who wishes to try the waters again and after seeing her comfortably located if nothing prevents i shall go with mildred and agnes to the white sulphur for a few weeks it is delightfully quiet here now both institutions have closed and all are off enjoying their holiday i should like to remain if i could colonels shipp and harding have gone to get married report says colonel lyle and captain henderson it is said will not return captain preston having been appointed professor at william and mary we shall necessarily lose him but colonel allen will be back and all the rest we are as well as

and which he was enjoying when he wrote did not long remain his he had just gotten my mother comfortably settled at the baths when he received the news of the sudden death of his brother smith he went at once to alexandria hoping to be in time for the burial from there he writes my mother alexandria july 25 1869 my dear mary i arrived here last evening too late to attend the burial of my dear brother an account of which i have clipped from the alexandria gazette and inclose to you i wish you would preserve it fitz and mary went up to ravensworth the evening of the funeral services friday 23d so that i have not seen them but my nephew smith is here and from him i have learned all particulars the attack of his father was short and his death apparently unexpected until a short time before it occurred mary general lees eldest daughter was present and i hope of some comfort to her uncle and assistance to her aunt fitz came here the afternoon of his fathers death thursday 22d made all arrangements for the funeral went out to ravensworth to announce the intelligence to our aunt he carried down friday morning on the steamer mrs cooper and jennie to stay with his mother and returned that afternoon with his fathers remains which were committed to earth as you will see described john returned the next morning yesterday in the mailboat to his mother with whom dan stayed robert arrived this morning and has gone to ravensworth to announce my arrival i shall remain here until i see or hear from fitz for as you will see by the gazettes account the last restingplace of the body has not been determined upon fitz i understand wishes it interred at hollywood richmond nannie a the cemetery here where her father mother and daughter are buried and mrs fitzhugh at ravensworth i think nannies wishes should be consulted i shall probably leave today or tomorrow and after seeing all that remains to us of our dear brother deposited in its last earthly home and mingling my sorrow for a brief season with that of his dear wife and children i shall return to you please send the letter after perusal to agnes and mildred as i shall be unable to write to them i am staying at the mansion house our aunt maria did not come down to the funeral services prevented i fear by her rheumatic attack may god bless us all and preserve us for the time when we too must part the one from the other which is now close at hand and may we all meet again at the footstool of our merciful god to be joined by his eternal love never more to separate most truly and affectionately r e lee mrs m c lee the loss of his brother was a great sorrow to him they were devoted to each other having always kept warm their boyish love smiths admiration for and trust in my father were unbounded and it was delightful to see them together and listen to the stories of the happy long ago they would tell about each other no one could be near my uncle smith without feeling his joyful influence my sister mary who knew him long and well and who was much attached to him thus writes no one who ever saw him can forget his beautiful face charming personality and grace of manner which joined to a nobility of character and goodness of heart attracted all who came in contact with him and made him the most generally beloved and popular of men this was especially so with women to whom his conduct was that of a preux chevalier the most chivalric and courteous and having no daughters of his own he turned with the tenderest affection to the daughters of his brother robert after all the arrangements connected with this sad event had been completed my father went up to ravensworth to see aunt maria who had always been a second mother to his brother there amid the cool shades of this lovely old home he rested for a day or two from the fatigues of travel and the intense heat during this visit as he passed the room in which his mother had died he lingered near the door and said to one present forty years ago i stood in this room by my mothers deathbed it seems now but yesterday while here he determined to go back to lexington via richmond and to run down thence to the white house to see his grandson he arrived there on friday july 30th on sunday he wrote to my mother white house new kent august 1 1869 my dear mary i arrived here on friday last and found them all well our daughter tabb has not been altogether well and shows its effects her baby i think would also be improved by mountain air i have therefore persuaded her to accompany me and join you at the baths we shall leave richmond if nothing prevents on tuesday morning 3d inst and hope to reach the baths that evening in the stage from goshen i have written to mr peyton requesting him to prepare a good room for tabb and her little family as near you as convenient and trust we may reach there in health and comfort at the time appointed i hope i shall find you well and comfortable and markie in the enjoyment of every good how are the poor little children my previous letters will have informed you of everything important i will supply all omissions when i see you custis is here much improved i

friend mr dallam and went down thursday he was very well custis arrived saturday week mr kepler is here and will preach at st peters this morning i hope to attend mr kepler says his health is much improved fitzhugh doses him with cholagogue goodbye affectionately yours r e lee st peters was the old colonial church a few miles away in which general washington and mrs custis were married about one hundred years prior to this time mr kepler the pastor preached there twice a month he lived in richmond and to keep him free from feverandague my brother dosed him freely with cholagogue whenever he came down into the malarial country i came up from romancoke sunday morning arriving in time to be present at the christening of my nephew which ceremony was decided on rather hurriedly in order that the grandfather might stand as godfather after returning from the morning service at st peters where we all went it was decided that the mother and child should go to the mountains with my father as there were some preparations for the summer to be made his daughter and her baby went to petersburg that afternoon agreeing to meet the general in richmond monday night and start for the rockbridge baths tuesday morning on monday he writes to a friend with whom he had intended to stop for a day on his way back to lexington white house new kent county august 1 1869 i had promised myself the pleasure of seeing you on my way to lexington of spending with you one short day to cheer and refresh me but i shall travel up in a capacity that i have not undertaken for many yearsas escort to a young mother and her infant and it will require the concentration of all my faculties to perform my duties even with tolerable comfort to my charge i go up with my daughter i may say this time too my youngest daughter his daughterinlaw mrs w h f lee to place her with her mama at the rockbridge baths the waters of which i hope will invigorate both mother and child who have been wearied and weakened by the long attack of whoopingcough from which the latter has suffered i came down from richmond to spend sunday and was fortunate enough to find here my three sons but i am sorry to say but one daughter most truly yours r e lee monday night was spent in richmond it was soon known that general lee was at the exchange hotel and great numbers came to call upon him so that he was compelled to hold an informal reception in the large parlours the next day with his new daughter and her baby he started for the baths where they arrived safely the same night then he proceeded to carry out his original plan for the summer and went with his two daughters to the white sulphur springs from there he writes to his wife white sulphur springs greenbrier county west virginia august 10 1869 my dear mary i received this morning your addenda to annie wickhams letter inclosing custiss i also received by same mail a letter from mr richardson reiterating his request to insert my portrait in my fathers memoirs saying that it was by the desire of many mutual friends on the ground of its giving additional interest to the work and increasing its sale that may or may not be so at any rate i differ from them besides there is no good portrait accessible to him and the engraving in the lee family i think would be an injury to any book his recent proposition of inserting my portrait where the family history is given takes from it a part of my obligation and if it were believed that such an addition would add to the interest of the book i should assent i have so told him and that i would write to you for your suggestions and to ask whether you could send him a portrait worth inserting what do you think there is to be a grand concert her tonight for the benefit of our church in lexington it is gotten up by miss mary jones and other kind people here and the proposition is so favourably received that i hope a handsome sum will be realised the girls are well i do not know how long they will continue so they seem to be footfree a great many visitors were turned off last nightno room for them a grand ball in honour of mr peabody is to come off tomorrow after which it is supposed there will be more breathingspace i have seen mr and mrs charles ridgely of hampton since i wrote also numerous other acquaintances i should prefer more quiet how is my daughter tabb mother and son are improving i trust i hope you and markie are also doing well no change in myself as yet the girls would send love if i could find them affectionately yours mrs r e lee r e lee a few days later he writes white sulphur springs august 14 1869 my dear mary i received last night your letter of the 13thvery prompt deliveryand ma very glad to learn of the welldoing of all with you i am particularly pleased to hear that our daughter and grandson are improving and should you find them not benefiting i wish you would urge them to try some other springs for i have it greatly to heart that they should receive all possible advantage from their summer trip i hope markie will be benefited by the red sweet the water is considered a great tonic but i fear none will be warm enough for her but the hot if i cannot get over to see her i will notify her of our departure from here which will be in about two weeks i have received a letter from fitz lee saying that mary would leave richlands last tuesday 10th inst for ravensworth which i presume she did as his letter was postmarked that day at acquia creek and was probably mailed by him or one of the boys on putting her aboard the mailboat you will be glad to learn that the proceeds of the concert for our church at lexington netted 605 which has been subsequently increased to 805 by messrs corcoran and peabody with a donation of 100 from each for all of this i am extremely grateful as regards the portrait for mr richardson you must do as you please i shall not write to him any more on the subject unless the portrait is good and pleasing i think it will be an injury to the book i have had a visit since commencing this letter from a mr william bath of new orleans who showed me a wreath made in part she says of my your and mildreds hair sent her by you more than two years ago she says she sent you a similar one at the time but of this i could tell her nothing for i recollect nothing about it she says her necessities now compel her to put her wreath up to raffle and she desired to know whether i had any objection to her scheme and whether i would head the list all this as you may imagine is extremely agreeable to me but i had to decline her offer of taking a chance in her raffle miss mary jones has gone to the sweet tell miss belle i wish she were coming here i shall be glad to see mrs caskie mildred has her picture the girls are always busy at something but never ready the stuarts have arrived mrs julia is improving perceptibly love to all r e lee the markie referred to in each of the above letters was martha custis williams a greatniece of my grandfather mr custis who had for many years lived at arlington with her uncle the little children were her motherless nieces whom she had brought that summer to the mountains for their health general lee had been engaged for some time in bringing out a third edition of his fathers memoirs of the war of 76 in the southern states it was now in the hands of his publisher mr richardson of new york to this edition he had added a sketch of the famous light horse harry written by himself it was to his publishers proposition of placing his portrait in the introduction to the new work that he at first objected and then agreed as stated in the two letters just given the season of 69 is still noted in the annals of the white sulphur as having had in its unusually large company so many noted and distinguished men mr george peabody and mr w w corcoran the two great philanthropists were among them and helped to enlarge the receipts of the concert for the benefit of the little episcopal church in lexington of which general lee was a member and a vestryman by the last of august he was back again in lexington making arrangements for the homecoming of his wife and her party from the baths here is part of another letter written soon after his arrival home some lines of which apparently relating to the servants have been partially obliterated by time lexington virginia august 31 1869 my dear mary i received this evening your note by miss mays you had better come up whenever agreeable to your partywe can only try them and make the best of them alice when she gets well will return if wanted if cousin julia mrs richard stuart of cedar grove will return with you you can see her here as well as there and we can all have that pleasure if she will not you had better remain with her as long as she will stay mrs pratt died today at 1230 p m i received a letter today from edward childe saying that he and blanche would leave liverpool in the fava on september 4th and after spending a few days in the north would come to lexington he will probably reach boston about september 15th so that they may be expected here from the 20th to the 30th of september i am anxious for them to see our daughter and grandson and all our sons give my best love to all with you the girls would send love but a yearling and a leader of the herd yearling was a term that originated with us just after the war when many of the students were exsoldiers to distinguish the real boys from the confeds from that expression a professor came to be called a leader of the herd it was a form of speech that we had kept up amongst ourselves occupy them affectionately yours r e lee mrs m c lee this session of washington college opened with very favourable prospects the number of students was larger than ever before every southern and some northern states being represented the new chairs of instruction which had been instituted were now in good working order their professors were comfortably established and the entire machinery of the institution was running well and smoothly the president commenced to see some of the results of his untiring energy and steady work he had many plans which lack of funds prevented him from carrying out one of them was a school of commerce in which a student while following the branches which would discipline and cultivate the mind might also receive special instruction and systematic training in whatever pertained to business in the largest sense of the term another was a school of medicine the plan for which with full details was drawn up under his eye and kept in readiness until the funds of the institution should permit of its being carried into effect his meeting with mr peabody at the white sulphur springs attracted that gentlemans attention to the college and to his work as its president to a request for his photograph to be placed in the peabody institute among the friends of its founder he sends with the likeness the following note washington college virginia september 25 1869 f poole secretary peabody institute peabody massachusetts dear sir in compliance with your request i send a photograph of myself the last that has been taken and shall fell honoured in its being placed among the friends of mr peabody for though they can be numbered by millions yet all can appreciate the man who was illustrated his age by his munificent charities during his life and by his wise provisions for promoting the happiness of his fellowcreatures very respectfully your obedient servant r e lee my fathers family was now comfortably established in their new home and had the usual number of friends visiting them this autumn in due time edward childe blanche and duckie their little dog arrived and remained for a week or two the lastnamed member of the party was of great interest he was very minute very helpless and received more attention than the average baby he had crossed the atlantic in fear and trembling and did not apparently enjoy the new world his utter helplessness and the great care taken of him by his mistress his illhealth and the unutterable woe of his countenance greatly excited my fathers pity after he went away he often spoke of him and referred to him i find in one of his letters during this trip to america edward and his wife carrying the wretched duckie with them paid their visit to the white house this autumn the little carriage my father mentioned having purchased for my mother in baltimore was put into use he frequently drove out in it with my mother his new daughter and grandson lucy long under his guidance carefully carried them over the beautiful hills around lexington one afternoon while paying a visit with his daughter tabb to colonel william preston johnston who lived two miles down the river in pulling up a steep ascent to the front door lucy fell choked into unconsciousness by too tight a collar my father jumped out hastily got off the harness and on perceiving the cause of the accident reproached himself vehemently for his carelessness and thoughtlessness he was very much distressed at this accident petted his mare saying to her in soothing tones that he was ashamed of himself for having caused her all this pain after she had been so faithful to him his rides on traveller in which he delighted so much were not so frequent now he was not so strong as he had been through the spring and summer and indeed during november he had a very severe attack of cold from which he did not recover for several weeks however during the beautiful days of october he was often seen out in the afternoons on his old gray his favourite route was the road leading to the rockbridge baths a year previous to this time he would sometimes go as far as the baths and return in an afternoon a trip of twenty miles a part of this road led through a dense forest one afternoon as he told the story himself he met a plain old soldier in the midst of these woods who recognising the general reined in his horse and said general lee i am powerful glad to see you and i feel like cheering you the general replied that this would not do as they were all alone only two of them and there would be no object whatever in cheering but the old soldier insisted that he must and waving his hat about his head cried out hurrah for general lee and kept repeating it as the general rode away he continued to hear the cheers until he was out of sight on another afternoon as professors white and nelson taking a horseback ride approached the summit of a long hill they heard behind them the sound of a horses feet running rapidly in a few moments general lee appeared on traveller at full speed on joining his friends he reined up and said i thought a little run would be good for traveller he often gave his horse a breather as he called it the animal was so strong and powerful that he chafed at restraint and unless ridden regularly and hard had a very disagreeable fretful trot after a good gallop up one of the long rockbridge hills he would proceed at a quiet walk the tenderness in my fathers heart for children i have already often remarked upon one afternoon two little girls the daughters of two of his professors were riding on a gentle old horse up and down one of the back streets of the town fearing to go too far from home the general starting out on his afternoon ride came up with them and knowing them well said gaily come with me little girls and i will show you a beautiful ride only too delighted they consented to go he took them out beyond the fairgrounds from which point there is one of the grandest stretches of mountain scenery in the world one of the little maidens had her face tied up as she was just recovering from the mumps he pretended that he was much alarmed lest his horse should catch them from her and kept saying i hope you wont give traveller the mumps and what shall i do if traveller gets the mumps an hour later this party was seen returning the two little girls in sunbonnets on the one old sleepy horse and general lee by their side on traveller who was stepping very proudly as if in scorn of his lowly companion my father took the children to their homes helped them dismount took a kiss from each and waving a parting salute rode away it was such simple acts of kindness and consideration that made all children confide in him and love him soon after the attack of cold mentioned above he writes to his son fitzhugh then at the white house with his family lexington virginia december 2 1869 my dear fitzhugh your letters to custis told us of your welldoing i want to see you all very much and think the sight of my daughter and grandson would do me good i have had a wretched cold the effects of which have not left me but i am better the doctors still have me in hand but i fear can do no good the present mild weather i hope will be beneficial enabling me to ride and be in the open air but travellers trot is harder to me than it used to be and fatigues me we are all as usualthe women of the family very fierce and the men very mild custis has been a little unwell but is well regulated by his sisters neither gaiety nor extravagance prevails amongst us and the town is quiet our community has been greatly grieved at the death of mr frank preston to whom i was much attached and for whom i had a high esteem give my love to bertus tell him i hope mrs taylor will retain one of her little daughters for him she always reserves the youngest of the flock from custis as he is not particular as to an early date your affectionate father r e lee general william h f lee frank preston at the time of his death was professor of greek at william and mary college he had been prior to his appointment to that position an assistant professor at washington college he was a native of lexington a son of colonel thomas l preston who was for so long a time professor at the virginia military institute a brilliant scholar trained in the best german universities and a gentleman in the highest sense of the word frank had served his state in the late war and had left an arm on the heights of winchester on hearing of his death president lee issued the following announcement washington college november 23 1869 the death of professor frank preston a distinguished graduate and late associate professor of greek in this college has caused the deepest sorrow in the hearts of the institution endowed with a mind of rare capacity which had been enriched by diligent study and careful cultivation he stood among the first in the state in his pursuit in life we who so long and so intimately possessed his acquaintance and so fully enjoyed the privilege of his companionship feel especially his loss and grieve profoundly at his death and we heartily sympathise with his parents and relations in their great affliction and truly participate in the deep sorrow that has befallen them with the view of testifying the esteem felt for his character and the respect due to his memory all academic exercises will be suspended for the day and the faculty and students are requested to attend in their respective bodies his funeral services at the presbyterian church at eleven oclock to pay the last sad tribute of respect to his earthly remains while cherishing in their hearts his many virtues r e lee president the general declines lucrative positions in new york and atlantahe suffers from an obstinate coldlocal gossiphe is advised to go south in the spring of 1870desires to visit his daughter annies grave after general lee had accepted the presidency of washington college he determined to devote himself entirely to the interest and improvement of that institution from this resolution he never wavered an offer that he should be a the head of a large house to represent southern commerce that he should reside in new york and have placed at his disposal an immense sum of money he declined saying i am grateful but i have a selfimposed task which i must accomplish i have led the young men of the south in battle i have seen many of them die on the field i shall devote my remaining energies to training young men to do their duty in life to a request from some of his old officers that he should associate himself with a business enterprise in the south as its president he replied with the following letter lexington virginia december 14 1869 general j b gordon president southern life insurance company atlanta georgia my dear general i have received your letter of the 3d inst and am duly sensible of the kind feelings which prompted your proposal it would be a great pleasure to me to be associated with you hampton b h hill and the other good men whose names i see on your list of directors but i feel that i ought not to abandon the position i hold at washington college at this time or as long as i can be of service to it thanking you for your kind consideration for which i know i am alone indebted for your proposition to become president of the southern life insurance company and with kindest regards to mrs gordon and my best wishes for yourself i am very truly yours r e lee his correspondence shows that many like positions were made to him the christmas of 69 neither my brother nor myself was with him knowing of our plans in that respect he wrote before the holidays to fitzhugh wishing us both the compliments of the season and a pleasant time in the visits we were going to make lexington virginia december 18 1869 my dear fitzhugh i must begin by wishing you a pleasant christmas and many many happy new years and may each succeeding year bring to you and yours increasing happiness i shall think of you and my daughter and my grandson very often during the season when families are generally united and though absent from you in person you will always be present in mind and my poor prayers and best wishes will accompany you all wherever you are bertus will also be remembered and i hope that the festivities of brandon will not drive from his memory the homely board at lexington i trust that he will enjoy himself and find some on to fill that void in his heart as completely as he will the one in hissystem tell tabb that no one in petersburg wants to see her half as much as her papa and now that her little boy has his mouth full of teeth he would not appear so lonesome as he did in the summer if she should find in the burg a duckie to take his place i beg that she will send him up to me i duly received your letter previous to the 12th inst and requested some of the family who were writing about that time to inform you when i last wrote i could not find it on my table and did not refer to it the mim says you excel her in counting if you do not in writing but she does not think she is in your debt i agree with you in your views about smiths island and see no advantage in leasing it but wish you could sell it to advantage i hope the prospects may be better in the spring political affairs will be better i think and people will be more sanguine and hopeful you must be on the alert i wish i could go down to see you but think it better for me to remain here to leave home now and return during the winter would be worse for me it is too cold for your mother to travel now she says she will go down in the spring but you know what an exertion it is for her to leave home and the inconvenience if not the suffering is great the anticipation however is pleasing to her and encourages hope and i like her to enjoy it though am not sanguine that she will realise it mildred is probably with you and can tell you all about us i am somewhat reconciled to her absence by the knowledge of the benefit that she will be to tabb tell the latter that she mildred is modest and backward in giving advice but that she has mines of wealth on that subject and that she tabb must endeavour to extract from her her views on the management of a household children etc and the proper conduct to be observed toward husbands and the world in general i am sure my little son will receive many wise admonitions which he will take openmouthed i have received a letter from your uncle carter telling me of his pleasant visit to you and of his agreeable impressions of his nephew and new niece he was taken very sick in richmond and delayed there so long that he could not be present at wm kennons wedding and missed the festivities at his neighbour gilliams and at norwood indeed he had not recovered his strength when lucy wrote a few days ago and her account makes me very uneasy about him i am glad rob has so agreeable a neighbour as general cooke and i presume it is the north carolina brigadier a virginianson of general st george cooke of the federal army who commanded a north carolina brigade in a p hills corps a n va when you go to petersburg present my kind regards to mr and mrs bolling miss melville and all friends all here unite with me in love to you tabb and the boy in which mildred is included your affectionate father r e lee general william h f lee in a note written the day after acknowledging a paper sent to him to sign he says i wrote to you yesterday saturday in reply to your former letter and stated the reasons why i could not visit you your mother has received mildreds letter announcing her arrival in richmond and will write to her there i can only repeat my love and prayers that every blessing may attend you and yours we are as usual truly and affectionately r e lee general william h f lee the attack of cold from which my father suffered in october had been very severe rapid exercise on horseback or on foot produced pain and difficulty in breathing after he was considered by most of his friends to have gotten well over it it was very evident to his doctors and himself that there was a serious trouble about the heart and he often had great weariness and depression he complained but little was often very bright and cheerful and still kept up his oldtime fun and humour in his conversation and letters but his letters written during this year to his immediate family show that he was constantly in pain and had begun to look upon himself as an invalid to mildred who was in richmond on a visit to friends he writes jokingly about the difficulty experienced by the family in finding out what she meant in a letter to him lexington virginia january 8 1870 my precious life i received you letter of the 4th we held a family council over it it was passed from eager hand to hand and attracted wondering eyes and mysterious looks it produced few words but a deal of thinking and the conclusion arrived at i believe unanimously was that there was a great fund of amusement and information in it if it could be extracted i have therefore determined to put it carefully away till your return seize a leisure day and get you to interpret it your mothers commentary in a suppressed soliloquy was that you had succeeded in writing a wretched hand agnes thought that it would keep this cold weatherher thoughts running on jellies and oysters in the storeroom but i indignant at such aspersions upon your accomplishments retained your epistle and read in an elevated tone an interesting narrative of travels in sundry countries describing gorgeous scenery hairbreadth escapes and a series of remarkable events by flood and field not a word of which they declared was in your letter your return i hope will prove the correctness of my version of your annals i have little to tell gaiety continues last night there was a cadet hop night before a party at colonel johnstons the night preceding a college conversazione at your mothers it was given in honour of miss maggie johnstons visit of a few days to us you know how agreeable i am on such occasions but on this i am told i surpassed myself on new years day the usual receptions many of our friends called many of my ancients as well as juniors were present and all enjoyed some good norfolk oysters i refer you to agnes for details we are pretty well i think i am better your mother and sisters as usual custis busy with the examination of the cadets the students preparing for theirs cadet cook who was so dangerously injured by a fall from his window on the 1st it is hoped now will recover the misses pendleton were to have arrived this morning and miss ella heninberger is on a visit to miss campbell miss lizzie letcher still absent messrs anderson baker w graves moorman strickler and webb have all been on visits to their sweethearts and have left without them mrs smith is as usual gus is as wild as ever mrs smith and gus were the names of two of the pet cats of my sister gus was short for gustavus adolphus we catch our own rats and mice now and are independent of cats all unite in love to you your affectionate father r e lee miss mildred lee a month later he writes again to this daughter in the same playful strain and sends his remembrances to many friends in richmond lexington virginia february 2 1870 my precious life your letter of the 29th ultimo which has been four days on the road reached me this morning and my reply unless our mails whip up will not get to you before sunday or monday there is no danger therefore of our correspondence becoming too brisk what do the young girls do whose lovers are at washington college or the institute their tender hearts must always be in a lacerated and bleeding condition i hope you are not now in that category for i see no pining swains among them whose thoughts and wishes are stretching eagerly toward richmond i am glad you have had so pleasant a visit to the andersons you must present my regards to them all and i hope that misses ellen and mary will come to see you in the summer i am sure you will have an agreeable time at brook hill remember me to all the family and tell miss belle to spare my friend wilkins he is not in a condition to enjoy the sufferings which she imposes on her richmond beaux besides his position entitles him to tender treatment i think it time that you should be thinking of returning home i want to see you very much and as you have been receiving instruction from the learned pig i shall expect to see you much improved we are not reduced to apply to such instructors at lexington here we have learned professors to teach us what we wish to know and the franklin institute to furnish us lectures on science and literature you had better come back if you are in search of information on any subject i am glad that miss nannie wise found one occasion on which her ready tongue failed her she will have to hold it in subjection now i should like to see miss belle under such similar circumstances provided she did not die from suppressed ideas what an awful feeling she must experience if the occasion should ever come for her to restrain that active member although my friend wilkins would be very indulgent i think he would want her to listen sometimes miss pendleton has just been over to give us some pleasing news her niece miss susan meade philips daughter is to be married next month to a mr brown of kentucky who visited her two year ago upon the recommendation of the reverend charles page found her a schoolgirl and has waited until she became a woman he is rich fortynine and has six children there is a fair start in the world for a young woman i recommend her example to you we are all as usual and mrs smith is just the same miss maggie johnston who has been staying with us occasionally for a few days at a time is now on a visit to us there is to be an anniversary celebration of the societies of the institute on friday and a students party on monday night and a dance at the college hotel tomorrow night your mother has an evening for some young students gaiety will never cease in lexington so long as the ladies are so attractive and the men so agreeable surprise parties are the fashion now miss lucy campbell has her cousin miss ella heninberger staying with her who assists her to surprise and capture too unwary youths i am sorry to hear of mrs oulds illness if you see her present me most kindly to her also to mrs george randolph do beware of vanilla cream recollect how far you are from home and do not tamper with yourself our semiannual examination has been in progress for a fortnight we shall conclude on saturday which will be a great relief for me for in addition to other things i have to be six hours daily in the examination rooms i was sorry that i could not attend mr peabodys funeral but i did not feel able to undertake the journey especially at this season i am getting better i hope and feel stronger than i did but i cannot walk much farther than to the college though when i get on my horse i can ride with comfort agnes accompanies me very often i must refer you to her and your mother for all local news give my love to fitzhugh and tabb and robert when you see them and for yourself keep an abundance i have received letters from edward and blanche they are very anxious about the condition of political affairs in france blanche sent you some receipts for creams etc you had better come and try them your affectionate father r e lee miss mildred lee the following letter to his son fitzhugh further shows his tender interest in his children and grandson lexington viriginia february 14 1870 my dear fitzhughi hope that you are all well and that you will not let any one spoil my grandson your mother has written all the family and lexington news she gathers much more than i do i go nowhere but to the college and when the weather permits i ride in the mountains i am better i think but still troubled mildred i hope is with you when she gets away from her papa she does not know what she wants to do tell her you have had a fine winter for work and later you will have a profitable season custis is well and very retired i see no alarming exhibition of attention to the ladies i have great hopes of robert give much love to my daughter tabb and to poor little life i wish i could see you all it would do my pains good poor little agnes is not at all well and i am urging her to go away for a while mary as usual affectionately your father r e lee general w h f lee after waiting all winter for the improvement in his health my father yielding at last to the wishes of his family physician and friends determined to try the effect of a southern climate it was thought it might do him good at any rate to escape the rigours of a lexington march and could do no harm in the following letters to his children he outlines his plans and touchingly alludes to the memory of his daughter annie who died in 1862 and was buried at warrenton springs north carolina lexington virginia march 21 1870 my dear daughter the doctors and others think i had better go to the south in the hope of relieving the effects of the cold under which i have been labouring all the winter i think i should do better here and am very reluctant to leave home in my present condition but they seem so interested in my recovery and so persuasive in their uneasiness that i should appear obstinate if not perverse if i resisted longer i therefore consented to go and will take agnes to savannah as she seems anxious to visit that city or perhaps she will take me i wish also to visit my dear annies grave before i die i have always desired to do so since the cessation of active hostilities but have never been able i wish to see how calmly she sleeps away from us all with her dear hands folded over her breast as if in mute prayer while her pure spirit is traversing the land of the blessed i shall diverge from the main route of travel for this purpose and it will depend somewhat upon my feelings and somewhat upon my procuring an escort for agnes whether i go further south i am sorry not to be able to see you before i go but if i return i hope to find you here well and happy you must take good care of your mother and do everything she wants you must not shorten your trip on account of our departure custis will be with her every day and mary is with her still the servants seem attractive goodbye my dear child remember me to all friends and believe me your affectionate father r e lee miss mildred lee lexington virginia march 22 1870 my dear fitzhugh your letter of the 17th inst has been received lest i should appear obstinate if not perverse i have yielded to the kind importunities of my physicians and of the faculty to take a trip toward the south in pursuance of my resolution i shall leave here thursday next in the packetboat and hope to arrive in richmond on friday afternoon i shall take with me as my companion agnes who has been my kind and uncomplaining nurse and if we could only get down to you that evening we would do so for i want to see you my sweet daughter and dear grandson but as the doctors think it important that i should reach a southern climate as soon as practicable i fear i shall have to leave my visit to you till my return i shall go first to warrenton springs north carolina to visit the grave of my dear annie where i have always promised myself to go and i think if i accomplish it i have no time to lose i wish to witness her quiet sleep with her dear hands crossed over her breast as if it were in mute prayer undisturbed by her distance from us and to feel that her pure spirit is waiting in bliss in the land of the blessed from there according to my feelings i shall either go down to norfolk or to savannah and take you if practicable on my return i would ask you to come up to richmond but my movements are unknown to myself as i cannot know the routes schedules etc till i arrive there but i have promised not to linger there longer than necessary so i must avoid temptation we are all as usual your mother still talks of visiting you and when i urge her to make preparations for the journey she replies rather disdainfully she has none to make they have been made years ago custis and mary are well and mildred writes that she will be back by april 1st we are having beautiful weather now which i hope may continue from your affectionate father r e lee to his daughter mildred he writes again giving her the minutest details as to the routes home this is very characteristic of him we were always fully instructed all the roads of life were carefully marked out for us by him lexington virginia march 23 1870 my dear daughter i wrote to you the other day telling you of my intention of going south and of my general plan as far as formed this morning your letter of the 21st arrived i hope you will get back comfortably and safely and if you can fall in with no escort you had better go as far as alexandria the first stage of your journey aunt maria cassius lee the smiths etc would receive you if you wish to come by goshen you must take the train from alexandria on tuesday thursday or saturday so as to arrive here about twelve oclock at night by taking the train from alexandria on the alternate days monday wednesday or friday you will reach staunton that evening by four p m remain all night and come over by daylight the following day in the stage by taking the train from alexandria to lynchburg mondays wednesdays or fridays you will reach there the same afternoon about four p m then go immediately to the packetboat and you will arrive here next morning this last is the easiest route and the best if you find no escort tell all the conductors and captains that you are my runaway daughter and they will take care of you i leave tomorrow evening on the packetboat i told you that agnes would accompany me tell my cousins washington jane and mary that i wish i were going to see them i should then anticipate some pleasure but the doctors say i must turn my face the other way i know they do not know everything and yet i have often had to do what i was told without benefit to myself and i shall have to do it again goodbye my dear daughter all unite in love your affectionate father r e lee miss mildred lee letters to mrs lee from richmond and savannahfrom brandonagnes lees account of her fathers greetings from old friends and old soldierswilmington and norfolk do him honourvisits to fitzhugh and robert in their homes it is to be regretted that so little was written by my father while on this trip in the letters extant he scarcely refers to his reception by the people at different points visited his daughter agnes tells more and we can imagine how tenderly and joyfully he was greeted by his old soldiers their wives children and friends he was very unwilling to be made a hero anywhere and most reluctant to show himself to the crowds assembled at every station along his route pressing to catch sight of him why should they care to see me he would say when urged to appear on the platform of the train i am only a poor old confederate this feeling natural to him was probably intensified at that time by the state of his health on sunday he writes to my mother of his trip to richmond and of his stay there richmond virginia march 29 1870 my dear mary i reached here friday afternoon and had a more comfortable journey than i expected the night aboard the packet was very trying but i survived it and the dust of the railroad the following day yesterday the doctors huston mccaw and cunningham examined me for two hours and i believe contemplate returning today they say they will make up their opinion and communicate it to doctor barton who will write me what to do in the meantime they desire me to continue his prescriptions i think i feel better than when i left lexington certainly stronger but am a little feverish whether it is produced by the journey or the toddies that agnes administers i do not know i have not been able to see anybody nor was i able to get the groceries yesterday agnes thinks you will have enough to last till i get back here when i will select them and send them up should you want any particular article write to messrs bacon lewis for it i saw yesterday morning mr john stewart and miss mary miss mary stewart of brook hill afterward mrs thomas pinckney of south carolina who had called to see agnes but found she was out miss mary looked very sweet and inquired about you all agnes rode out there yesterday afternoon and saw all the family i am told all our friends here are well many of my northern friends have done me the honour to call on me among them brick pomeroy the like to see all that is going on agnes has gone to church with colonel corley i was afraid to go the day is unfavourable and i should see so many of my old friends to whom i would like to speak that it might be injurious to me i was in hopes that fitzhugh might make his appearance yesterday when we should have learned all about those below but he did not i hear that they are all well however i expect to continue our journey tomorrow if nothing prevents though i have not yet got the information i desire about the routes still i will get on i will leave to agnes to tell about herself love to all truly r e lee the next letter that i find is written from savannah savannah georgia april 2 1870 my dear mary i reached here yesterday evening and have borne the journey much better than i expected i think i am stronger than when i left lexington but otherwise can discover no difference i have had a tedious journey upon the whole and have more than ever regretted that i undertook it however i have enjoyed meeting many friends and the old soldiers have greeted me very cordially my visit to dear annies grave was mournful yet soothing to my feelings and i was glad to have the opportunity of thanking the kind friends for their care of her while living and their attention to her since her death i saw most of the ladies of the committee who undertook the preparation of the monument and the inclosure of the cemetery and was very kindly received by all the citizens of warrenton and indeed at all the towns through which we passed yesterday several gentlemen from savannah met the train in which we came from augustageneral lawton mr andrew lowe mr hodgson etc etc i found they had arranged among themselves about my sojourn so i yielded at once and after depositing agnes at general lawtons i came off to mr lowes where i am now domiciled his house is partially dismantled and he is keeping house alone so i have a very quiet time this morning i took a short drive around the city with agnes and miss lawton and on returning called on mrs elliot who has her two widowed daughters living with mrs elliot and mrs habersham i also went to see mrs gordon mrs gilmer and mrs owen and then returned to the lowes where i find he has invited some gentlemen to meet me at dinnergeneral joe johnston general lawton general gilmer colonel corley etc colonel corley has stuck to me all the journey and now talks of going to new orleans the weather today is rather cool and raw with an easterly wind and if it continues i will go on to florida next week the woods are filled with flowers yellow jasmine covering all the trees etc and fresh vegetables everywhere i must leave agnes to give you all the details the writingdesk is placed in a dark corner in this handsome house prepared for younger eyes than mine and i can hardly see what i write all friends inquire after you custis mary and mildred give my love to all and believe me most truly r e lee mrs r e lee the colonel corley mentioned in the above letters had been on general lees staff as chief quartermaster from the time he assumed command of the army of northern virginia until the surrender his voluntary service as escort on this trip so delicately offered and performed was highly appreciated by his old commander a letter from his daughter to her mother written the next day tells many particulars of their journey but still leaves much to be desired savannah georgia april 3 1870 i hardly know where to commence i have so little time to write we left richmond monday 2 p m we reached warrenton at ten oclock and were taken to their house by mr and mrs white who met us at the depot the next morning papa and i drove with captain whites horses to the cemetery mrs white gave me a quantity of beautiful white hyacinths which she said were for you too and i had brought some grey moss that kitty stiles had given me this i twined on the base of the monument the flowers looked very pure and beautiful the place is just as it is in mr hopes picture which i have it was a great satisfaction to be there again we did not go to the springs a mile off returning we stopped at mr joe joness old mr js son they insisted on our taking dinner he has eleven children i think and there were numberless others there they loaded me with flowers the garden full of hyacinths and early spring flowers mrs jones is a very nice lady one of those who were foremost in erecting the monument we then stopped at the farm of the joness who were at the springs when we were there in the autumn of 1862 and mrs j knew me at once and asked affectionately after you saw patty and emmaall the daughters married except patty and the youngest mr j is very infirmeightythree years old that evening a number of persons came to see us mrs alston and miss brownlow two others of the committee of ladies every one was very kind indeed i wish you could travel with papa to see the affection and feeling shown toward him everywhere we spent that night in the sleepingcar very handsome and comfortable but the novelty i suppose made us wakeful at raleigh and another place the people crowded to the depot and called lee lee and cheered vociferously but we were locked up and mum everywhere along the road where meals were provided the landlords invited us in and when we would not get out sent coffee and lunches even soldiers on the train sent in fruit and i think we were expected to die of eating at charlotte and salisbury there were other crowds and bands colonel corley joined us at c having asked to go to savannah with us the train stopped fifteen minutes at columbia colonel alexander haskell took charge of the crowd which in spite of the pouring rain stood there till we left general e porter alexander was there and was very hearty in his inquiries after all of us his little girl was lifted into the car namesakes appeared on the way of all sizes old ladies stretched their heads into the windows at waystations and then drew back and said he is mightily like his pictures we reached augusta wednesday night the mayor and council met us having heard a few minutes before that papa was on the train we were whirled off to the hotel and papa decided to spend thursday there they had a reception the whole of the morning crowds came wounded soldiers servants and workingmen even the sweetest little childrennamesakesdressed to their eyes with bouquets of japonicaor tiny cards in their little fat handswith their names robert burwell of clarke who married miss clayton there randall author of my maryland general mclaws wright gardner and many others saw the misses boggs general bs sisters miss rebecca knew mrs kirkpatrick very well and asked after her miss russell with whose father and sisters we had been at the white sulphur helped us to receive she is very tall and handsome and was superb in a white lace shawl a moireantique with a train the branch brothers rather took possession of me melville who was at the institute virginia military institute lexington virginia and knew the letchers very well drove me in and around townat the rate of a mile a minute another brother took me to the skating rink at nighta serenade that night at some point on the way here generals lawton and gilmer mr andrew lowe and others got on the cars with us flowers were given us at various places i so much enjoyed the evidences of spring all along our routemore and more advanced as we proceeded the jasmine though passing away was still in sufficient abundance in some places to perfume the air the dark marshes were rich in tall magnolia trees beautiful red buds and other red blossoms i did not know the jasmine and the trees hanging with gray mossperfectly weirdlookinghave been the least luxuriant places in the interim savannah is green with liveoaksand filled with trees and shrubbery i wish you could see a large marble table in the parlour where i am writing with a pyramid of jasmine in the centre and four large plates full at the corners almost covering the square all sent me saturday the lawtons are as kind as possible wanted papa to stay here but mr andrew lowe had arranged to take him to his house at bedtime so he lost the benefit of a serenade from two bands alternating which we enjoyedgeneral lawton telling the crowd general lee had retired from fatigue papa has borne the journey and the crowds far better than i thought he would and seems stronger monday it seems impossible to finish thisi inclose some scraps which will tell our story crowds of persons have been coming to see me ever since i came saw mrs general johnstonnannie hutchensonof course and reverend and mrs moore yesterday they left today colonel corley has taken corinne corinne lawton and me on a beautiful drive this morning to bonaventure which is to be a cemetery and to several places in its vicinity i never saw anything more impressive and beautiful than the avenues of liveoaks literally covered with long gray moss arching over the roads tell messrs owen and minis i have seen their families who are very kind to us general and mrs gilmer asked especially after custis we think of going to florida in a few days havent heard from you agnes this is the only letter from his daughter agnes written at this time that can be found my father in his letters to his family left details and particulars for her to describe and doubtless she did so unfortunately there is but this single letter on april 17th he writes again from savannah to my mother my dear mary i have received your letter of the wednesday after our departure and am glad to hear that you are well and getting on so comfortably the destruction of the bridge is really a loss to the community and i fear will inconvenience mildred in her return however the spring is now advancing and they ought to be able to get up the new bridge i hope i am a little better i seem to be stronger and to walk with less difficulty but it may be owing to the better streets of savannah i presume if any change takes place it will be gradual and slow please say to doctor barton that i have received his letter and am obliged to him for his kind advice i shall begin today with his new prescriptions and will follow them strictly tomorrow i expect to go to florida and will stop first at amelia island the visitors to that region are coming out saying the weather is uncomfortably hot if i find it so i shall return savannah has become very pleasant within the last few days and i dare say i shall do as well here as elsewhere the spring however is backward i believe i told you that i was staying with mr andrew lowe who is very kind and where i am very comfortable i am going to be separated from agnes and have received invitations from several of the inhabitants where we could be united but it is awkward to change agnes has been sick too since her arrival which has made me the more anxious to be with her you know she is like her papaalways wanting something she is however better today as i learn though i have not seen her yet i saw her twice yesterday she was better then and came down to mrs lawtons room so i hope she will be well enough to go with me to amelia island the messrs mackay got down from etowa last evening both looking very well and have reopened their old house in broughton street which i am glad of i have see mrs doctor elliot and family the andersons gordons etc etc and all my former acquaintances and many new ones i do not think travelling in this way procures me much quiet and repose i wish i were back give my love to her his daughter mary and to custis and tell the latter i hope that he will be able to keep sam in the seeds he may require praying a merciful god to guard and direct you all i am most affectionately r e lee p si received a letter from f all well r e l sam was the gardener and manofallwork at lexington my father took great interest in his garden and always had a fine one still in savannah he again writes to his wife acknowledging the letters forwarded to him and commenting on the steps being taken savannah georgia april 11 1870 my dear mary i received yesterday your letters of the 3d and 6th inclosing reverend mr brantleys and daughters and cassius lees i forwarded the petition to the president accompanying the latter to cassius and asked him to give it to mr smith hearing while passing through richmond of the decision of the supreme court referred to i sent word to mr smith that if he thought the time and occasion propitious for taking steps for the recovery of arlington the mill etc to do so but to act quietly and discreetly i presume the petition sent you for signature was the consequence i do not know whether this is a propitious time or not and should rather have had an opportunity to consult friends but am unable to do so tell custis that i wish that he would act for me through you or others for it is mainly on his account that i desire the restitution of the property i see that a resolution has been introduced in congress to perfect the title of the government to arlington and other national cemeteries which i have been apprehensive of stirring so i suppose the matter will come up anyhow i did not sign the petition for i did not think it necessary and believed the more i was kept out of sight the better we must hope for the best speak as little and act as discreetly as possible the reverend dr brantley was invited by the faculty of the college to deliver the baccalaureate sermon next june and i invited him and his daughter in the event of his accepting to stay with us do you know whether he has accepted i should have gone to florida last friday as proposed but agnes was not well enough she took cold on the journey or on her first arrival and has been quite sick but is better now i have not seen her this morning but if she is sufficiently recovered we will leave here tomorrow i have received a message saying that she was much better as regards myself my general health is pretty good i feel stronger than when i came the warm weather has also dispelled some of the rheumatic pains in my back but i perceive no change in the stricture in my chest if i attempt to walk beyond a very slow gait the pain is always there it is all true what the doctors say about its being aggravated by any fresh cold but how to avoid taking cold is the question it seems with me to be impossible everything and anything seems to give me one i meet with much kindness and consideration but fear that nothing will relieve my complaint which is fixed and old i must bear it i hope that you will not give over your trip to the white house if you still desire to make it i shall commence my return above the last of april stopping at some points and will be a few days in richmond and the white house if able i must leave to agnes all details give much love to custis mary and mildred tell the latter i have received her letters remember me to all friends most sincerely yours r e lee mrs r e lee after visiting cumberland island and going up to the st johns river as far as palatka and spending the night at colonel coles place near there they returned to savannah colonel cole was on general lees staff as chief commissary during the time he commanded the army of northern virginia and was a very dear friend of us all savannah georgia april 18 1870 my dear mary i have received your letter of the 13th and am glad to learn that you propose visiting the white house as i feared my journey might prevent you i am however very anxious on the subject as i apprehend the trip will be irksome and may produce great inconvenience and pain i hope you received my letter of the 11th written just before my departure for florida in case you did not i will state that i forwarded your petition to cassius lee as received not thinking my signature necessary or advantageous i will send the money received from the university publishing company to carter for whom i intend it this was the money that came to general lee from his new edition of his fathers memoirs of the war in the southern department of the united states i returned from florida saturday 16th having had a very pleasant trip as far as palatka on the st johns we visited comberland island and agnes decorated my fathers grave with beautiful fresh flowers i presume it is the last time i shall be able to pay to it my tribute of respect the cemetery is unharmed and the grave is in good order though the house of dungeness has been burned and the island devastated mr nightingale the present proprietor accompanied me from brunswick mr andrew lowe was so kind as to go with us the whole way thinking agnes and i were unable to take care of ourselves agnes seemed to enjoy the trip very much and has improved in health i shall leave to her all details we spent a night at colonel coles a beautiful place near palatka and ate oranges from the trees we passed some other beautiful places on the river but could not stop at any but jacksonville where we remained from 4 p m to 3 a m next morning rode over the town etc and were hospitably entertained by colonel sanderson the climate was delightful the fish inviting and abundant we have returned to our old quarters agnes to the lawtons and i to the lowes we shall remain here this week and will probably spend a few days in charleston and norfolk if we go that way and at brandon and shirley before going to the white house where we shall hope to meet you i know of no certain place where a letter will catch me before i reach richmond where the doctors desire me to spend a few days that they may again examine me write me there whether fitzhugh is too full to receive us it will depend upon my feelings weather etc whether i make the digression by norfolk poor little agnes has had i fear but little enjoyment so far and i wish her to have all the pleasure she can gather on the route she is still weak and seems to suffer constantly from the neuralgia i hope i am better i know that i am stronger but i still have the pain in my chest whenever i walk i have felt it also occasionally of late when quiescent but not badly which is new today doctors arnold and reed of this city examined me for about an hour they concur in the opinion of the other physicians and think it pretty certain that my trouble arises from some adhesion of the parts not from injury of the lungs and heart but that the pericardium may not be implicated and the adhesion may be between the pleura and i have forgotten the name their visit was at the urgent entreaty of friends which i could not well resist and perhaps their opinion is not fully matured i am continuing the prescriptions of doctors barton and madison my rheumatic pains either from the effects of the medicine or the climate or both have diminished but the pain along the breast bone ever returns on my making any exertion i am glad mildred has returned so well i hope that she will continue so after perusal send this letter to one of the children to whom you may be writing that doctors barton etc may be informed how i am getting along as i have been unable to write to them or to any one at lexington i have so many letters to write in answer to kind invitations etc and so many interruptions that my time is consumed besides writing is irksome to me give my love to fitzhugh tabb and robert and to custis mary and mildred when you write agnes said she was going out to return some of her numerous visits today and i presume will not be able to write she has had but little comfort in her clothes her silk dress was spoiled on the way and she returned it to baltimore but has learned that they can do nothing with it so she will have to do without it which i presume she can do i hope you may reach the white house comfortably i will apprise you of my movements from time to time i hope my godson will know you tell him i have numbers of his namesakes since i left virginia of whom i was not aware i hope they will come to good with great affection r e lee mrs r e lee from the following lettersall that i can find relating to this part of the journeyit appears that the travellers started for virginia stopping at charleston wilmington and norfolk of their visit to charleston i can find no record he and agnes stayed at the beautiful home of mr bennet who had two sons at the college and a lovely daughter mary bennet i remember agnes telling me of the beautiful flowers and other attentions lavished upon them at wilmington they spent a day with mr and mrs davis his coming there was known only to a few persons as its announcement was by a private telegram from savannah but quite a number of ladies and gentlemen secured a small train and went out on the southern road to meet him when they met the regular passengertrain from savannah general lee was taken from it to the private one and welcomed by his many friends he seemed bright and cheerful and conversed with all he spoke of his health not being good and on this account begged that there would be no public demonstration on his arrival nor during his stay at wilmington on reaching that place he accompanied mr george davis attorney general in mr daviss cabinet to his house and was his guest during his sojourn in the city mrs davis was a miss fairfax daughter of dr o fairfax of alexandria virginia they had been and were very old and dear friends and neighbours the next morning my father walked out and called on bishop atkinson with whom he had been well acquainted when they both lived in baltimore some twelve years before the one as rector of st peters episcopal church the other as captain of the united states engineers in charge of the harbour defenses of the city there was a dinner given to my father that day at mr daviss home and a number of gentlemen were present he was looking very well but in conversation said that he realised there was some trouble with his heart which he was satisfied was incurable the next day may 1st he left for norfolk virginia where dr and mrs selden were the kind entertainers of his daughter and himself agnes told me that in going and returning from church the street was lined with people who stood hats off in silent deference from norfolk they visited lower and upper brandon on the james river the homes of the harrisons then shirley higher up the river then they proceeded by way of richmond to the white house my mother having arrived there from lexington a short time previously the general wrote from brandon to his wife brandon may 7 1870 my dear mary we have reached this point on our journey mrs harrison and miss belle are well and very kind and i have been up to see mr william harrison and mr george and their families the former is much better than i expected to find him and i hope will recover his health as the spring advances the ladies are all well and miss gulie is very handsome agnes and i went over to see warrenton carter and his wife this morning they are both very well and everything around them looks comfortable and flourishing they have a nice home and as far as i could see everything is prospering their little boy was asleep but we were invited in to see him he is a true carter mrs page the daughter of general richardson is here on a visit and mrs murdock wife of their former pastor arrived this morning we are to go up to mr george harrisons this evening where the children are to have some tableaux and where we are expected to spend the evening in norfolk we saw all our friends but i did not succeed in getting out to richard pages as i desired on account of the heavy rain on the appointed day and engagements that interfered on others agnes and mrs selden rode out however and saw all the family everybody inquired kindly after you down to bryan and all sent their love brandon is looking very beautiful and it is refreshing to look at the river the garden is filled with flowers and abounds in roses the yellow jasmine is still in bloom and perfumes the atmosphere i have not heard from you or from lexington since i left savannah i hope all are well i am better i trust am getting fat and big but am still rigid and painful in my back on tuesday night i expect to go to shirley and on thursday 12th inst to richmond and on friday to the white house unless i hear that you are crowded in which case i will submit myself to the doctors for two or three days as they desire and then go down agnes now says she will accompany me to the white house so that i shall necessarily pass through richmond as our baggage renders that route necessary therefore unless something unforeseen prevents i shall be with you on friday next all unite in love agnes i hope is better than when she left lexington but is not strong you must give a great deal of love to fitzhugh tabb my grandson robert and all with you most truly and affectionately r e lee p s monday your note of the 6th with colonel allens letter has just been received i am very sorry to hear of tabbs sickness i hope that she will be well by the time of my arrival i shall be glad to see markie r e lee mrs r e lee on the same date he writes to his daughter mildred at lexington brandon may 7 1870 my dear daughter miss jennie is putting up her mail and says that my letter must go with it so i have but a few minutes to inform you that we have reached this point on our way home we stayed a day in wilmington with the davises after leaving charleston and several with the seldens in norfolk and shall on tuesday next go up to shirley and then to the white house agnes threatens to abandon me at shirley and i wish that you were there to take her place i am better i hope certainly am stronger and have less pain but am far from comfortable and have little ability to move or do anything though am growing large and fat perhaps that is the cause all here are well and send love miss belle very sweet all very kind i rode yesterday to the other brandons and saw all the inhabitants captain shirley spent the day here mr wm harrison much better and miss gulie very pretty they have some visitors it is quiet and delightful here the river is beautiful agnes will write when she finds time which is a scarce commodity with her i had intended to write before breakfast the longest portion of the day but walked out and forgot it we have little time after breakfast give much love to mary and custis i hope that you are all well and comfortable i was very glad to receive your letter the morning i left savannah and i hope that mrs smith and traveller are enjoying themselves i hope to get back to lexington about the 24th but will write after paying my visit to the white house i will have to spend some days in richmond and at the doctors request as they wish to examine me again and more thoroughly i hope all are well at the college remember me to all there and in lexington with affectionate love your father r e lee miss mildred lee the white house my brothers home at that time is on the pamunkey river about twentyfive miles north of shirley from my fathers letter it is evident he had thought of driving over instead of going by boat and rail through richmond this plan was abandoned when his daughter determined to accompany him as a ladys baggage even in those days was too voluminous for private conveyance mr wm harrison lived at upper brandon and mr george harrison at middle brandon the mistress of lower brandon the old historic home was mrs isabella ritchie harrison widow of the late george harrison miss jennie referred to in the above letter was miss virginia ritchie sister of mrs harrison she had succeeded in having a postoffice established at lower brandon and herself made postmistress this was done for the convenience of the brandons and the immediate neighbourhood the proceeds miss jennie gave to the brandon church of his visit to shirley his mothers home when she was a girl and where she was married to light horse harry i can find no account written at the time it is a few hours from brandon to shirley by steamer on the beautiful james and they arrived there tuesday may 10th and left the following thursday by steamer for richmond so says the home journal kept at shirley all the country came to see him and there was a large party to dinner one of the daughters of the house then a young girl says i can only remember the great dignity and kindness of general lees bearing how lovely he was to all of us girls that he gave us his photographs and write his name on them he liked to have us tickle his hands but when cousin agnes came to sit by him that seemed to be her privilege we regarded him with the greatest veneration we had heard of god but here was general lee my mother was now at the white house i will here introduce portions of a letter of the 9th and 13th of may from her to her daughter in lexington telling of my fathers arrival on the 12th white house may 9 1870 fitzhugh took us on a delightful drive this morning dear mildred to tunstalls where we got your letter and markie got nine including yours so we were much gratified with our excursion the road was fine with the exception of a few mudholes and the woods lovely with wild flowers and dogwood blossoms and with all the fragrance of early spring the dark holly and pine intermingling with the delicate leaves just brought out by the genial season daisies wild violets and heartsease i have not seen so many wild flowers since i left arlington thirteenthi determined after commencing this to wait and see your papa who arrived last evening with agnes he looks fatter but i do not like his complexion and he seems still stiff i have not yet had time to hear much of their tour except a grand dinner given them at mr benets your papa sends his love and says he will be in lexington somewhere about the 24th there is no news the country becomes more lovely each day the locust trees are in full bloom and the polonia the only tree left of all that were planted by poor charlotte and myself how all our labours have come to naught the general has just come in robbie is riding on his knee sitting as grave as a judge he says now markie agnes and many other words and calls me bonne mama we expect rob this morning yours affectionately m c lee at this time my father was persuaded to make me a visit he had been invited before when at different times he had been to the white house but something had hitherto always prevented his coming now he decided to come my romancoke farm was situated in king william county on the opposite side of the pamunkey river and some fifteen miles east of white house we arrived there in the afternoon having come down by the steamer which at that time ran from white house to baltimore romancoke had been always a dependency of the white house and was managed by an overseer who was subordinate to the manager on the latter estate there was on it only a small house of the size usual in our country for that character of property i had taken possession in 1866 and was preparing to build a more comfortable residence but in the meantime i lived in the house which had been occupied by the different overseers for about seventyfive years its accommodations were very limited simple and it was much out of repair owing to the settling of the underpinning in the centre it had assumed a swaybacked outline which gave it the name of the brokenback house no repairs had been attempted as i was preparing to build a new home my father always dignified and selfcontained rarely gave any evidence of being astonished or startled his selfcontrol was great and his emotions were not on the surface but when he entered and looked around my bachelor quarters he appeared really much shocked as i was much better off in the matter of housekeeping than i had been for four years i flattered myself that i was doing very well i can appreciate fully now what he must have felt at the time however he soon rallied and concealed his dismay by making kindly fun of my surroundings the next day at dinner he felt obliged to remark on my china knives and forks and suggested that i might at least better my holdings in that line when he got back to richmond he sent me a full set of plated forks and spoons which i have been using from that day to this he walked and drove over the farm discussed my plans for improvement and was much interested in all my work advising me about the site of my new house new barns icehouse etc he evidently enjoyed his visit for the quiet and the rest were very refreshing about thirty miles as the crow flies from my place down york river is situated in gloucester county white marsh an old virginia home which then belonged to dr prosser tabb who with his wife and children was living there mrs tabb was a near cousin of my father and as a little girl had been a pet and favourite his affection and regard for her had lasted from his early manhood he had seen but little of her since the war and when cousin rebecca as we called her learned he was to be at the white house she wrote begging him to pay her a visit this he had agreed to do if it was possible while at the white house we had consulted together as to the best method of accomplishing this trip and we determined to make it from romancoke so i drove him to west point and there got aboard the baltimore steamer taking my horse and trap with us at cappahoosic a wharf on the york we landed and drove the nine miles to white marsh arriving at supper time as we still say in virginiaie about 730 p m when general lee got off on the wharf so great was the desire of the passengers and crew to see him that they all went to the side of the boat which caused her to list so that i was unable to get my horse out through the gangway until the captain had ordered every one to the other side as the sun went down it became chilly and i drove quite rapidly anxious to get my father out of the night air as soon as possible he said nothing at the time nor did i know that he noticed my unusual speed but afterward he remarked on it to several persons saying i think rob drives unnecessarily fast we were expected and were met at the door by all the family and guests a hearty welcome was given us after supper he was the centre of the circle in the drawingroom and made the acquaintance of the children of the house and of the friends and relatives of the family who were there he said little but all listened eagerly to what he did say and were charmed with his pleasant smile and gracious manner cousin rebecca introduced him to her soninlaw captain perrin mentioning that he had been wounded in the war and was still lame from the effects the general replied that at any rate he was all right now for he had a pair of strong young feet to wait upon him indicating his young wife as was customary in this section of virginia the house was full of visitors and i shared my fathers room and bed though many a year had passed since we had been bedfellows he told me that he remembered well the time when as a little fellow i had begged for this privilege the next day he walked about the beautiful gardens and was driven over the plantation and shown the landscapes and water views of the immediate neighborhood mr graves dr tabbs overseer who had the honour of being his coachman fully appreciated it and was delighted when my father praised his management he had been a soldier under the general and had stoutly carried his musket to appomatox where he surrendered it when told of this by dr tabb my father took occasion to compliment him on his steadfast endurance and courage but graves simply and sincerely replied yes general i stuck to the army but if you had in your entire command a greater coward than i was you ought to have had him shot my father who was greatly amused at his candour spoke of it when he got back from his drive saying that sort of a coward makes a good soldier that the drive had fatigued him was quite apparent to cousin rebecca who begged him to go and lie down to rest but he declined though finally at her request he consented to take a glass of wine mrs tabb was anxious to give a general reception that day in his honour so that all the old soldiers in the country could have an opportunity of shaking hands with him but at the generals request the idea was abandoned several persons were invited to meet him at dinner among them the rev mr phillips an englishman the rector of abingdon an old colonial church in the country he and his wife were ardent admirers of general lee and had often expressed a great desire to see him so mrs tabb kindly gave them this opportunity they were charmed with him and writing to their friends in england declared the greatest event in our lives has occurredwe have seen general lee one of his young cousins in talking with him wondered what fate was in store for us poor virginians the general replied with an earnest softened look you can work for virginia to build her up again to make her great again you can teach your children to love and cherish her i was struck with the tenderness of his manner to all these cousins many of whom he had never seen before and the real affection and interest he manifested toward them he seemed pleased and touched by their love and kindness i think he enjoyed this visit but it was plain that he was easily fatigued to catch our steamer the next morning an early start was necessary arrangements were made the night before and all goodbyes said for we had to leave the house about five oclock that night he was very restless and wakeful and remarked that it was generally so with him whenever he had to get up at an unusual hour as he was always uneasy lest he might be late however we got off in full timemade the connection with our steamer and returned immediately to the white house i left the steamer at west point to take my horse home after which i joined him at the former place after a short stay at the white house he started for lexington stopping over in richmond for a few days from there he writes to his daughter mildred in lexington richmond virginia may 23 1870 my precious daughter i came up from the white house this morning with agnes but she threatens to divorce herself from me and we have already separated she is at dr fairfaxs and i am at mr mcfarlands she promises however to see me occasionally and if i can restore our travelling relations even at costly sacrifice i shall be happy to take her along with me i find i shall be detained here too long to take the wednesdays boat from lynchburg but if not prevented by circumstances now not foreseen i shall take the fridays boat so as to reach lexington saturday morning 28th inst if sam is well enough and it should be otherwise convenient he could meet me with lucy and the carriage or with traveller if not i will get a seat up in the omnibus your mother proposes to leave in the boat for bremo on the 1st proximo spend one week there and then continue her journey to lexington agnes has not yet made up her mind whether she will go with me her mother or remain for a while i hope to find you well though alone i must reserve all accounts till we meet which i am very anxious should take place as soon as practicable i am improving i think in general health but cannot tell certainly as to the difficulty in my chest as i have been unable to test my progress i had a pleasant visit to f and robert and enjoyed rest there which i wanted love to custis and kind regards to all friends i hope that i shall find all well and doing well all at the white house send love poor tabb is still sick markie williams is with your mother robert came up with us but returns this evening i have seen dr houston this morning and i am to have a great medicine talk tomorrow your devoted father r e lee miss mildred lee baltimorealexandriaa wartalk with cousin cassius leeravensworthletter to doctor buckler declining invitation to europeto general cooperto mrs lee from the hot springstired of public placespreference for country life judged by what he says of himself my fathers trip south did him no permanent good the rest and change the meeting with many old friends the great love and kindness shown him by all gave him much pleasure and for a time it was thought he was better but the main cause of his troubles was not removed though for a while held in check during the month of june he remained in lexington was present at the final examinations of the college and attended to all his duties as usual on july 1st he went to baltimore in order to consult dr thomas h buckler about his health while there he stayed with mr and mrs tagart my mother had returned to lexington after her visit to bremo together with my sister agnes to her on july 2d he writes baltimore maryland july 2 1870 my dear mary i reached her yesterday evening at 915 p m found mr tagart at the depot waiting for me where he had been since eight oclock thanks to his having a punctual wife who regulates everything for him so that he had plenty of time for reflection i believe however the delay was occasioned by change of schedule that day of which mrs tagart was not advised we arrived at alexandria at 500 p m and were taken to washington and kept in the cars till 745 when we were sent on it was the hottest day i ever experienced or i was in the hottest position i ever occupied both on board the packet and in the railroad cars or i was less able to stand it for i never recollect having suffered so much dr buckler came in to see me this morning and examined me stripped for two hours he says he finds my lungs working well the action of the heart a little too much diffused but nothing to injure he is inclined to think that my whole difficulty arises from rheumatic excitement both the first attack in front of fredericksburg and the second last winter says i appear to have a rheumatic constitution must guard against cold keep out in the air exercise etc as the other physicians prescribe he will see me again in the meantime he has told me to try lemonjuice and watch the effect i will endeavour to get out to washington peters on the 4th and to goodwood as soon as dr b is satisfied mr and mrs tagart are very well and send regards the messenger is waiting to take this to the office it is raining and i have not been out nor seen any one out of the house i hope all are well with you and regret that i was obliged to come away tell the girls i was so overcome that i could not get up this morning till 800 a m give much love to everybody and believe me most truly r e lee the advantages of early rising my father ever held out to his daughters so that he knew they would enjoy hearing of his being late in getting down in the morning during this visit to baltimore he took advantage of his proximity to many old friends to visit them his next letter is from alexandria to my mother alexandria virginia july 15 1870 my dear mary i arrived here last evening from goodwood and was glad to hear from burke this morning that our aunt maria was as well as usual i wish to get out to cassius lees this afternoon and will spend tomorrow on the hill in visiting general

i shall proceed to lexington it is so hot that i shall be obliged to forego my visit to nannie and the white house it is intensely hot here and i am unable to bear the heat now i took cold yesterday in the cars or elsewhere and am full of pains this morning and was unable to sleep last night i have seen mr smith mr francis l smith was my fathers lawyer the matter referred to which caused the remark the prospect is not promising was the chance of getting back the estate of arlington from the u s government mr smith and mr cassius lee were my fathers advisers in this matter nannie was the widow of captain s s lee my fathers brother this morning and had with him a long business talk and will see him again after seeing cassius the prospect is not promising i got your letter at charless

until i caught fresh cold but no one can avoid it in such weather love to all i cannot fix yet the day of my return but it will be the last week in july i hope custis has got off though i shall not be able to see him most truly and affectionately r e lee mrs r e lee mr cassius lee was my fathers first cousin they had been children together schoolmates in boyhood and lifelong friends and neighbours he was my fathers trusted adviser in all business matters and in him he had the greatest confidence mr cazenove lee of washington d c his son has kindly furnished me with some of his recollections of this visit which i give in his own words it is greatly to be regretted that an accurate and full account of this visit was not preserved for the conversations during those two or three days were most interesting and would have filled a volume it was the review of a lifetime by two old men it is believed that general lee never talked after the war with as little reserve as on this occasion only my father and two of his boys were present i can remember his telling my father of meeting mr leary their old teacher at the alexandria academy during his late visit to the south which recalled many incidents of their school life they talked of the war and he told of the delay of jackson in getting on mcclellans flank causing the fight at mechanicsville which fight he said was unexpected but was necessary to prevent mcclellan from entering richmond from the front of which most of the troops had been moved he thought that if jackson had been at gettysburg he would have gained a victory for said he jackson would have held the heights which ewell took on the first day he said that ewell was a fine officer but would never take the responsibility of exceeding his orders and having been ordered to gettysburg he would not go farther and hold the heights beyond the town i asked him which of the federal generals he considered the greatest and he answered most emphatically mcclellan by all odds he was asked why he did not come to washington after second manassas because he replied my men had nothing to eat and pointing to fort wade in the rear of our home he said i could not tell my men to take that fort when they had had nothing to eat for three days i went to maryland to feed my army this led to a statement of the mismanagement of the confederate commissary department of which he gave numerous instances and mentioned his embarrassments in consequence he was also very severe in his criticism of the newspapers and said that patriotism did not seem to influence them in the least that movements of the army were published which frustrated their plans and as an instance he told of longstreets being sent to the western army and the efforts that were made to keep the movement secret but to no purpose the papers having heralded it at once to friend and foe alike i also remember his saying that he advocated putting the negroes in the army and the arguments he advanced in favour of it my father remarked at table one day that he could not have starved in the confederate service if he could have gotten bread and milk no replied the general but frequently i could not get even that his love of children was most marked and he never failed to show them patient consideration on the occasion of this visit his answers to all our boyish questions were given with as much detail and as readily as if we had been the most important men in the community several years before the war i remember that my sister brother and myself all young children drove over to arlington mills and that while going there colonel lee rode up on a beautiful black horse he impressed my childish fancy then as the handsomest and finest horseman i had ever seenthe beauideal of a soldier upon seeing us he at once stopped spoke to each of us and took my sister then about ten years of age upon his horse before him and rode with us for two miles telling her i remember of his boy robby who had a pony and who should be her sweetheart often have i seen him on the road or street or elsewhere and though i was only a boy he always stopped and had something pleasant to say to me the mr leary mentioned here was my fathers teacher when a boy in alexandria his regard and esteem for him was very high as is shown in the following letter lexington virginia december 15 1866 mr wm b leary my dear sir your visit has recalled to me years long since passed when i was under your tuition and received daily your instruction in parting from you i beg to express the gratitude i have felt all my life for the affectionate fidelity which characterised your teaching and conduct toward me should any of my friends wherever your lot may be cast desire to know your qualifications as a teacher i hope you will refer them to me for that is a subject on which i can speak knowingly and from experience wishing you health happiness and prosperity i am affectionately your friend r e lee his next letter is from ravensworth where he went after his visit to the seminary hill ravensworth virginia july 20 1870 my dear mary i arrived here yesterday from alexandria and found aunt maria well in general health but less free to walk than when i last saw her she is cheerful and quiet but seems indisposed to try any of the healing baths or indeed any of the remedies resorted to in cases of similar character and seems to think nothing will be of avail i hope in time that she will be relieved her niece mrs goldsborough the daughter of her sister wilhelmina is with her she seems to be a nice little ladyhas a big boy of eight months and is expecting her husband tomorrow so nothing need be said more on her account mr dickens was over last evening and reports all well with him all the family are to be over this evening so i cannot say more of them ravensworth is looking very welli mean the house and grounds but little of the farm seems to be cultivated and is growing up with pines i received your letter directed to alexandria after my return from my visit to cassius also colonel williamsons resolutions will not build the church it will require money mr smith did not give so favourable an account of mr price as did mr green i did not see mr p for it would have been of no avail without having the plans etc and i cannot wait here to receive them i shall have to send them or to invite him to lexington after my return i propose to leave here if nothing prevents on monday 25th inst if i go by goshen i hope to reach lexington that night or tuesday morning after breakfast i have heard a rumour that the water has been withdrawn from the canal above lynchburg for the purpose of repairs if that is so i shall have to go by goshen my cold continues but is better the weather is very hot and to me is almost insupportable at 600 p m yesterday the thermometer in ravensworth hall marked 86 degrees this morning when i first went out it stood at 84 degrees thank agnes for her letter i cannot respond at this time the letter you forwarded from mrs podestad describes the sickness her children have passed through she is now with them at capon and miss emily has gone to visit mrs barksdale in greenbrier mrs p says she will be ready to visit you any time after the middle of august that you will notify her i am glad all are well with you and hope the garden will give you some vegetables i am anxious to get back and see you all give much love to the girls including the misses selden tell them they must not leave till i return that i am hurrying back as fast as rheumatism will let me i have abandoned my visit to nannie and the boys on the pamunkey tell them it is too hot and that i am too painful aunt m sends love to all remember me to all friends i must leave details till i return most truly and affectionately r e lee mrs r e lee the building of the church here referenced to was the episcopal church in lexington which it was proposed to take down and replace with a larger and better building my father was a vestryman and also a member of the building committee dr buckler whom my father had consulted in july was at this time on a visit to baltimore having lived abroad with his family since 1866 when about to return to paris he wrote and asked my father to accompany him this invitation he was obliged to decline lexington virginia august 5 1870 my dear doctor i have just received your letter of the 4th inviting me to accompany you across the atlantic and i return you my cordial thanks for your kind solicitation for my health and comfort there is no one whom i would prefer to have as a companion on the voyage nor is there one i am sure who would take better care of me but i cannot impose myself upon you i have given you sufficient trouble already and you must cure me on this side of the atlantic if you are the man i take you for you will do so you must present my warmest thanks to your wife for her remembrance of me and her kind offer of the hospitalities of her house should i ever be able to visit europe i shall certainly accept them but i hope she will soon return to this country and that you will bring her up to the mountains to us we are all peaceable here now and she will find that we are not as bad as we have been reported to be and every one will extend to her a hearty welcome whereas europe is now convulsed with the horrors of war or the agony of its expectancy and i fear for a season is destined to feel the greatest calamity that can befall a people i am pursuing your directions and hope that i am deriving benefit from them i have made my arrangements to visit the hot springs virginia on monday next as you recommended and trust i may find relief from them my rheumatic pains continue but have diminished and that in my shoulder i think has lessened under the application of the blister i shall endeavour to be well by the fall the letter you inclosed to me was from mrs smith on the hudsonand not from mr henry white as you supposed goodbye my dear doctor may you have a prosperous voyage and find your family all well on your arrival and may your own health be entirely restored my family unite with me in every kind wish and i am most truly your friend r e lee dr thomas h buckler this letter to general cooper adjutant general of the confederate states army written at this time explains itself and is one of many witnesses of my fathers delicate consideration for old soldiers in distress lexington virginia august 4 1870 general s cooper alexandria virginia my dear general impressed with all the people of the south with your merits and services i have with them admired your manly efforts to support your family and have regretted that more remunerative occupation better suited to your capacities and former habits had not presented itself this has been a subject of conversation with some of us here and when in savannah last spring i presented it to general lawton colonel cole and others and suggested that efforts be made to raise a sum for the relief of any pressing necessity the idea was cordially adopted and it was hoped that an amount would be contributed that would enable you to receive some relaxation i have received a letter from general lawton regretting the smallness of the sum collected 300 and explaining the delay that had occurred the general poverty of the people the many calls upon them and the disposition to procrastinate when facts are not known to them personally to this sum i have only been able to add 100 but i hope it may enable you to supply some immediate want and prevent you from taxing your strength too much you must also pardon me for my moving in this matter and for the foregoing explanation which i feel obliged to make that you might understand the subject with my best wishes for your health and happiness and for the useful prolongation of your honourable life i am with true regard your friend and servant r e lee he remained at lexington only for a short time as it was decided that he should go to the hot springs virginia where he could try their famous waters for his rheumatism on the day of his arrival he writes to my mother hot springs bath county virginia august 10 1870 my dear mary we reached here this morning about 930 a m captain white and i after as pleasant a journey as we could have expected after taking the cars at goshen the old route by milboro rose up so strong before me that we determined to adhere to it reached the bath alum about 400 p m where we passed the night and were in luck in finding several schools or parts of them rusticating on alumwater mrs heath was in charge of the detachment from dr phillipss a well known girls school at staunton they presented a gay and happy appearance this morning we breakfasted at the warm and had the attention of richard there is a small party there admiral louis goldsborough and his wife and miss west amongst them here thee is quite a company mrs lemmon from baltimore her daughter mrs dobbin mrs general walker wife of the exsecretary of war of the confederacy mrs and miss sivent etc etc dr and mrs cabell are here and the tandys and mrs mac regret that you are not with mei saw mrs maise at the warm and her sister from kentucky mrs tate rev mr mason and the daingerfields have a girls school in the village the warm seems to be retrograding i hope the new man edward has arrived tell him to take good care of the cow and ask the girls to see to it and the garden etc i saw mrs caskie at the baths she looks very well her niece gay is with her a pretty child mrs myers and her children are also there mrs asher also small company but select all pleased with mr brown the manager of the hotel tell the girls i have no one to rub me now shall miss them in this and other ways much dr cabell says i must continue my medicines and commence with the hot spout tomorrow he has great confidence in the waters and says that 95 out of 100 patients that he has treated have recovered i shall alternate the spout with the boiler but he says the great error is that people become impatient and do not stay long enough i hope i may be benefited but it is a tedious prospect i hope that you all will continue well if you wish to go to the baths or to come here you must do so and write me what you want if there is anything i can do or get for you give love to all the girls and remembrances to all friends tell our neighbours that i was so occupied the last days i was in lexington that i had not time to bid them adieu if you want more money let me

for the garden and stable the letters written to my mother and others of his family from the hot springs at this time were frequent and i give them in full as they tell all we know now of his visit there hot springs bath county virginia august 14 1870 my dear mary i received this morning the last letters forwarded by you the first batch arrived yesterday i am glad to hear that you all continue well i hope my letter of the 10th announcing my arrival has reached you it should have done so it seems to me previously to your note of friday i have but little more to say than i had them i have taken four baths hot spout which seems to agree with me very well but it is too soon yet to look for results i receive the water on my shoulder back and chest the sensation is pleasant and so far i have succeeded in preventing taking cold the atmosphere however is damp and temperature variable when the sun shines it is hot but when it rains which is the usual condition of the weather the former the exception it is cool mrs sledge and party are here the former improved she was much better went over to the white and sweet retrograded and returned will stay here september many of our invalids are improving society has a rather solemn appearance and conversation runs mostly on personal ailments baths and damp weather there were some pretty tableaux last evening the misses tardy mrs dobbin and the little girls the performers mr washington william washington a well known painter of that day who was for a short time professor of painting and drawing at the virginia military institute at lexington is here he looks well is quiet and has been copying points of scenery in the neighbourhood i do not know whether he was in search of health or the picturesque the latter is more easily found in these mountains than the former captain white is well and sends remembrances to all i hope edward has arrived and is an improvement on the present occupant of the situation if he does not present himself retain henry till i come i will endeavour to find some one you do not mention the cow she is of more interest to me than the cats and is equally destructive of rats i am glad the girls are well what are they troubling about now i wish they were with me i find many ladies here for neuralgia mrs general walker has been much benefited also others if little agnes should desire to try the effects of the waters tell her to come on i will take care of her i suppose tabb will go with her husband i am sorry fitzhugh is complaining i have written to rob and miss lottie miss charlotte haxall afterward mrs robert e lee jr who died in 1872 i heard of charles carters charles carter of goodwood maryland was my fathers first cousin mildred and ella two of his daughters passing up the road to the white and mildred preceded him a week ella i hear is much improved i shall not go to the white unless specially called by something now unknown but will remain here till the end of the month if i find it profitable and then return to lexington i hope the college is prospering what does mrs podestad say i understand that markie peter mrs peter was a near cousin of my mother and with her as a little girl our associations had been very near and child are occupying her old quarters at the lomaxes near warrenton i have a merry time with my old cronies tell mildred i am getting too heavy for them now they soon drop me i am getting uneasy about edward and blanche the reverses of the french which seem to be light appear to have demoralised the nation may god help all in affliction and keep and guard you and all with you is my constant prayer truly and affectionately r e lee mrs m c lee hot springs bath county virginia august 19 1870 my dear mary i received this morning your letters of the 14th and 18th inclosing dr bucklers and was informed by colonel turner that he had brough the package to which you referred he has not yet sent it to me but no doubt will in time i am sorry that edward has not kept his engagement for i liked his appearance and recommendations though perhaps they are deceptive you had better retain harry till i come unless you fall in with a better i am glad that you are all well you have such industrious little daughters that i am sure all will go well thank agnes for her letter and say to her that i have not seen mr vanmeter or blair but gave the letter to the former to colonel white who will send it to him when he finds out his position mr thom arrived this morning and mr john jones and family rode over from the healing they are there for a sick child my old friend dr broaddus and the reverend mr jones also presented themselves i have been trying the boiler for four daysand the spout the five preceding i do not perceive any benefit yet though some little change in the seat of my pains i will continue till the middle of next week the 29th when if no decided improvement takes place i think of going over to the healing dr houston thinks that it will be beneficial whereas dr cabell recommends this i am obliged to be in staunton on the 30th ult to attend a meeting of the valley railroad company so i shall leave here on the 29th for that purpose after getting through with that business i shall return to lexington i am sorry that i shall be called away but i fear my stay here would be of no avail colonel white is well and sends regards to all i am glad that the cow is better she stands next in my affections to traveller i hope that agness neuralgia is better and as she has not accepted my proposition i presume she declines hot bathing is not agreeable to me either in its operations or effects but i see daily evidences of its good results on others i wish that it suited your case you must try and get some one in sallys place if tabb etc come and make them all comfortable if you want more money let me know in time send over to mr leyburn for the flour when you want it mr bowie i suspect can arrange it for you i fear captain brookss house will not be ready for occupancy this fall i hope that general smith will begin custiss in time i heard of him on his way to edward cockes the other day mr washington is still here better i think again love to all most truly and affectionately r e lee psmr turner has just sent me the package r e l to his son fitzhugh who was at the white house with his family hot springs bath county virginia august 20 1870 my dear fitzhugh i am very sorry to learn from your letter of the 18th received this morning that tabb is sick i hope that it will be of short duration and that she will soon throw off the chills the mountain doctors however do not understand them as well as the lowland and are apt to resort to the old practice i wish that i could get to the white to see you but my time is too limited owing to the late day that i was able to leave lexington i propose staying here till the 29th inst which will only make my sojourn here two and a half weeks and then going to staunton where i am obliged to attend a meeting of the valley railroad company on the 30th i hope that i shall not be detained there longer than a day or two when i will return to lexington where i hope to find you all you must tell mr and mrs podestad mr carter ella etc how sorry i am not to see them at the white but that i hope they will call at lexington i wrote to ella on my first arrival here but presume my letter failed to reach her you did not mention how her health was i am much concerned at tabbs indisposition but am glad to hear that the baby is well give my love to both and i trust you will all be benefited by the mountain air my personal health is good but i see no change in my rheumatic attack which is principally confined to my chest and back i inclose a note from your mother transmitted on the supposition that i would write to you professor white is with me and i have some few acquaintances but i am anxious to return i am glad that bertus has had a short visit to the orange he says that he will come to rockbridge in september custis will be there by the first and we shall all i hope be together again affectionately r e lee hot springs bath county virginia august 23 1870 my dear mary i have received your various notes of the 17th and 18th and i am glad to hear of your wellbeing our good cow will be a loss to us but her troubles are all over now and i am grateful to her for what she has done for us i hope that we did our duty to her i have written to mr andrew cameron to inquire about a young cow he has of mine and asked him to let you know if she is giving milk if his report is good you had better send for her she is however young and will require very gentle treatment caution henry on that point i have told him mr c also that you would send for the horses which i wish you would do as soon as you can see that they will be properly cared for tell henry to be particularly gentle and kind to them or the gray will give him great trouble he must wash them clean and not pull out their manes and tails the girls will have to exercise them till custis comes i suppose we may give up expecting edward retain henry till you can find someone better you had also better engage some woman or man for a month as a diningroom servant i think easter has not intention of coming to us before october and she will not come then if mr can keep her you will have so many friends staying with you that you cannot make them comfortable unless you have more servants as i stated in a previous letter i shall go to staunton on the 29th i hope i shall be detained but a few days lest your funds may run low i send you a check the girls can get it cashed i may be detained but i hope to return in time to see our children and friends i have been here a fortnight today i hope that i am better but am aware of no material change except that i am weaker i am very anxious to get back it is very wearying at these public places and the benefit hardly worth the cost i do not think i can even stand lexington long colonels allan and johnston professors wm allan and william preston johnston of washington college the former afterward principal of the mcdonough school near baltimore maryland the latter president of tulane university new orleans arrived this evening on horseback and have given me all lexington news mr sledge and his wife from huntsville brother of the colonel also arrived and a mr and mrs leeds from new orleans with ten children mostly little girls the latter are a great addition to my comfort i have written to fitzhugh and mrs podestad robert you know said he would make his annual visit the first week in september tell the girls they must make preparations to welcome all mrs walker wife of the former secretary of war in the confederacy is here with her son whom she says she is anxious to place in the college and wishes to visit lexington with that view i have offered my escort and invited her to stay with us i do not know whether she will go with me the girls will have to prepare my room for some of the visitors and put me anywhere i can be very comfortable in the library tell the little creatures they must work like beavers and get a supply of eggs and chickens recollect there is flour at leyburns mill when you want it thank mildred for her letter remember me to all and believe me always yours affectionately r e lee mrs m c lee psi send you an order for the horses tell henry to take with him a bridle and halter you must write for the cow if you want her r e lee mr andrew cameron owned a fine farm near lexington and kindly took care of my fathers horses when he was away in the summer also at different times supplied him with a cow and took care of any calf if there happened to be one till it was of service my father constantly rode out to see him and enjoyed talking farming as they rode together over his fields his delight in every aspect of nature was real and ever present these letters show too his care and consideration for animals his letter to his daughter agnes is in lighter vein his playful moods so usual with his children never entirely left him hot springs bath county virginia august 23 1870 my dear agnes i have received both of your letters the last the 17th and thank you for them as well as for your care of my room and clothes the former i understand is used for a multiplicity of purposes and the cats and kittens have the full run of my establishment guard me against miss selden mildreds kitten i pray you i am sorry that you are not with me as it possibly may have benefitted your neuralgia but if miss belle is with you i am sure she will be of greater service and tell her she must remain till i come that she may cure me that you may have some other inducements than your flowers and weeds to take you out of doors i will write to your mother and send for the horses as soon as she can make arrangements to have them cared for and then you and mildred and miss belle the one on traveller the other on lucy can scour the country and keep us in eggs and chickens i am sorry for the death of our good cow but glad that she is out of misery i do not think any of your friends are here mr washington has been vibrating between this place and the healing but does not seem to be well miss alman from salem massachusetts whom you may recollect as having been at the white last summer is here with her father and mother miss mollie jourdan left today and colonel robert preston arrived the chestnuts and le verts are still here i hope that you are well and that all is well with you when custis comes ask him to see to the horses and the cow and that they are gently treated and properly fed i know nothing of henrys capacity in that way i hope to be home next week and am very anxious to get back your father r e lee letter to his wifeto mr tagartobituary notice in personal reminiscences of general robert e leemrs lees account of his death the following is the last letter that i can find written by my father to my mother he was back in lexington early in september and was never separated from her again while he lived hot springs august 27 1870 my dear mary i have received your letter of the 22d i should remain here a week longer if time permitted as i have felt in the last few days better than i have yet but i am obliged to be in staunton on the 30th and therefore must leave monday 29th i should not have time to return here the college opens on september 15th and i wish to see that all things are prepared possibly the little improvement now felt will continue if not i shall have to bear my malady i am truly sorry to hear of edwin lees death colonel edwin grey lee was a near cousin he had distinguished himself in the late war at its commencement he had volunteered and was made a 2d lieutenant in the second virginia regiment stonewall brigade from that rank he quickly rose to be lieutenant colonel of the 33d virginia in the same brigade in 1862 his health which was very feeble compelled him to resign but after a short time he again entered the service though he never became strong enough to serve actively in the field general lees opinion of his abilities was very high he was a true man and if health had permitted would have been an ornament as well as a benefit to his race he certainly was a great credit to the name give my sincere sympathy to his wife and family you have never mentioned anything of dr grahame i have heard that he was in a critical condition i saw colonels allan and johnston they only stayed a day and went on to the white i have heard of them on their return and presume they will reach lexington tomorrow mr george taylor who has been a month at the white arrived here today both he and his wife are well the company is thinning though arrivals occur daily mr middleton and his daughter and son from washington whom you may recollect also came but i hope to see you so soon that i will defer my narrative i am glad that mary is enjoying herself and that rob is so happy may both long continue so i will endeavour to get the muslin but fear i shall not succeed i trust i may not be detained in staunton more than a day or two in that event you may expect me thursday september 1st but i cannot say as to time i hope that i shall find you all well give my love to agnes and mildred and custis if he has arrived colonel turner is very well tell his wife that he was exhibited today at the healing as a specimen of the health of the hot in my last i gave you my views about the servants and sent you a check for which i hope that you have received most truly and affectionately r e lee his last letter was written on the morning of the day he was taken ill september 28th it was to mr tagert of baltimore at whose home he had stayed the previous summer its tone was cheerful and hopeful and he wrote that he was much better and stronger lexington virginia september 28 1870 my dear mr tagart your note of the 26th reached me this morning and see how easy it is to inveigle me into a correspondence in fact when a man desires to do a thing or when a thing gives a man pleasure he requires but small provocation to induce him to do it now i wanted to hear how you and mrs tagart were what you were doing and how you had passed the summer and i desired to tell you so that is the reason i write in answer to your question i reply that i am much better i do not know whether it is owing to having seen you and doctor buckler last summer or to my visit to the hot springs perhaps both but my pains are less and my strength greater in fact i suppose i am as well as i shall be i am still following doctor bs directions and in tie i may improve still more i expect to have to visit baltimore this fall in relation to the valley railroad and in that event i hope to see you if you will permit me i am glad to hear that you spent a pleasant summer colonel and i would have had a more agreeable one had you been with us at the hot and as every place agrees so well with mrs tagert i think she could have enjoyed as good health their as at saratoga and we should have done better give my sincere regards to mrs tagart and remember me to all friends particularly mr tell his brother is well and handsome and i hope that he will study or his sweethearts in baltimore will not pine for him long captain is well and busy and joins in my remembrances mrs lee and my daughters unite with me in messages to you and mrs tagart and i am most truly yours r e lee s h tagart esq when my brother fitzhugh and i reached lexington my father was no more he died the morning of our arrivaloctober 12th he had apparently improved after his first attack and the summoning of my brother and myself had been put off from day to day after we did start we were delayed by the floods which at that time prevailed over the state of his last illness and death i have heard from my family the best account of those last days was written by colonel william preston johnston for the personal reminiscences of general robert e lee by the rev j w jones published in 1874 colonel johnston was an intimate friend of the general and a distinguished member of the faculty of his college he was also one of the watchers by his dying bedside i therefore give it in full the death of general lee was not due to any sudden cause but was the result of agencies dating as far back as 1863 in the trying campaign of that year he contracted a severe sore throat that resulted in rheumatic inflammation of the sac inclosing his heart there is no doubt that after this sickness his health was more or less impaired and although he complained little yet rapid exercise on foot or on horseback produced pain and difficulty breathing in october 1869 he was again attacked by inflammation of the heartsac accompanied by muscular rheumatism of the back right side and arms the action of the heart was weakened by this attack the flush upon the face deepened the rheumatism increased and he was troubled with weariness and depression in march 1870 general lee yielding to the solicitations of friends and medical advisors make a sixweeks visit to georgia and florida he returned greatly benefited by the influence of the genial climate the society of friends in those states and the demonstrations of respect and affection of the people of the south his physical condition however was not greatly improved during this winter and spring he had said to his son general custis lee that his attack was mortal and had virtually expressed the same belief to other trusted friends and now with that delicacy that pervaded all his actions he seriously considered the question of resigning the presidency of washington college fearful that he might not be equal to his duties after listening however to the affectionate remonstrances of the faculty and board of trustees who well knew the value of his wisdom in the supervision of the college and the power of his mere presence and example upon the students he resumed his labours with the resolution to remain at his post and carry forward the great work he had so auspiciously begun during the summer he spent some weeks at the hot springs of virginia using the baths and came home seemingly better in health and spirits he entered upon the duties of the opening collegiate year in september with that quiet zeal and noiseless energy that marked all his actions and an unusual elation was felt by those about him at the increased prospect that long years of usefulness and honour would yet be added to his glorious life wednesday september 28 1870 found general lee at the post of duty in the morning he was fully occupied with the correspondence and other tasks incident to his office of president of washington college and he declined offers of assistance from members of the faculty of whose services he sometimes availed himself after dinner at four oclock he attended a vestrymeeting of grace episcopal church the afternoon was chilly and wet and a steady rain had set in which did not cease until it resulted in a great flood the most memorable and destructive in this region for a hundred years the church was rather cold and damp and general lee during the meeting sat in a pew with his military cape cast loosely about him in a conversation that occupied the brief space preceding the call to order he took part and told with marked cheerfulness of manner and kindliness of tone some pleasant anecdotes of bishop meade and chiefjustice marshall the meeting was protracted until after seven oclock by a discussion touching the rebuilding of the church edifice and the increase of the rectors salary general lee acted as chairman and after hearing all that was said gave his own opinion as was his wont briefly and without argument he closed the meeting with a characteristic act the amount required for the ministers salary still lacked a sum much greater than general lees proportion of the subscription in view of his frequent and generous contributions to the church and other charities but just before the adjournment when the treasurer announced the amount of the deficit still remaining general lee said in a low tone i will give that sum he seemed tired toward the close of the meeting and as was afterward remarked showed an unusual flush but at the time no apprehensions were felt general lee returned to his house and finding his family waiting tea for him took his place at the table standing to say grace the effort was valid the lips could not utter the prayer of the heart finding himself unable to speak he took his seat quietly and without agitation his face seemed to some of the anxious group about him to wear a look of sublime resignation and to evince a full knowledge that the hour had come when all the cares and anxieties of his crowded life were at an end his physicians doctors h s barton and r l madison arrived promptly applied the usual remedies and placed him upon the couch from which he was to rise no more to him henceforth the things of this world were as nothing and he bowed with resignation to the command of the master he had followed so long with reverence they symptoms of his attack resembled concussion of the brain without the attendant swoon there was marked debility a slightly impaired consciousness and a tendency to doze but no paralysis of motion or sensation and no evidence of suffering or inflammation of the brain his physicians treated the case as one of venous congestion and with apparently favourable results yet despite these propitious auguries drawn from his physical symptoms in view of the great mental strain he had undergone the gravest fears were felt that the attack was mortal he took without objection the medicines and diet prescribed and was strong enough to turn in bed without aid and to sit up to take nourishment during the earlier days of his illness though inclined to doze he was easily aroused was quite conscious and observant evidently understood whatever was said to him and answered questions briefly but intelligently he was however averse to much speaking generally using monosyllables as had always been his habit when sick when first attacked he said to those who were removing his clothes pointing at the same time to his rheumatic shoulder you hurt my arm although he seemed to be gradually improving until october 10th he apparently knew from the first that the appointed hour had come when he must enter those dark gates that closing open no more on the earth in the words of his physician he neither expected nor desired to recover when general custis lee made some allusion to his recover he shook his head and pointed upward on the monday morning before his death doctor madison finding him looking better tried to cheer him how do you feel today general general lee replied slowly and distinctly i feel better the doctor then said you must make haste and get well traveller has been standing so long in the stable that he needs exercise the general made no reply but slowly shook his head and closed his eyes several times during his illness he put aside his medicine saying it is of no use but yielded patiently to the wishes of his physicians or children as if the slackened chords of being still responded to the touch of duty or affection on october 10th during the afternoon his pulse became feeble and rapid and his breathing hurried with other evidences of great exhaustion about midnight he was seized with a shivering from extreme debility and doctor barton was obliged to announce the danger to the family on october 11th he was evidently sinking his respiration was hurried his pulse feeble and rapid though less observant he still recognised whoever approached him but refused to take anything unless prescribed by his physicians it now became certain that the case was hopeless his decline was rapid yet gentle and soon after nine oclock on the morning of october 12th he closed his eyes and his soul passed peacefully from earth general lees physicians attributed his death in great measure to moral causes the strain of his campaigns the bitterness of defeat aggravated by the bad faith an insolence of the victor sympathy with the subsequent sufferings of the southern people and the effort at calmness under these accumulated sorrows seemed the sufficient and real causes that slowly but steadily undermined his health and led to his death yet to those who saw his composure under the greater and lesser trials of life ad his justice and forbearance with the most unjust and uncharitable it seemed scarcely credible that his serene soul was shaken by the evil that raged around him general lees closing hours were consonant with his noble and disciplined life never was more beautifully displayed how a long and severe education of mind and character enables the soul to pass with equal step through this supreme ordeal never did the habits and qualities of a lifetime solemnly gathered into a few last sad hours more grandly maintain themselves amid the gloom and shadow of approaching death the reticence the selfcontained composure the obedience to proper authority the magnanimity and the christian meekness that marked all his actions still preserved their sway in spite of the inroads of disease and the creeping lethargy that weighted down his faculties as the old hero lay in the darkened room or with the lamp and hearthfire casting shadows upon his calm noble front all the missing grandeur of his form and face and brow remained and death seemed to lose its terrors and to borrow a grace and dignity in sublime keeping with the life that was ebbing away the great mind sank to its last repose almost with the equal poise of health the few broken utterances that evinced at times a wandering intellect were spoken under the influence of the remedies administered but as long as consciousness lasted there was evidence that all the high controlling influences of his whole life still ruled and even when stupor was laying its cold hand on the intellectual perceptions the moral nature with its complete orb of duties and affections still asserted itself a southern poet has celebrated in song these last significant words strike the tent and a thousand voices were raised to give meaning to the uncertain sound when the dying man said with emphasis tell hill he must come up these sentences serve to show most touchingly through what fields the imagination was passing but generally his words though few were coherent but for the most part indeed his silence was unbroken this selfcontained reticence had an awful grandeur in solemn accord with a life that needed no defense deeds which required no justification must speak for him his voiceless lips like the shut gates of some majestic temple were closed not for concealment but because that within was holy could the eye of the mourning watcher have pierced the gloom that gathered about the recesses of that great soul it would have perceived a presence there full of an ineffable glory leaning trustfully upon the allsustaining arm the man whose stature measured by mortal standards seemed so great passed from this world of shadows to the realities of the hereafter a letter from my mother to a dear friend tells the same sad story my husband came in we had been waiting tea for him and i remarked you have kept us waiting a long time where have you been he did not reply but stood up as if to say grace yet no word proceeded from his lips and he sat down in his chair perfectly upright and with a sublime air of resignation on his countenance and did not attempt to a reply to our inquiries that look was never forgotten and i have no doubt he felt that his hour had come for though he submitted to the doctors who were immediately summoned and who had not even reached their homes from the same vestrymeeting yet his whole demeanour during his illness showed one who had taken leave of earth he never smiled and rarely attempted to speak except in dreams and then he wandered to those dreadful battlefields once when agnes urged him to take some medicine which he always did with reluctance he looked at her and said it is no use but afterward he took it when he became so much better the doctor said you must soon get out and ride your favorite gray he shook his head most emphatically and looked upward he slept a great deal but knew us all greeted us with a kindly pressure of the hand and loved to
