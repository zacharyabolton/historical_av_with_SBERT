Ju my garden a lily grew, blossoming in
snowy purity, fragrant sweetness and stately
grace. It held the summer in its golden heart
and the love of the angels crowned its radiant
petals. It bade me "good-morning" and the
dawn was bright with promise. It waved a
caress to me in the soft winds of the Junetide
noon and the day was filled with light and love.
It shone in mystie silver through the moonlight
and my night was aglow with dreams.
Thus a Lily-Soul blooms in the garden of
my life to make it glad with the glory and fragrance of her blossoming. Many hearts are
happy because of the flowers of Love and Hope
and Faith which she has planted. Many a life
which in its early dawn held little promise of
good has grown into usefulness and beauty in
the brightness that the Lily-Soul has given of
her own loveliness to light the dim pathway.
In cloudy days the whiteness of the Lily-Soul
has shone like a star through my darkness and
the sunlight in her golden heart has illumined
the black veil of sorrow.
HERE are some events with which we
have become so familiar by report that
we can scarcely believe they did not happen within our own recollection. Thus it is
with my advent into earthly existence.
Not long before the time at which I was expected to arrive in this vale of thorns and
flowers my father's only brother was seriously
ill, It became necessary for my father to accompany him to Philadelphia to consult an eminent surgeon.
For months it had been definitely settled that
I was to be a boy, for all was grist that came to
my father's mill. No shadow of a doubt of my
manhood clouded the family mind. My health
had been drunk at the clubs and in the homes,
and especially at the neighborhood functions,
the fox hunts, and
h "T'/homme propose et Dieu surprend,"' and so did I, for, most
bids * (Sashes *
Sheps choerag'
unexpectedly, I made my arrival in the middle
of the night, the middle of the week, the middle
of the month, almost the middle of the year,
near the middle of the century, and in the
middle of a hail-storm. Confident that I was a
boy, the family had all hoped that I would be
considerate enough to postpone my coming at
least until my father's return, but with perverse
discourtesy and want of filial regard, I would
not wait. Of course, there was no one ready
to receive me.
I have borne the blame for this untimely
début, but it was really the fault of the barn
which, in the early part of the evening, had
caught fire and been burned to the ground. The
excitement had passed and the sleep of exhaustion that follows disrupting events had settled
over all when again there was confusion; this
time owing to my inconsiderate haste to present
myself. The keys to the stable door could not
be found. There was no time to hunt for them,
so the hinges were pried off and Fannie Kemble,
the fleetest and safest horse in the stable, was
hurriedly called from her dreams. My young
uncle, afterwards a gallant Confederate officer,
Colonel J. J. Phillips, was routed out and, barefoot and mounted upon the horse without saddle
or bridle, rode post haste for our family physician, treasuring the grievance to reproach me
with in after years when I would give evidence
of a too impetuous disposition. In my eagerness to fly to the ills I knew not of, I would not
await the arrival of the medical man and,
spurning his assistance, defying them all, made
my "ingress into life, naked and bare."
"Why didn't you wait for me, you impertinent
little rascal?" inquired the Doctor. "What's
your hurry? You are too enterprising for so
young a lad."
Several days later my father returned and
hurried to my mother. After blessing and kissing her he said proudly:
"Now, little mother, papa wants to see his
little man. Where is he?"
In those days the nearest telegraph station
was a long distance from our plantation home
and there had been no opportunity of informing my father of the misfortune that had befallen the family.
A burst of tears answered him.
"My God! My wife! My boy is not-—not
dead!"
"Oh, my darling, it's worse than that!"
"Worse! He is not deformed!"
"T can't tell you! T—TI couldn't help it."
"Where is he?"
"In there," pointing to the room that had
been arranged for a nursery.
Mammy Charity, who had been eavesdropping, was almost knocked over as my father
suddenly opened the door upon her and excitedly cried:
"Let me see my boy, mammy !"
I opened my eyes which, alas were crossed,
to give and receive a blessing.
"A cross-eyed girl!" he exclaimed. "How
did it happen?"
Three weeks later, when my grandmother
made her second visit to me, her first grandchild, finding that I had developed into a very
colic-y, and consequently, fretful child, a disturber of sleep and peace, she offered to take
me back home with her, a proposition which was eagerly accepted. The "settin'-aig-basket"
was sent for and I was comfortably and cosily
placed in it and put into the foot of her rock-
away. Pery, the driver, was cautioned to be
It was a beautiful day in June. 'The air was
laden with perfume and song. Not that I knew
it at the time—cuddled up in my "settin'-aig-
hasket"—~but I have credible information on the
subject, furnished later, with all the rest of the
details of that most important, though unconscious, period of my earthly career. Every
little while my grandmother would peep into
the basket to see that all was well. Everybody
we met stopped to ask after the "new-born
baby" and, being informed of its presence in
the "settin'-aig-basket,' requested to make its
acquaintance sans ceremony, Pery taking advantage of the introduction to hop out of the
rockaway and gather great green honeysuckles
and honeysuckle blossoms, which he put into
the basket until it looked as if filled with honeysuckles and their blooms, that being the best
tribute he could offer to the little new "missis."
At Sandy Bottom, the dismal grave of many
a trusting heart, where the frog croaks his never-ceasing croon, Uncle Frenigike came out
from "Free-nigger-town" to borrow "a chew of
terbaeker" and beg a "ninepence to buy de ole
man a plug." Recognizing the "settin'-aig-
basket" he said:
Being informed of the contents of the basket,
he asked to be allowed to see "de li'l gal baby."

"
Suiting the action to the word, he worked his
own black forefinger within my little soft baby
clasp, then suddenly but gently withdrawing it
asked :
But for the superstitious and fascinating
tales, silken-woven by the tongue of fancy, and
the awesome shadows cast by authenticated
tragedies, Sandy Bottom, where I met my sable
godfather, Frenigike, and received my first security against ill luck, would have been nothing
but an insignificant little valley in the wild-wood, crossed by a quiet looking stream. In its
dread death-bed, by the side of priests and Indians, fair-haired maidens and dark-eyed savages, sleep the wife and children and servants
of an English nobleman. The infant child, because of its appealing helplessness, alone was
saved, while the great strong horses and the
coach with its freight of human lives, gold and
silver and jewels, were swallowed by the treacherous quicksand.
This tragedy occurred in the year 1799, when
Sir Henry Clinton formed the plan of humbling
the pride and destroying the resources of Virginia. He sent a powerful fleet to Hampton
Roads and landed a foree under General
Mathews to advance and perfect this project.
General Mathews took possession of Norfolk
and Portsmouth and the surrounding country,
burning Suffolk and committing depredations
everywhere. The family of an English nobleman, frightened by the devastation, fled for
safety to a point on the Nansemond where apart of the English fleet was lying in waiting.
Passing Sandy Bottom the driver stopped to
water his horses. He was urging them farther
up stream where the water was deeper and
clearer, when a runaway negro named Isaac
sprang from the bank, shrieking out a warning
of the terrible quicksand. Wis warning being
disregarded, he snatched the sleeping baby from
the nurse's arms, saying:
Before the last echo had followed the negro'swords-—before the frightened child could catch
breath for another shriek—carriage, horses,
driver, footmen, maids, children and mistress
were all sucked in by the dark water. A few
bubbles here and there were the only sign of its
treachery. The horrified riders had followed so
close that the dash of their horses' feet splashed
the water simultaneously on the screaming child
and over the swirling waves which marked the
fatal spot of its mother's doom.
As a reward for his warning and for saving
the life of the child, Isaac, the negro, was given
his liberty and a home—the first of his race ever
set free in Virginia~-and was thereafter impressively distinguished by the (to those of his
own color) opprobrious epithet of "Free-Negro-
Isaac." This name was soon jargoned into
Frenigike, and afterward, through culture and
prosperity, into Freeling, the present family
name of the descendants of Frenigike. The old
place near Sandy Bottom is still called Free-
Nigger-Town. TILL huddled among the honeysuckles in
the basket I was carefully lifted from the
carriage.
My grandmother, who not only liked to humor
her servants but enjoyed the anticipated surprise he was going to give Mammy Dilsey,
granted Pery's request and I was carried in
and put upon Mammy's bed and the rehearsed
conversation followed. Mammy Dilsey would
have been more vigorous in her denunciation
of that "fryin'-size' with his "lyin' en pro-
jickin'" if her eyes had not at that moment
rested on my grandmother, to whom she appealed to "help her to save dat lyin'-limb-of-a-
nigger fum perditionment."
''Look for yourself, Mammy Dilsey, before
condemning Pery to perdition," suggested my
grandmother.
Mammy looked and seeing only my leafy and
blossoming cover, ejaculated scornfully :
In lifting my honeysuckle blanket she pulled
out my sugar rag. This loss combined with
the cessation of the soothing motion of the rock-
away caused me to make my presence and my
grievances known by wail after wail, verifying
Pery's truthfulness as to something having
hatched out.
At this moment the door opened and Aunt
Serena, who had already been notified of her
coming duties, appeared, carrying on each arm
a baby as black as the ace of spades. Without a
word she laid both the babies down on Mammy
Dilsey's bed and, taking me in her loving,
motherly arms, set my table, and I, half starved,
ravenously showed my appreciation and enjoyed my first meal at the expense of my little foster sisters, who had just been awakened by
my screams.
The news of my strange arrival had spread
and the whole plantation assembled to see their
''voung missis,'' crowding around in reverential
admiration, while I went off into a peaceful
sleep, smiling anon in that sleep, as the warmhearted loyal negroes, from the oldest to the
youngest, leaned over to look at and bless me,
issus'es" first grandchild.
The cradle was brought down from the garret and emptied of its loyal little toys. It had
belonged to the twin-brother of the uncle who
took the midnight ride to help me across the
dark waters. While it was being arranged for
my occupancy a cry of dismay went up from
Ole-Granny-Aggie, who had disobeyed Uncle
Charles and followed me in.
The superstitions were heeded, the little toys
were all lovingly replaced in the cradle and returned to the garret and I was put to sleep in
the little trundle bed where my grandfather
and great-grandfather and mother and uncles
and aunts had slept when the cradle and crib
had grown too small and they were not yet old
enough for a tester-bed.
Aunt Serena was moved from the "quarters"
and ensconced in one of the garret rooms of the
"Gre't House." She was provided with a supply of new clothing, which delighted her, and
was placed upon a special diet, which she resented, preferring her bacon and greens, ''pot-
liquor" and "corn-meal-dumplin's" to the daintier food prescribed.
Her little twins, my foster sisters, Mary-
Frances and Arabella, were placed in the care
of the "orphan tenders," Mammy Duilsey and
Ole-Granny-Aggie, the latter claiming to be
more than a hundred years old. A cow was set
aside for the especial use of the twins, who
soon learned that the tinkle of the cow-bells
meant for them a banquet of rich warm milk.
For awhile they were brought up twice a day
to the "Gre't House" to see "dar Mammy" and
sometimes were permitted to partake of the
crumbs that fell from the "rich baby's table,"
which crumbs they soon disdainfully refused,
showing their preference for the libations of
"Spotty Sookey,"' that being the name of their
barnyard cow.Y grandmother's old colonial home,
Holiday's Point, so-called because of
the many holidays that my grandfather
had been accustomed to give his servants, was
on the Nansemond River, in Nansemond chant
The county came into existence in 1639, being
first called Upper Norfolk. Its name was soon
_. changed to Nansemum, spelled by Captain John
Car ET The Dismal Swamp ex-
ends along its edge. Its county-seat is Suffolk, the burning of which I, as a child, have
often heard described by Ole-Granny-Aggie,
an eye-witness, while we would listen with bated
breath, hair on end and nerves aquiver.
"No, chillun," she would say,
Then she would describe in her picturesque
lingo the firing of the barrels of tar, pitch and
turpentine which had been brought from the
Dismal Swamp and placed upon the wharf
awaiting shipping. The flames carried by a
strong wind caught the grass of the dry marshes
and spread to the town and the surrounding
country and, as Granny-Aggie said,
"Of course," she replied. "She is a very
nice little girl. What makes you ask?"
"Because her pa and ma rent their home.
She told me so herself. She can't be respectable."
My grandmother explained to me that though
it was pleasant and desirable to live in the house
of our fathers, the absence of that comfort did
not necessarily place a person "beyond the pale."
But I felt at that time that it was grandmother's
charity that caused her to set forth that view,
for I thought that people who did not live in
their own houses could not be respectable.
Two members of my grandmother's household were "nominated" as "church visitors,"
Mrs. Mary Hutchins, who was deaf, and whose
husband, a sea captain, had been lost in a wreck,
and Miss Sophia Wilson who, through a vicious
parrot, had lost her sight on the eve of her
marriage and had, in consequence, been deserted by her fiancé.
There were poorhouses in those days but
no homes for aged women and the members of
the church took care of their homeless coworkers. As Mrs. Hutchins and Miss Sophia belonged to the old Glebe Church, they were
invited as honored guests by fellow-members.
Some years earlier the Episcopal Church had
become almost extinct in Virginia and the membership was still very small, so that the visits
were correspondingly extended. As my grandmother's home was especially pleasant the
guests prolonged their stay indefinitely, suddenly falling too ill to be moved if there was
any suggestion of their going elsewhere.
Mrs. Hutchins, or "Miss Mary," as we called
her, could not hear, but she read the movements
of the lips, a circumstance of which Miss Sophia
would perversely take advantage by turning
away as she spoke, whereupon her friend would
thus reproach her:
"Turn your head this way, Sophia Wilson!
You don't want me to hear what you are talking
about. Begrudging me a little news and I interested in everything, and the Lord knows I
haven't a bit of curiosity."
"How do you know what the Lord knows,
Mary Hutchins? If you knew half what He
knows you wouldn't make so many mistakes.
No curiosity, indeed! You're chock full of it.
You'd bore a gimlet hole through the earth to
see what was on the other side."
"You wouldn't know what was on the other
side if there was a tunnel through and somebody shouting it with a fog-horn, and yow're so stingy
you wouldn't tell me if you did know. Not that
it makes any difference; you're not likely to
known anything on any side of the earth."
"Humph," was the indignant retort, "if I
don't know things why should you be so anxious
to see me talk so you could find them out."
''Miss Mary'? was saved from the embarrassment of a reply by the timely arrival of my
grandmother, who could always apply oil to
the waters when they were especially troubled.
Well, Mary Hutchins!" exclaimed Miss
Sophia in stern disapproval when I would be
lost in rapt attention to these thrilling tales.
"What do you mean by putting such notions into that innocent child's head? What do you
suppose she will come to when she grows up?
A lunatic asylum? Come out of one yourself
most likely or you wouldn't get such crazy ideas.
Just fancy people wearing other people's heads
and hanging them on the wall when they can
pick up beautiful shell necklaces right off their
own beach and can get wax flowers to put
around their houses that look natural and won't
ever fade! And as for sea-serpents, you know
there never were any."
"Now, Sophia Wilson," Mrs. Hutchins would
answer, ''the Bible tells us that there are more
things in heaven and earth than philosophy ever
dreamt of, and we know it's true, and if philosophy can't even dream of the things in heaven
and earth, how in the name of common sense
are you going to know what's in the waters
under the earth? And doesn't it stand to reason that those who go down into the great deep
know more about what's in the sea-waves than
you do who would be afraid of the wave of a
clothes-line on a wash-day?"
In romantic moments Mrs. Hutehins would
tell me of the green-haired, flame-eyed, melodious-voiced mermaids that lie in wait to lure
unwary seamen to destruction on the rocks,
from which danger her sailor had been delivered
by the memory of her. Unfortunately, Miss Sophia chanced to be present at one of these
sentimental reminiscences.
You never did have green hair, Ma
futchins, not even at your prettiest, and that
wouldn't be much, and as for flaming eyes, you
couldn't scorch a potato, not if your dinner depended on it, and if you ever did sing it must
have been worse than a flock of jaybirds. Talk
about that old Greek who moved trees when
he played! I should think your singing would
be enough to make all the woodpiles in Virginia
run away. The more you educate that child,
Mary Hutchins, the less she knows. The Lord
gave her more learning to begin with than
she']l ever get from you, and if you go on telling her such trash she'll forget all she ever did
know. I heard you yesterday telling her about
the ghosts of the children of Israel that keep
on crossing the Red Sea. Now I want you to
know, Mary Hutchins, that when those Jews
crossed the Red Sea once they were on the other
side for good and they don't go on walking
through that water as if the Lord had nothing
to do but take care of them every time they
chose to go wading. There is such a thing as
trusting the Lord once too often, and the folks
that know Him as well as the children of Israel
did aren't going to take risks like that on Him.
First thing you know you'll have that child seeing ghosts, and you know well enough that people who see ghosts aren't ever likely to see anything that's worth looking at."
T was often troubled in my mind between a
confidence in ''Miss Mary,''? which I wished to
preserve unshaken, and the force of Miss
Sophia's arguments.
The germ of pathos latent in my undeveloped
mind was fostered by the story of Miss Sophia's
lost vision, which ran thus:
She was visiting at the home of a friend who
owned a parrot of unusual brightness of mind
and independence of character. Its mistress
had a little wooden whistle like those you may
recall having seen rural schoolboys whittle out
and use for the production of music somewhat
shrill in tone but well adapted to please the
taste of the juvenile artist. The lady would
whistle to the bird, which would answer her intones that obviously fell short of its ambition.
The mistress had a whistle like her own made
for the parrot who, marvelous to relate, acquired a high degree of skill in its use and was
proud of the achievement.
Once when Miss Sophia's fiancé called she
wished to entertain him with a display of the
bird's accomplishments. Putting her friend's
whistle to her lips she approached the cage.
The parrot, apparently angry with the usurper daring to assume the character of its mistress, darted its beak through the wires and
plucked out one of the interloper's eyes. From
overwork or sympathy the other eye lost its
sight. The lover's affection failed before the
test of a blind sweetheart and he found a more
fortunate lady.
This story was told me as a lesson in refraining from meddling with the possessions of other
people. In combination with '"Meddlesome
Matty" in my school reader it led me to extreme
care in avoiding too great familiarity with
things that did not belong to me.
I was fascinated not only -by the tragic story
but by the click-clack of Miss Sophia's teeth
falling out of place as she told it to me. She
had purchased them by the sacrifice of her collection of gold dollars, the gifts of friends
through many years. The extravagance and
vanity of this purchase furnished another subject of dispute with "Miss Mary," who was a
thrifty soul and pious as well.
"Sophia Wilson," she said, "if the Lord had
intended you to have teeth all your life wouldn't
He have given you a set that would have lasted
to your dying day?"
Miss Sophia retorted with spirit:
"If He wanted me to go without teeth because the ones He made turned out badly, why
do you suppose He put people into the world
that were smart enough to make new ones?
Just answer me that!"
The question being wholly unanswerable, the
conversation lapsed.
I found relief from the depression produced
by the tragic reminiscences confided to me by
going out into the sunlight on the grass-carpeted
lawn and walking under the pink and white
canopy of the blossoming Althea bushes, or Rose
of Sharon, as the flowering plant was sometimes
called. The negroes had named the Althea the
"toothbrush tree" because they broke twigs
from it and chewed the ends of the tough fiber
into brushes softer than the finest hair brush
and used them for cleaning their teeth. 'Miss
Rose Sharon she first started it,' they said.
'She was a fairy and lived in the tree and the
pink and white blossoms are the smile of her
pretty face.'' I thought the fairy magic in the
"tooth-brush tree" was what kept the teeth of
the negroes so dazzlingly white, and we children
always made our toothbrushes of the same material, hoping to achieve a like result.
On the plantation were some "Story Trees,"
or "Ghost Trees," as the negroes called them.
On their trunks were patches of white and gray
moss, like fragments of thin veils. Each of the
splotches bore a warning or a legend 'brought by the spirits and written there. The trees
were centuries old and held the ancient Bible
stories recorded before the alphabet was invented, when the art of reading was among the
undiscovered things, and not even the earliest
picture-writing had been evolved. It was only
the most important messages that the Lord
would permit to be confided to the old trees.
Some of the spirit records had broken lines
and the servants said that the angel's wing was
broken as he brought the message down. There
was a deep and fearsome scar on one of the
"host trees" which indicated a tragedy, pastor to come, and I used to gaze upon it with awesome wonder, trying to read its dread meaning.
A few years later a great tragedy came and
the blackness of it shrouded our whole nation,
but whether that was what the old tree prophecy
meant I know not. EVERYONE has a point of beginning—a
period back of which life, to present consciousness, was not. For me this point
stands out vividly in memory.
I was staying with my grandmother, for since
she took me home in the "settin'-aig-basket,"
she had lovingly asserted her claim. My time
was divided between the two homes, hers and
my father's. My tall handsome father and my
beautiful little mother sat on the front veranda,
my brother Thomas playing near them on the
grass. It was in cherry time and I saw "Uncle
Charles" coming up the slope carrying a forked
stick on which hung a great cluster of black-
heart cherries edged with bright red ones that
he had gathered for them to take home.
Suddenly my attention was diverted from
the cherries to a horse pounding down the Jane
and stopping at the gate, where a barefoot boy
tumbled off. He had ridden bareback, with
plow-hames for a bridle, as if the horse had
been hastily taken from the field.
"Come quick as you can, please, ma'am!"
cried the boy. "Mrs. Pitt is dying!"
The rockaway was drawn to the door by old
Starlight, my grandmother took her seat within, and I watched Pery driving off, following
them with my eyes to the end of the lane, where
they were lost to view in the highway.
Poor Mrs. Pitt left four children to be apportioned among the members of her church,
little Sara falling to my grandmother's care.
The next morning my old mammy broke this
news to me, ending with:
My mammy's idea of the Episcopal Church
dated from the days when its members were
noted for ornamentation in dress, and to her it
was always "de silk-stockin' Chu'ch." The lack
of silken qualifications did not lessen her determination to do her duty by the little girl
who, in her opinion, was so frail that she was
doomed to an early death. In her desire to
fulfill her obligations mammy exhorted me to
She expressed her opinion that it was not for nothing
that she had been dreaming about snakes and
about wasps building their nests in the beehives and made gloomy predictions of "haunts"
and spirits that would prowl around and creep
through the keyholes because of this unfortunate child. Warned by my wondering eyes
that she was trespassing on forbidden ground,
she stopped short, saying:
The privilege of playing with my dear little
set of imported china was granted only when
I had been particularly good or some one else
particularly indiscreet.
That evening little "Sary Lizbef" came. She
was a shy, frail, bow-legged child, with sandy
hair, pale blue eyes, and warts on her fingers.
I took possession of her, wanting to give her
everything I had, happy in my self-abnegation,
having a tender feeling for her because of her
lack of the vigor possessed by the other children
I knew and because there gloomed over me
mammy's assertion, "She's 'bleeged to die, anyhow."
One morning Aunt Serena came i
known to my grandmother her suspicions that
the little girl had whooping cough, adding theWwW
Noe
warning:
The diagnosis proving correct,
my grandmother stopped our "mingulatin' " by
taking me to Old Point Comfort to visit her
friend, Mrs. Boykin, a sister of Mr. John Y.
Mason. At first I was troubled about my only
girl playmate; white girl, I mean, for Mary
Frances and Arabella, my little colored foster
sisters, had been my maids and playmates
all my life and I was strongly attached to them,
like a princess dispensing laws and giving them
their parts to play in the drama of child-life.
Only a Southern child can understand these relations and the sentiments born of them.
The charms of Old Point soon dispelled my
grief and I was happy, being a favorite not
only with the children but with the older guests,
who found me useful in amusing the little ones,
to whom I taught the fancy steps I had learned
from my dancing-master and the original songs
and dances of the negroes on the plantation.
Alas! in due course of time I developed whooping cough and was thrust into the gulf of social
ostracism. Instead of the accustomed hearty
welcome, I was greeted with, "Run away, little
girl, my little children cannot play with you
now." T was a sensitive child, and this sudden
change was like a January freeze in midsummer, but I soon discovered that my mammy's
advice,
strictly followed, insured contentment in the long run. She pointed out the
advantage of being sociable with myself, in that
I should have no interference from others, but
warned me to be careful not to play too long
at one game or I would surely have 'one of
dem tur'ble low-sperited spells yo' gramma ealls
'on yo' ear,' " the latter phrase being mammy's
version of "ennui."
Before I had reached this danger-point fateh
brought me a companion who more than filled
the vacancy left by the defection of my former
playmates. I had seen a solitary officer on the
sands, reading, or looking at the ships as they
came and went, or watching the waves as they
dashed to sudden death against the shore. He
figured in my imagination as the "Good Prince"
in the fairy stories my grandmother told me.
He did not look as tall as the men of my family, but he carried himself so erectly and walked
with such soldierly dignity that I was sure that
any "Good Prince" might have envied him his
stately appearance. I noted that his hair, which
hung in shining waves almost to his shoulders,
was the same color as my own and I pulled one
of my curls around to look at it and make sure
of the accuracy of the comparison. Even at that early age I had a liking for dainty hands and
feet and I noticed his small feet as he paced the
sands and the delicate hand that was raised
to his cap in salute to an officer who passed.
The grace of his hands was well set off by the
fabric ruffles that edged his sleeves. My
childish eyes took in the neatness and perfect
fit of his attire which set off his distinguished
form. J thought him quite the handsomest soldier I had ever seen, and was surprised one day
to hear somebody say that he had fought in the
Mexican war. It seemed impossible to me.
How could anyone so immaculate and so beautiful to look upon have really fought and killed
people? I had never been near enough to see
his eyes, but imagined that they must be brilliant stars like those to which I said good-night
just before I cuddled down to invite sweet
dreams.
My attention would probably not have been
drawn so particularly to my soldier, for I had
already begun to call him my soldier, had he
been surrounded by dancing, chattering companions and formed a part of the gay life of
Old Point Comfort. I should have observed
him only as a brilliant feature of the cruel world
that had chosen to condemn me to exile. But
in his solitude I felt that we were comrades in
sad experience. J knew of only one calamity that could so set apart a human being from his
fellow creatures as to bar him from association
with his kind. The symptoms were unmistakable and I at once recognized the melancholy
officer as a co-victim of whooping cough and
gave him the tender pity of one who knew all
about his misfortune.
One morning I was skipping along, chattering as usual, inquiring about the little girl
whose spiteful tongue had been pulled out by
a springbok, asking if the bluejay really did
carry tales to the devil, and other queries pertinent to my stage of development, when my
grandmother stopped to speak to a friend. I
rambled on until I came to a spreading umbrella
under which my soldier lay on the sands reading. He was so absorbed in his book that he
did not see me till I crawled under the umbrella
and looked into his face with, I suppose, all the
sympathy that I felt and asked him anxiously
if he had the whooping cough, telling him of
my mammy's infallible remedy for that malady
and assuring him of her willingness to apply it
to his case. Then he looked at me, courteously
raising his cap and smiling, and I saw that his
eyes were gray, shot with changeful lights,
twinkling blue with mirthfulness as he gave me
a polite good morning. This recalled me to a
realization of the demands of good society and I got up and curtsied, wishing him "Good morning" and inquiring concerning his health. He
arose and with knightly grace returned my
greeting, pointing to a seat for me on the sand,
and resumed his own place. Returning to the
query with which I had opened the interview
he asked why I had taken him for a victim of
so Juvenile an ailment. I feelingly related my
own experience and dwelt upon the oppressive
isolation of one so afflicted and said that as he
did not associate with other officers nor dance
with young ladies and had to swim and read
all by himself, as I did, I thought it must be
because he was suffering from the same misfortune as that which had deprived me of social
pleasures.
He looked at me with a shade of sadness in
his face and then I saw that his eves could be
very dark, like the sky sometimes at night when
the moon had gone to bed and the stars were
only little shimmery specks of light in the darkness piled velvety soft. He told me that he did
not have the whooping cough but he had something worse, a broken heart, and he did not
like to make others sad with his sorrow.
J had never seen a broken heart, but had some
acquaintance with articles that had come to
grief in the kitchen and had been restored to
pristine wholeness by clever manipulation. I comforted him with the assurance that broken
hearts did not signify anything of importance;
my mammy could mend them with glue and
boil them in milk so you couldn't even see the
cracks in them, as she had done with my grandmother's sugar bow.
He took a ring from his guard-chain and put
it on my finger and gave me a tiny gold heart
inscribed with "Sally," which had been the name
of one of his loved ones, and I crept out from
under the umbrella pledged to Lieutenant
George HE. Pickett of the United States Army.
Then and to the end he was my soldier, and
always when we were alone I called him "Soldier." I still have the ring and heart, and am
indebted for this reminiscence to the little red
memorandum book which he gave me years
after, when he was General George E. Pickett,
of the Confederate Army.
"Come again, little fairy," he said as I was
leaving him to the uninterrupted perusal of his
book. Just then my grandmother came up, with
apologies for my intrusion upon a stranger, and
the explanation that my nurse had been sent
to the Fort with a note for Lieutenant Pickett,
the son of one of her old friends, asking the
pleasure of his company to dinner. My newfound friend introduced himself as the officer
in «question, expressing his pleasure in the meeting and assuring her that my visit had been a
charming episode in a monotonous waste of
loneliness. I explained:
"Yes, it has all been arranged," he laughed.
From that time loneliness was at an end for
me. My soldier had no fear of contagion, assuring me when I asked him if he was too big
to have whooping cough that it was a privilege
of youth and diminutiveness. We built pine
bark yachts and sailboats and steamers and
sailed them on the lakes we made by damming
up the waves that dashed highest on the
shore. The waves of our lakes washed the
coasts of every country on the map and our
stately ships brought back to us rich cargoes
from all the countries of the world. We built
forts and garrisoned them with men as brave as
those who fell with Leonidas in the great battle
of which my soldier told me as we worked.Upon the sea-wall he placed a flag that fluttered
defiance to the enemy-ocean as the waves dashed
up to our embattled ramparts and rolled back
defeated. It was my first introduction to the
Star-Spangled Banner and the red and white
stripes and star-gemmed sky impressed me as
very beautiful, Ai thosesdaysetheStars~and. 5 aLes aecdie ht-
When I was wearied with the toil incident to
our extensive commercial operations and the
labors and anxieties of battle we sat upon the
sand and he sang to me, playing the accompaniments on his guitar. When I hear those old
songs to-day they come to me with the far faint
odor of the breezes that swept across the ocean
in that long gone time and I hear again the
golden notes of that melodious voice mingled
with the soft music floating out from the touch
of his fingers.
Three years"
from her prow floated a flag like that
which had waved over the fort we built on the
sands in that time when life had lost all its
troubles and the sunshine of the heart filled
earth and sea and sky with radiance. I felt
then as I had not before realized that this was
my soldier's flag to which his life was given and
to my view the stars in it shone with a new
glory.
The St. Louis was bound for Puget Sound
where was the new station, Fort Bellingham,
which I thought must be farther than the end
of the world. Not one ship of our whole great
fleet in the olden days had sailed for Puget
Sound.HEN we went home Uncle Charles
came to the wharf to meet us. He
was dressed in the clothes left to him
by my grandfather's will and, dangling from
his watch-chain, glaring at us in bold relief
against his black velvet vest, a set of artificial
teeth grinned in ghastly manner from their
gold settings. In those days artificial teeth
were not common, and when Mr. Durkee, a dentist from Connecticut, came into our neighborhood and hung out his sign, all of a certain
class who could raise money enough had their
teeth taken out and replaced by false ones.
That year when my grandmother asked
Uncle Charles what he would like for a Christmas present he chose "a p'ar of dem sto' teef,"
explaining that his were "moughty nigh wo' out,
chawin' 'backer en a gnashin' de mules of a
week days en de sinners of a Sundays."
My grandmother reasoned with him on the
folly of making the exchange but he had set his
heart upon it and she, with her habit of spoiling her servants by indulging them, permitted
him to be measured and fitted for his "sto' teef,"
of which he was so proud that he wore them
more for ornament than use, displaying them
at all special functions.
As Uncle Charles drove us home he had
many confidences to make to my grandmother.
The most important was about little Sara
Elizabeth.
Little Sara, the bone of contention between
the two, as Uncle Charles said, proved in a fairway to be spoiled. On my return she looked
upon me as an intruder, but when she was made
to feel that her rights were not to be infringed
upon she welcomed me into the old companionship. I took great comfort in her, but often
(though I kept the secret in my heart) the unguarded words of my mammy, "dat chile bleeged
fer ter die anyhow," occurred to me and madeine sorry and afraid, yet I knew not why, for I
had no idea of death.
One night I was awakened by the sound of
voices and, peeping from under the covers, saw
the bald head of our old family physician, Dr.
Finney, and the anxious face of my grandmother, who was holding the big brass nursery
candlestick. I caught the word "croup." Then
their voices were lowered to a whisper as they
looked toward my bed. They went out and
closed the door and I lay awake a longtime thinking, wondering who or what was
"Croup. +
Next morning I awakened long after my usual
hour and was told that I must be very quiet for
my grandmother had a headache. While my
mammy was dressing me she sighed and looked
mysteriously wise, and between the fastening
of my buttons and the curling of my hair repeated over and over again, "Lord a massy onus! We're here to-day but gone to-morrow!"
As I was tiptoeing down the hall my grandmother called me. She was sitting in her
wrapper before a corn-cob fire. Taking me
upon her lap and rocking me she tenderly
stroked my hair. Mammy, shaking her head,
leaned against the mantel and moaned and
groaned, T turned away and looked into the
crackling fire till presently the beautiful pictures in the burning coals made me break the
solemn silence, and I said:
"Look, grandmother! See! <A ship of coals
loaded with falling stars and Jack-er-my-lanterns. Oh, and see! There is a city of gold!
See that old castle tumbling down. See the
silver cloud going so fast to the city and white
flowers and sunshine all falling down and——"
"Yes, I see, my darling,' replied my grandmother, pressing me closely to her.
objected my mammy, throwing on an armful
of fresh cobs and destroying my golden glory
pictures.
"Now, go along, darling, and eat your breakfast," said my grandmother, "and then you
may tell Ole-Granny-Aggie that she may let you
go into the weaving room and give you the old
cards and some of the waste wool to card, and
if you are very good she may let you run the
shuttle awhile.
I stopped for a minute and looking up at her
said, "And little Sara, too, please, marm?""
She shook her head and shivered; then mammy
took me away.
It was always enchanting to watch Ole-Granny-Aggie weave, but to be allowed to sit
at the loom and slide the shuttle through with
my own hands was a special rapture. Yet this
day I did not enjoy it, for I felt that something
unusual had happened and associated it with
my little friend.
The next morning mammy got out my new
silk reins and hitched up Mary Frances and
Arabella, my "match of blacks," for me to drive,
and as we returned after a long race I saw an
old gentleman with bent back carrying a beautiful white box into the house.
"Oh, how pretty! What is it for?" I asked
my grandmother.
"A little jewel casket, my darling, to hold a
keepsake that I am going to send to the angels.
There, there; run along now and play."
I went into the garden where our own little
bed of white violets was in full bloom, and suddenly remembering with a pang that my little
Sara had wanted to gather them all and that I
would let her have only what I saw fit she
should have, I said, "She shall have every one
now," and gathering my apron almost full Iran into the house.
The door of the room which had been closed
to me for two days had been accidentally left
ajar and, hearing my grandmother's voice, Iran in.She and poor Miss Sophia and "Miss Mary"
and several of the neighbors and servants were
standing around that little white casket resting on a table in the center of the room.
"Is the keepsake in it?" I asked.
My grandmother hefted me up and there,
sweetly sleeping, was my little Sara Elizabeth.
I whispered my wish to put the violets into
her lap so that she could see them the first
thing when she awakened and know that I was
sorry and had brought her both our shares.
My grandmother held me while I gently, and
with no word, lest I should awaken her, put
my violets into her arms so as to "s'prise her
when she waked." Then I whispered to my
grandmother as she carried me away, "Do
angels want little children for keepsakes?"NE of the enchantments of my childhood
was the old cabin in the vale at the entrance to the grounds of the mansion
house at Holiday's Point, where the gatekeeper, Uncle Bosun Keeling, and his wife, Aunt
Charity, lived. I used to run down the cypress-
bordered path to the old lodge to hear him tell
"dem Bible-tales' and to see Aunt Charity's
shining black face surmounted by her flaming
red "haid-hankcher,"' a combination artistic and
beautiful. She would take me on her lap and
tell the old legends that had come down through
generations of dusky story-tellers.
"Yas, honey," she would say, telling me one
of the five versions of the origin of her race,
When Aunt Charity would tell these old Legends Uncle Bosun would sit spell bound as if it
were the first time he had ever heard them and
when she would finish he would shake bis head
with pride and say:
He was a very pious old man, cherishing extreme reverence for the works of God, with
small respect for the innovations of man.
When Doctor Durkee, the "tooth doctor,' appeared in the neighborhood Uncle Bosun's rigid
principles arose in opposition. He looked with both scorn and fear upon the glistening teeth
that were the pride of Uncle Charles's heart—
and plead with him
This frivolous reasoning was contemptuously
set aside by the logical mind of Uncle Bosun,
and Later when Dr. Durkee committed various
thefts and took his departure in undignified
haste, my father asked the gate-keeper how he
knew that the doctor was a rascal.
Uncle Bosun claimed royal blood, having descended from Uncle Jack, the son of a king,
who was brought over from Africa in the last
slaveship that deposited its cargo at Old Osborne on the James River. We loved to hear
him tell of his royal ancestor.
Uncle Bosun told us how the preachers of all
denominations, though they were half-starved
in those days, had joined together and bought
Uncle Jack from his owners and given him his
freedom. He was not only good but brave and
always spoke his mind without fear, telling the
negroes when they would shout at revival meetings that it was scandalous for them to make
so much fuss about such a calm and serious
thing as religion, that they put him in mind
of the little brooks after a rain, soon full, then
noisy, roaring and rushing, then just as soon
empty again. He asked them to try to be more
dignified with their religion and more like the
great, broad, deep river, for he said he had
noticed that the more ignorant folks were, the
more shallow their religion was, and the more
noise they made over it, just like the dry and
no account leaves, he said, that always make
more noise when the wind blows through them
than the green ones do.
A rich man, Mr. Haxall, owner of Haxall's
mills—the mills that made the only flour in the
United States in those days that could be carried across the ocean without spoiling—had,
like many gentlemen of that time, a habit of
profanity. One day when he was swearing
Uncle Jack asked if he wouldn't please, being
a rich and mighty man, set an example to
the world and quit swearing. Mr. Haxall replied:
"Jack, old man, what for? I'm very well
satisfied with myself as I am. I don't know
what more I want than I have. In fact, as far
as I can see, Jack, 'm just as well off as any
of you Christians."
Mr. Haxall, leaning on his cane, walked up
and down the floor and then stopped in front
of Uncle Jack and said:
"Well, old man, what you say is all true
and after this I am going to look up to the
tree."
AMONG my childish recollections is an intricate combination of great-grandfathers, white mulberries, gold dollars, alone eye, guinea eggs, pipes, and bloody massacres, all centering around a visit from my
own great-grandfather, Dr. John Phillips, and
his friend, Judge John Y. Mason.
"Somebody's comin' down de lane en it's ole
Marser, kase I knows him by his high-top gig
en his star-face critter," called out a little colored boy, George Washington Cesar Napoleon
Bonaparte, whose keen eyes had caught sight
of an approaching gig. "Dar's anudder gem-
man alongside of him en anudder li'! boy settin'
in de foots of de gig."
By the time the visitors were at the gate,
heralded by the barking dogs and the little colored children calling "II-y-e-r comes ole Marser,
h-y-e-r comes ole Marser!" the whole family had
assembled on the veranda to welcome the guests.
The first to alight was a graceful, courtly old
man with the bearing of a soldier—my great-
grandfather. The artificial eye which had
taken the place of one of those provided by
Nature was a badge of heroism, reminiscent of
the war of 1812. After affectionate greetings
from children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, servants and dogs, he held out his hands
to his companion and assisted him to alight.
"This," he said, "is my young friend, Judge
John Y,. Mason, whom you know."
From my great-grandfather's point of view,
Judge Mason may have been youthful, but from
mine he was of great age, less venerable than
his friend and companion only because he lacked
the distinguishing title of patriarchal relationship, and looked out upon the world, like ordinary people, through two eyes.
"And this," he said, jumping the little hoy
out, "is my still younger friend, Ned Drewry,
whose family you know."
Then began the unpacking of the gig-box,
which we eagerly watched. I remember being
especially interested in a bucket of white mulberries and a basket of guinea eggs.
Later, as a reward for reciting "Little Drops
of Water," I received a shiny gold dollar, one
of the first minted.
When I hear the lament of to-day, that there
is no money in poetry, I recall my early lesson
to the contrary. My first effort having been so
successful I gave "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star" as a voluntary, in the mercenary hope
that the twinkles, like the drops, might be
transmuted into gold. After curtseying to my
great-grandfather my thanks for the dollar Iran across the room and, looking inquiringly at
Judge Mason, asked:
"Are you anybody's great-grandfather? No,
'course you couldn't because you've got two
eyes,"
As my own great-grandfather was the only
relation of that rank whom I had ever seen, it
had been borne in upon my mind that a single
eye was the distinguishing characteristic of great-grandfathers.
Judge Mason's manner of smoking next attracted my attention. J had never seen a pipe
used except by the negroes on the plantation.
"Did you run off and play with the little colored children and not mind your black mammy
and learn bad habits when you were a little boy
is the reason you smoke pipes now?"
"No," he replied. "I never learned any bad
habits from the negroes. They have very few
bad habits. All the bad habits I have ever
learned were from white people."
Knocking the ashes out of his pipe he said:
"My child, when great-grandfathers were
little babies this—" taking out his tobacco-bag
and filling his pipe from it—'was the only real
money in this country and was of greater value
than the kind which you now hold in your little
hand."
Then he went on to tell me in words that a
child could understand that money debts were
not even recoverable. Tobacco debts only were
valid, and to sell bad tobacco or pay a debt with
it was a crime, precisely as it is now to sell or
pay counterfeit money. Tobacco was the currency, and an excess was as injurious as an
over-issue of bank paper, depreciating on the
market and causing everything to rise in price.
(great care was taken to burn bad tobacco, and
it was as important to the uniformity of the
currency in those days as is now the exclusion
of counterfeits. All the viewings, censorships,
inspections and regulations of the amount of
tobacco to be cultivated by each planter, the
quality to be gathered from each plant, the
rules prescribed, were as important as the laws
of the mint are now.
Judge Mason's tobacco-bag was the next subject of my inquiry.
"isn't cloth-cloth. Is it tobacco-cloth?" I
asked. "Did people have tobacco-cloth as well
as tobacco-money in those days?""NO; this is rattlesnake skin. 'The snake was
killed by Charles Lewis, who lived a long time
ago in my county, Augusta. The Indians caught
him, tied his hands behind him and made him
walk two hundred miles. As they were going
along a high precipice he broke the cords and
jumped down. The Indians followed and he
escaped by springing over a fallen tree, landing among the tall weeds. His pursuers did
not see him fall and they jumped over both the
tree and the man and ran on as fast as they
could. Lying there he heard the hissing of a
snake and opening his eyes saw a large rattlesnake almost touching him. It moved its rattles
and twice they rested upon his ear and neck.
He was so numbed with fright that he could
not move, luckily for him, for if he had moved
a muscle or breathed the snake would have bitten him. Its eyes glared into his and it seemed
to think he was dead, and so wriggled away.
He picked up a stone and hit it upon the head,
killing it, and carried home the rattles and skin
and this bag was made from a piece of that
skin."
The mother of this Charles Lewis was the
beautiful daughter of the Laird of Loch Lyn,
and to his father, John Lewis, was accredited
the introduction of red clover. The white or
wild clover was of indigenous growth and abounded in great plenty, but the red clover
was not known until the blood of the red man,
shed by the Lewises and their followers, suddenly dyed the trefoil to its sanguinary hue.
The Indians fully believed this legend and superstitiously held the red clover sacred. The
superstition spread among the settlers and fora long time the milk of a cow that had eaten the
blood-stained blossom was believed to be tainted
with blood.
Little Ned Drewry, the third occupant of the
gig, with a boy's natural indifference to poetic
effusion, had slipped away during my "twinkle
little star" and was playing "paterroller" with
the colored children and the bloodhounds, and
my elders began to talk of the man for whom
he was named, a victim of the Nat Turner insurrection. I was not usually permitted to hear
such gruesome stories, but if they thought of
me at all they must have supposed that I was
too young to understand or too sleepy to notice.
So they told some of the painful incidents connected with the startling episode of 1832, while
T leaned back in my chair and drooped my little
head. Judge Mason's sister, Mrs. Boykin, my
grandmother's friend at Old Point Comfort, had
come near being killed in the insurrection. She
was saved by her maid, who hid her in a woodpile till the danger was over.Thus the simple-hearted, modest, unassuming
old man sat with his long fig-stem Powhatan
clay pipe in his mouth, smoking and talking and
making history for a little child who never forgot the stories he told. Judge Mason was given
all the honors of his State—ten years a Member of the Virginia Assembly, six years her
Representative in Congress, a Judge of the
United States Court for Virginia, Secretary of
the Navy under President Tyler, Attorney-General and Secretary of the Navy under President
Polk, Minister to France in the Pierce administration, one of the three who drew up the
Ostend Manifesto—all these he was to the
world.
To me he has always remained the gentle-
mannered man with sweet face and soft voice
who told the old-time stories in my plantation
home while all, from the master to the humblest
servant and the smallest child, listened with
eager attention and delighted hearts. Two
years before the opening of the war between
the States my grandmother's heart was saddened by the news from Paris of the death of
this old friend.T was Christmas Eve at Holiday's Point
and, in accordance with the custom of generations, the children and grandchildren
were gathered in an unbroken circle around
the old hearthstone.
In my grandfather's day the neighbors called
the old home Holiday's Point because of the
numerous holidays given to the servants. The
community held that if my grandfather had
framed the almanac he would have put into it
twice as many days as did the Arabs and
Romans, that he might have more holidays to
bestow upon his slaves.
The old-fashioned house on the Nansemond
River, between Suffolk to the right and Norfolk
to the left, was built of brick imported from
England. In shape like an L, the four rooms
on the first floor were divided by a passage fifteen feet wide; dining-room and library on one
side, parlor and chamber on the other. Four
large open fireplaces gave warmth and cheerfulness to the corridor. On the first floor of
the L was the nursery and above it the children's room, the name of which was never
changed because, in relation to the household,
its occupants remained children to the end of
the chapter, however the years might age them
in the view of the outside world.
The house fronted the river, which was concealed by a heavy growth of trees until the
door was reached through long lanes of cypress
lined with rows of cedar, when a full view of
the water for miles was presented. Hidden in
the woods was one of the stables, in which old
Starlight had her home near enough to the
cabin to answer "Ung' Bosun's" whistle.
My mother, as usual, had permitted me to
come to Holiday's Point the day before Christmas, the lighting of the Yule Log being one of
my greatest joys. Away back in the early dawn
of my infantile mind lurked a hazy memory of
the time when my little hand had held the candle
that lit the old log at the back of the great
fireplace. That privilege was no longer mine.
Other children had since entered the family
circle, and the youngest child on the plantation,
whether white or black, was the one always
selected to touch off the Yule Log.
Another delightful sensation preliminary to Christmas day at Holiday's Point was the sight
of "Uncle Charles" driving up from the river
waving a paper above the load of Christmas
things and warning us that it contained instructions from Santa Claus that all the contents of the cart should be put away in the
storehouse until he should come on Christmas
eve, and if anyone should touch any of the
boxes or ask questions about what was inside of
them all the good things would turn to ashes
and sawdust and there would be nothing left
when Christmas came, adding, "'Member what
Santa Claus did to Miss Cinderelly when she
didn't mind him, stayin' out late at night."
Though the awesome paper was only a bill of
lading, which Uncle Charles knew very well, believing him we shrank before it in terror. I
watched the unloading curiously, and the colored children, huddled together on the quarter-
kitchen doorsteps, pulled down each other's
heads and whispered mysteriously as the boxes
and barrels were taken out and their contents
announced. There was the hogshead of New
Orleans molasses, with its thick layer of sugar
at the bottom, the long peaked loaves of white
sugar under their thin blue "fool's-caps," the
cases of raisins, dates, figs and tamarinds, barrels of nuts, oranges and crackers, boxes of
cheese and, slyly pushed behind them, hampers mysteriously marked "sundries," which we at
once associated with the coming visit of Santa
Claus himself.
When the rays of the sun were long in the
west the cheerful note of the Yule Log was
heard. The great hickory log, which had lain
on its forked branch support through months
of golden sunshine and mellowing rain, was
carried in on the shoulder of the strongest negro
on the plantation, followed by a rollicking troop
of Christmas revelers, white and black, and
next year's log was put on the Yule Log fork,
which was never left empty.
The Yule Log was laid at the back of the
great fireplace and in front of it were piled
cobs, chips and kindling wood, known to the
plantation servants as "light 'ood,"' a contraction for "light wood," which was the heart of
the pine. It was lit with a wax candle made
in the home kitchen by Aunt Dilsey, a candle
in which I felt a proprietary interest, having
watched with fascinated eyes the process of its
manufacture. Aunt Dilsey had let me draw
one of the doubled and twisted cotton strands
through a tube in the tin mould to form the
wick, and I felt like a conquering hero when
the end of the string emerged from the point
of the tube. There were six of these tubes in
Aunt Dilsey's mould, and when they were all provided with wicks she allowed me to thrust
through the loops at the top of the mould the
little sticks which rested on the frames and
held the strands in place. Then she tied the
wicks very tightly at the ends. 1 watched the
melted white wax poured into the tubes, feeling
as if I were assisting at a magic incantation.
The time of greatest excitement was when, after
the carefully built structure had stood all night
in a cool place to harden, Aunt Dilsey would
cut off the knots at the bottom of the tube, take
hold of the cross-sticks and pull till six long,
beautiful white waxen cylinders would come
out, each with a tuft of soft white cotton at the
end. livery time I saw them emerge from their
cells a separate and distinct miracle seemed to
have been wrought. I have yet a pair of these
moulds.
One of the candles was lighted and placed in
the hand of my little brother, the youngest of
the family group. My father guided the tiny
hand until the flame formed a cross around
which the tongues of fire leaped and caught the
log, embracing it lovingly, climbing upward and
turning blue and crimson and golden and white
and then mingling in a glorified web of color.
Myriads of sparkles shot up the old chimney,
like Christmas prayers flying heavenward. The
crackling of the wood and the fluttering of the flames joined in a Christmas carol for all the
world,
Not the smallest fragment of the log must
be left over after the twelve-day feast. It had
lain seasoning in the sunshine and the starshine,
in the rain and in the wind, in the frost and in
the dew, in winter cold and summer heat, that it
might be well prepared to give itself wholly to
the sacrifice. Had a remnant remained in the
ashes, disaster would have marked the year
until the next Yule Log had removed the
ban by entirely disappearing. Virginia had
not received, with the traditional heritage, the
Old World custom of preserving a fragment of
one Yule Log to serve as a lighting torch for
the next and to ward off evil) demons until
Christmas came again. The servants were to
have holiday while there was a scrap of it left.
The ashes of the Yule Log were carefully
saved apart from the others, as they were of
peculiar sacredness. Lye made from them was
of magic efficacy in the manufacture of soap,
bringing it to a much-desired degree of hardness and excellence. The negroes used the lye
to kill evil spirits and free themselves from the
sins they had committed during the year.
Old Santa Claus's rack, the "chimbly rack,"
made of black walnut and handsomely decorated, with nails driven into it on which the stockings were to be hung, was brought in by Uncle
Charles and placed above the marble mantelpiece. Over each nail was printed the name of
the one for whom it was intended. Aunt Serena brought in the basket of stockings that she
had knit of the finest spun cotton or wool and
hung them on the nails, singing her Christmas
incantation, "Christmas comes but once't a yeah,
En ebby las' niggah has his sheah." The loved
ones who had gone before were remembered
and stockings for them were hung upon the
rack. Their gifts were of money to be used in
providing Christmas cheer for the unfortunate,
the bereaved and the lonely. Thus was the
memory of those who had passed beyond kept
in grateful hearts.
From the wall above the portrait of my
grandfather Underwood, with long hair and
velvet-flowered vest and rolls of cravat, looked
seriously down. I had never seen him, but my
grandmother said that "he believed in God, °
woman and blood; was proud but not haughty,
hospitable, generous, firm and unchangeable
in his opinions, quiet and commanding, affectionate, courting responsibilities instead of
shirking them."
For weeks all had been busy with preparations. The wood had been cut and piled, the
corn gathered, the pigs killed, the mince-meat and souse and fruit cake prepared, the sausage
chopped and the hominy beaten, the winter
clothes all spun, woven and made. We sat by
the fire with rest, peace and wonder in our
hearts, cracking nuts and roasting apples, the
old silver punch-bowl of apple-toddy steaming
on the table, while we listened to stories of
olden times and of times that never were. My
uncle in his cadet uniform, home for the holidays on furlough from the Virginia Military
Institute, told us fascinating tales of soldier-
boy life, sending delicious thrills of joy and
terror through every nerve.
Presently my black mammy took me in her
motherly arms and carried me along the hall
through the middle of the house, flanked by
doors opening into the living rooms, up the wide
stairway into another long corridor bounded
by the same number of doors leading into bedrooms all in their Christmas dress of arborvitae, holly and mistletoe. In each of the fireplaces were wood and kindling to be lit when the
guests should arrive on the morrow. Into the
prettiest and smallest room she carried me and
put me into my little eider-downy trundle bed.
The next morning I was awakened by the
music of the Christmas horns and the popping
of firecrackers. When I had been dressed I was
taken to the dining-room, where my grandmother stood by a table whereon was a large
bow] of egg-nog from which, with a silver ladle,
she was filling glasses for us all, for even the
babies in old Virginia were given a taste of
egg-nog on Christmas morning.
After breakfast my grandmother went to service and would return with guests who were to
come to us after the Christmas sermon in the
lavishly decorated village church.
Soon the first carriage rolled into the yard,
the coachman proudly flourishing the whip,
which he used merely as an insignia of his office. "Dar dey come! Dar dey come! Dar
dey come!" We all ran out to welcome the
visitors. The carriage doors were opened, the
steps folded up on the inside were let down,
and the servants called out "Christmus gif',
Marse, Christmus gif', Missus," all holding out
their hands and clamoring as my uncle emerged
from the coach, "I eotch him firs'! I eoteh him
firs'! I eotch Miss firs', didn' I, Marse?" each
claiming the reward, regardless of actual priority in time.
My uncle was immaculate in frock coat and
trousers of black broadcloth, new boots, snowy
linen front trimmed profusely with ruffles, high
collar and stock and shining silk hat. He turned
with courtly grace and helped Auntie from the
carriage.' ig rand
A little boy was handed out and then a
screaming bundle which turned out to be a
baby girl.
The carriage was laden with boxes and packages of Christmas gifts—a present for each
servant and other articles to be put with
our Christmas stockings still hanging on the
rack.
From the next carriage my father and mother alighted—my father, always my ideal, tall,
stately, erect as an Indian, seemed to me more
than usually handsome as he lifted me up to
a level with his classic face. His holiday attire, snowy ruffles, rigid stock, black broadcloth
and, above all, the flowers of his brocaded vest,
were to me an inexhaustible source of delight.
My beautiful mother's coal-black hair, without
wave or crinkle, was carried plainly from her
face and wound in a plaited coil. She was very
fair and her cheeks looked as if they had stolen
two of the pink roses from the garden of May.
Her eyes were like sparkling sapphires. Her
black moire-antique dress had wide bishop
sleeves, and she wore a white crépe shawl that,
falling back, revealed the square of fine embroidered white thread cambric around her
neck, crossing in front to form a V.
When all the family carriages had come a
stranger might have wondered if grandmother's
house could hold the many who claimed her
Yuletide hospitality. We knew that her home
was measured by her heart.
My father, the oldest son-in-law, was the first
to take down his Christmas stocking from
Santa's rack. He was always sure of a knife,
a black stock and a silk bandanna, whatever else
old Santa might have left for him. His last
year's knife was then given to the foreman.We who could not reach so high were held up
to take down our stockings.

inner was the great event that followed.
Every leaf had been put into the old mahogany
table, and another table added at each end. A
turkey which had been penned up for weeks to
fatten and become tender, stuffed with pecan
nuts, lay in delicious brownness on a china
platter. Opposite was a roast pig with an
orange in its mouth, "kase pigs kin have apples
every day, but come Christmus 'course even
pigs must have sump'n extra," my mammy explained. On one side of the table was a huge
dish of fried oysters, on the other an old Smith-
field ham, baked as it could be only by one born
to the art. Sweet and sour pickles and pre-serves, for which Aunt Dilsey was famous, were
scattered about among all the vegetables known
to a Virginia plantation. On a side table were
a saddle of mutton, a round of beef and a bowl
of chicken salad. On another table was the dessert—sillibub, tipsy-cake, charlotte-russe,
mince-pies, plain cake and fruit cake, to be followed by the plum pudding, flaming with magic
fires which must be left to burn out of themselves, lest some of the glow they held in their
fiery hearts should fail to be diffused throughout our lives in the coming year. The sideboard
glistened with decanters and glasses and great
bowls of apple-toddy and egg-nog.
All the good things left were sent to supplement the feast of the servants which they had
spent days in preparing. It was spread in the
wide old weaving-room, the loom being hidden
by decorations of holly and mistletoe. We went
in to see their table with its beautiful ornamentations, loaded with goodies, *possum and
sweet potatoes at each end. The 'possums had
been caught early and fed in a lavishly hospitable manner, that they might wax fat and juicy
for the feast.
After dinner papa and the uncles, followed by
the boy friends and cousins, went out to the
office in the ward a short distance from the
mansion house and soon such mirthful peals is-sued therefrom that curiosity called us all out
and the house was deserted while we sat listening to such stories and jokes as we shall never
enjoy again. 'Then they talked of fox hunts,
of the prancing gray and the good old red that
had carried them to victory, the music of the
horns, the baying of the hounds, the laughing
girls, all eager for the brush. Crouched by my

crops, the condition of the roads, the neighborhood news, the latest styles in collars and stocks,

man came by and mammy took
me up to my little trundle bed. Half lost between waking and sleeping, I heard the crunching of the snow beneath the tread of horses and
the roll of wheels and knew that some of the
guests who lived near were returning to their
homes. Melodies, dance-songs and the shuffling
and pattering of feet, mingled with the thrum
of the banjo, bones and fiddle, floated from the
negro quarters.
Soon old mammy and her turban, the black
faces, the hand-fed lamb, the goats and dogs,
the coons and the rabbits, the peacocks' gorgeous big-eyed tails, and long-whiskered Santa
Claus, my grandmother, my mother's lovely eyes
and the Blessed Babe in the manger, all got
mixed up in a tangle of shadows and came sliding between the peeping, twinkling stars on a
moonbeam into the room and danced around my
trundle bed.
With my tender little heart full of child love
and unwavering faith, my wee soul borne on the
higher sentiments of adoration, faith and spiritual sympathy, my Christmas dolly clasped close

smiles, I laughed and—a-n-d—a-n—Christmas

to play his important part in holding San Juan

springtime vales of gay flirtation, sometimes
into the warm, deep dells of love. Many were
the belles and beaux who met their fate amid
the leat-walled environment of Greenbrier and
more matches were made there than in heaven.
My Soldier's furlough soon came to a close
and he left, by chance, the day we did. I shall
never forget the ride on the top of the old stagecoach, the wonderful red and gold foliage, the
birds that sang in the autumn trees, the good
dinner at the hotel, the stories told me by my
Soldier, who knew everything, I thought. Of
the name Greenbrier he said:
1 Tbeen owne iunter, wandering through the woods, came to the river-bank and observed that the
water ran in a direction opposite from the usual
course and reported it, exciting the curiosity of
two New Englanders, Jacob Martin and Stephen
Sewall. They took up land there, living together in a little cabin until one day they quarreled and separated. One made his home in
a hollow tree, the other keeping the cabin in which they had formerly dwelt in peace with
the world, themselves and each other. They
agreed never to say anything to each other but
'Good morning, Mr. Martin,' 'Good morning,
Mr. Sewall,' confining themselves to this limited conversation for the remainder of their
years."
My Soldier told me of the Indian wars after
peace had been confirmed between England and
France, the Dunmore wars, the massacre at
Muddy Creek where, under the guise of friendship, the Indians had descended upon the settlers and destroyed their village, the attack of
two hundred Indians upon Donnally Fort, and
the bravery of the old negro, Dick Pointer,
whose freedom was purchased by the State of
Virginia in reward for his services. In his
helpless old age an unsuccessful effort was made
to secure a pension for him. Comparing his
fate with that of alleged soldiers of later years
who volunteered to do guard duty around their
homes for three days, receiving pensions for
their courageous efforts, one might wish that
he had lived in a later period and served a more
appreciative government.
From White Sulphur I returned to my
father's home, brightened now by three brothers
and two sisters, all of whom had seen so little
of "Sister" that they knew nothing of her short-comings and thought she was the greatest thing
in the world.

It was a serious epoch was to go among strangers for the first fod so the farewells were solemn.
As a parting present, "Uncle Charles" brought
me a nest of guinea eggs, a box of sweet gum
which he had been collecting for months, a string of chinquapins and some dried haws, saying as he gave them to me:
"Honey, don't fergit de ole man en bring him

At Richmond a man in uniform boarded the
train. I looked at him with admiration as he
came down the aisle. He was tall and walked
erectly with graceful carriage and a commanding air not dependent upon bis military dress.
He stopped and spoke to my father, who arose,
greeted him cordially and, turning back the
seat, invited him to join us. He accepted and
my father introduced "Colonel Robert E. Lee."
The Colonel shook hands with me m a gentle
way and began to barter for one of my long
curls. In my diffidence I did not close with any
of his offers, though I would have given every

to my romantic vision, Colonel Lee was a me) aman. said that he had just returned from
Harper's Ferry, where there had been great excitement. John Brown had descended upon the
town and taken possession of the United States
Arsenal. Colonel Lee, home on furlough from
the West, had been sent with the marines from
the Washington barracks and four companies
of troops from Fortress Monroe to dispossess
them and restore quiet to the little town in the
Virginia hills. It was not alone Harper's Ferry
that had been terrorized; the entire state had
been thrown into a turmoil of excitement.To a child whose infancy had shuddered at
the story of the Nat Turner insurrection of
1832, the John Brown raid in 1859 was a subject of horrible fascination, and I listened intently as Colonel Lee talked of this strange old
fanatic and his followers.
"What do you think would be the effect upon
the negro, Mr. Corbell,' Colonel Lee asked my
father, "if we should be compelled to hang John Brown?"
My father replied, "Well, I've thought of that,
too, Colonel, and I asked my foreman, who is
a representative of his race, if he did not think
we ought to hang old John Brown. He looked
at me earnestly for a while then, shaking his
head slowly, said, "IT knows, Marse Dae, dat po'
Marse John done en bruk de law, killin' all dem

John did bre'k de law, don't you think, suh, dat

Colonel Lee laughed and replied, "I think that
just about expresses the sentiment not only of
the colored people but of many others." They
agreed that John Brown was an honest, earnest,
courageous old man and that his friends ought
to put him where he would be cared for.
My eyes were turned steadily toward Colonel
Lee with a large measure of that admiration
he won from observers older and more experienced than I.
The story of John Brown was graphically
told and heard with absorbed attention, but it
is not likely that the Virginia planter with all
his knowledge of history and character, nor the
great soldier with his military training, recognized signs of the impending storm any more
than did the wide-eyed child lost in breathless
wonderment over the thrilling episode.
At the next station the Colonel left us and I

Virginia held longest by the Union, the bonds
of which had clasped the States together until
the Old Dominion had forgotten that political
ties are not eternal. Since the brave Thirteen
had banded together to fight for liberty, Virginia had clung with unswerving tenacity to the
central idea that had kept the States together
through many severe tests of loyalty. Forged
in the fires of the Revolution, the chain that
bound her to the Union of States had grown
stronger with the years and with the blood of
many battles. The Mother of Presidents and
of patriotic Statesmen, her devotion to the welfare of the nation was of unusual depth and
ardor. Politicians sought to drag her allegiance from the flag whose stars lit the path of
her great sons, Washington, Jefferson, Madison,
and the many who had worthily represented her
in the work of building up the nation, but the
people stood firmly by their history and hereditary faith.

huzzahs rang out triumphantly and all was glowing to Boe vision of hope.
Some weeks
later when the news of the battle of Manassas
came surging along the line, we felt that events
had justified our enthusiasm. In imagination we beheld our flag floating over a great new
country that should rival the nations of the

rusted Her  éweilly +o th yrineipa of then a morning that was like ideal May, the
8th of March, 1862, I sat on my horse by
the river bank at Blinkhorn, opposite
Newport News. My uncle, Colonel J. J. Phillips, was stationed there, and I had come to the
camp and was one of the hundreds gathered on
the bank of the Nansemond River at that point,
all eyes turned with eager interest toward
Hampton Roads, where lay our new battleship,
the Virginia.
Like a phoenix, she had arisen from the
wreck of the old frigate Merrimac. Grim, solemn, weird, built low upon the water, she
was not boat nor ram nor submarine, nor anything else hitherto known to the waves. Newly
clad in her robe of iron, she was a veiled mystery, a forlorn hope, a theory, an armed engine,
a steam battery protected by armor, an experiment destined to change the course of naval
warfare. Being the first ship built in the Old
Dominion, she was named for her State, Virginia. Commanded by Captain Buchanan and
manned by a crew composed Largely of landsmen who had volunteered from the Army, she
had waited in Hampton Roads for the dawning
of her day.
Through my field-glass I watched the Virginia gliding like a great white bird hovering
between the pulsing, scintillate blue of the
heavens above and the waters beneath. Accompanied by the gunboats Raleigh and Beaufort, she passed along amid the cheers of the
enthusiastic onlookers thronging both banks and
of the troops at the batteries around the harbor.
An awesome feeling took possession of me,
holding me silent until the enthusiasm of the
crowd thrilled me and I waved my handkerchief in messages of Godspeed to the brave new craft.
Slowly she rounded Craney Island, lying like
a blue-gray cloud over the water, her batteries
turned toward the Norfolk shore. The troops
waved their caps and sent up lusty cheers for
the strange craft that looked, as some one afterward said, "like a huge terrapin with a large
round chimney about the middle of its back."
Waving passed the island, she turned into the
south channel and slowly moved on toward Newport News until, coming within firing range of the United States frigates Congress and Cumberland, she was greeted with broadsides from
both. A flash of fire, pale against the white
day, a puff of smoke, widening, drifting, wreathing around the mouth of the gun and floating
off into space, a deep roar of thunder showed
us that our Virginia was bearing well her brave
old name,
The enthusiasm which had greeted her appearance was as nothing compared with the excitement that thrilled us now. Yells of encouragement and defiance rent the air. Handkerchiefs fluttered; hats were thrown aloft. Some
of the men danced; others turned somersaults
of enthusiasm. One soldier rushed to Colonel
Phillips shouting, "Say, Colonel, say; can't we
do something? Can't we help? For God's
sake, let us do something to help them!"
Fortunately there was no bridge from the
shore to the scene of action. Otherwise every
man, woman and child among that seething
crowd might have rushed into the fight, to the
embarrassment of the plucky little Virginia.
We could do our part only by going into paroxysms of patriotism, in which we all excelled.
The Virginia went on up the channel, turned
and, coming back, ran full against the Cumberland, penetrating her side with the sharp prow
of the Confederate ironclad. The frigate reeled, shuddered, and began slowly to settle,
her guns roaring from her deck. The Congress
came to her assistance, but the shots which
rained from the two frigates fell harmlessly
from the slanting sides of the Virginia.
With fascinated eyes I watched the Cumberland tossing upon the waves, gradually sinking,
firing another volley as her bow went down,
then disappearing under the water, the flag that
floated from her masthead still fluttering above
the sea,
For days we had seen that frigate with her
mate, the Congress, threatening us, a blot upon
our waters, a monster, a thing of evil, waiting
for the moment of fate. But it was pitiful to
watch her go down, and I think every heart
there felt a pride in that pennant waving defiantly above the water, even while we cheered
our victorious Virginia. She went on, turned
and came back to attack the Congress which, in
trying to escape, ran aground. She was soon
ablaze, banners of flame flapping out from her
rigging. In an hour her flag fell.
We were told afterward that in one of the
ships which we could dimly descry in the distance, an old man waited for the battle and for
tidings of his son, commander of the Congress.
When they told him that the flag was down he
said sadly, "Then Joe is dead!" He knew by that signal that his son "Joe," Captain Joseph
B. Smith, had fallen.
The Raleigh and Beaufort drew up beside
the flaming Congress, under a heavy fire from
the Federal batteries on the Newport News
shore which not only did execution upon the
crews of the Confederate gunboats, but proved
fatal to some of the prisoners from the burning frigate. The Virginia's launch rowed toward the Congress and was struck by a volley
from the Federal battery.
Beyond the Congress the Minnesota lay
aground. Before the surrender of the Congress
the Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson and
Teazer, the James River squadron, passed the
Federal batteries, the Patrick Henry was struck
through the boiler and was towed out of action
by the Thomas Jefferson, returning after repairs and running up close to the grounded
Minnesota, being light and able to come nearer
than the heavier ironclad. Tull night fell we
watched the gunboats raining shot upon the
Minnesota, the Virginia, from her greater distance, occasionally firing ponderously upon the
grounded frigate. When darkness prevented
correct aim the Virginia and her sturdy little
assistants retired, slowly moving to Sewell's
Point. We returned to our homes, awed by the
grandeur of the scene, sorrowful for the lost lives, but triumphant in the victory won by our
brave little craft.
Those who watched through the hours of
darkness beheld a brilliant fire-scene displayed
against the velvety night. Steadily the Congress had flamed upward, paling the stars in
its red glow. At midnight banners of flame,
showers of stars, fiery serpents writhing upward in sinuous pathways through the dense
columns of smoke, marked the end.
That night a new-comer arrived and next
morning was lying behind the grounded Minnesota—a queer object, afterward described as
"a tin can on a shingle." It was Erickson's
little Monitor, commanded by Captain Worden
and manned by a volunteer crew, for no one
was ordered for service on the odd little craft
with its revolving turret. The position was
risky and no officer wanted to reflect later
that he had sent men to death on a wild experiment.
Those who could get a clear view of the
stranger thought that she was a raft sent to
save the crew of the Minnesota, but she steamed
up toward the Virginia with a war-like expression which left no doubt as to her real character.
From tidings sent from New York we had expected the new invention down in our waters,
but our imagination had not wound itself around anything so funny looking and we did
not recognize her until she revealed herself.
I was early at my post, eager to see the end
of the fray. My uncle had his boat ready to
put out to the scene of action.
"Oh, uncle, may I go?" I cried, running after
him.
"No, no!" he shouted. "Go back!"
He stepped into the boat and pulled off without looking behind and did not see that I followed and took a seat in the boat, with sketchbook and pencil, prepared to take battle views
at first hand. Perhaps an artist of to-day might
regard my sketch-book with some degree of
scorn, constructed as it was of wall paper,
turned plain side out, cut into leaves of convenient size, and bound together, the handiwork
of my ingenious grandmother. It was the best
the Confederacy could afford just then and perhaps it served the purpose as well as a more
artistic outfit might have done. I shall never
forget the look of horrified amazement that
overspread my uncle's face as he chanced to
look backward.
"You little dare-devil, you!" he called out,
"Pye a good mind to drown you!"
The absurdity of the situation flashed upon
him and his shout of laughter rang over the
water. We were too far out to admit of turning back to put me ashore and there was nothing he could do but endure my company.
"You needn't think I am going to try to keep
you out of danger, you disobedient, incorrigible
little minx," he said indignantly. "It would
serve you right if you were shot."
I was not thinking of danger. It was my
first chance at a sea-fight and 1 was not going
to miss it.
Thus I watched the first battle of iron-clad
warships. Apparently recognizing the fact that
they had in a moment become useless lumber,
the old-time wooden structures drew aside and
observed the novel contest. The two little
giants were almost touching and broadside after
broadside poured into each other. My uncle
was absorbed in watching the scene.
"Let me see! Let me see!' I cried all aquiver
with excitement.
"T will not let you see, you miserable little
wretch!" he replied.
Then relenting, he gave me the field-glass.
"Well, here; look! Be careful or you will lose
your balance and fall overboard, though J
reckon it would be a good thing if you did.
Teach you better than to put yourself where
you have no business."
His sense of humor, as usual, saved the situation, and he laughed again. I think there was never a time since I routed him out at midnight
to take a neck-breaking ride in a hail-storm
that I was not an amusing, as well as a terrifying conundrum to my unfortunate uncle. He
good-naturedly shared his glass with disobedient little me and I watched the contest.
The storm that rained upon the Virginia was
of solid shot and shell, while it had been impossible to provide the Confederate ram with
anything but shell. The armor of the Monitor
was thicker than that of her antagonist but the
inclination of the sides of the Virginia, causing
the shot to glance harmlessly, offset that advantage. The Virginia suddenly ran aground
and the Monitor was quick to avail herself of
the mishap, but before we were certain of the
peril of our champion she was off and making
an effort to run down the Monitor. The bow
of the Virginia was directly against her antagonist and we saw the Federal ship careen dangerously. When they separated a shell from
our ironclad struck the pilot-house of the Monitor. We afterward learned that her commander, Lieutenant Worden, was disabled.
The Minnesota was helpless and as the Virginia turned toward her we expected that she
would be sunk. But, probably to the delight
of those on board the frigate as well as to the
infinite dismay of us who looked on, our little steamer went on her way toward Sewell's Point
and then to the Navy Yard. Our disappointment was very great and as we were rowing
home my uncle said reflectively :
"By George, it looks as if the Lord was on
the side of those damned Yankees."
It was the first time I had ever heard him
admit the possibility that Providence could be
on the wrong side of anything.
We heard later that, so certain seemed the
destruction of the Minnesota, her captain
was making preparations to fire and abandon
her when, to his surprise, the Merrimac, or Virginia, as we renamed her, turned homeward,
Our captain afterward explained that he
thought his last shot had disabled the Monitor
and he dared not stay any Longer in those waters
because the Virginia had so heavy a draught
that it was impossible for her to cross the bar
after ebb-tide.N the Battle of Seven Pines, May 31 and
June 1, 1862, Pickett's Brigade played a
most important and gallant part, an account
of which may be seen in General Joseph EF.
Johnston's report and in General Pickett's own
report as given in "Pickett and His Men."
While the battle yet raged darkness came
on to force a truce. General Johnston ordered
his troops to sleep on their lines to be ready
for the morning. Shortly after seven he was
slightly wounded by a musket shot. A little
later he remarked to one of his Colonels who
dodged a shell:
"There is no use in dodging like that, Colonel.
When you hear the things they have passed."
At that moment a shell exploded, striking him
in the breast. He fell unconscious into the
arms of Drewry L. Armistead, one of his couriers. On regaining consciousness he missed his
sword and pistols, and said:
"My father wore that sword in the Revolutionary War and I would not lose it for ten
thousand dollars. The pistols Colonel Colt, the
inventor, gave me."
Both sword and pistols were recovered and
General Johnston, the natural magnet for bullets, an officer of the highest soldierly qualities,
of military skill and sagacity equalled by few
and surpassed by none, was carried off the field
severely wounded. General Robert E. Lee was
appointed to the command of the Army of
Northern Virginia, to become the idol of his
people and one of the greatest military leaders
of the world; greater than will ever be known,
because of the restrictions laid upon his power.
Though he was the General in command he was
under the direction of the War Department,
which exercised its authority to the utmost.
Perhaps our Confederacy might have been
longer lived if Lee had adopted the policy of
Stonewall Jackson who, when ordered to recall
General Loring from Romney, obeyed like a
soldier and promptly sent in his resignation
like a mere human.
If IT could bring before you the picture of
the Richmond T saw after the battle of Seven
Pines you would say that it was the most powerful peace argument ever penned. But no words
could give you the faintest shadow of the Richmond of those days of anguish. Could Dante
have looked upon our Capital in that opening
June he would have needed no Virgil to unlock
for him the gates of Inferno, no Beatrice to
lead him through the midnight corridors of a
lost world to the torture chamber of condemned
souls. He would have turned his gaze upon our
streets, dipped his pen in his heart's blood and
written, and mankind would have shuddered
through all the ages to come.
Richmond was shaking with the thunders of
the battle and the death-sounds thrilled through
our agonized souls. The blood of the field was
running in rivers of red through the hearts
of her people. For days the dead-wagons and
ambulances wended their tragic way from the
battlefield to the Capital City and every turn
of their crunching wheels rolled over our
crushed and bleeding hearts. The wretched
loads of wounded were emptied before the doors
of the improvised hospitals until they overflowed with maimed humanity and all hearts
and hands were full of grief for the dead and
work for the wounded.
There was not a home in the city that held
not some ghastly offering from the battlefield.
Every possible space was converted into a temporary hospital and all was done that unwearied nursing and gentle care could effect, for the roughest in the ranks as tenderly as for
those who wore the stars. Women, girls, and
children stood before the doors with wine and
food for the wounded as they passed. It was
not unusual to see half a dozen funeral processions at the same time on their way to the City
of the Dead.
The Capitol square was filled with officers,
privates and citizens, seeking information of
the battle. From all the Southland poured
in letters from friends and relatives, with
the sacred charge to care for their loved
ones. From all quarters of the Confederacy
wives followed their husbands, mothers their
sons.
"Come, Lassie, here is a telegram from Mrs.
B——~-," said my hostess. "Come, dear, and go
with me to the train to meet her. How I dread
it, poor, dear lady!"
There was a sublime faith in the motherly
face that met us in the station—a faith that
lifted up our hearts to the heights of Divinity.
There was no question, no fear, in the serene,
loving eyes. "I've come to see my boy; he
was with General Johnston," she said.
We drove back through a mourning Richmond, a strange, foreign Richmond that the
mother did not know. From the doors of the
houses hung streamers of black. Ambulances filled with wounded passed us, their torturing
road marked by the trail of blood that oozed,
drop by drop, from human veins.
Wagons filled with dead rolled by, the stiffened bodies piled one upon another in ghastly
heaps, the rigid feet projecting from the ends
of the vehicles. It was the most appalling
sight that ever greeted human eyes, but it was
the only way to save our fallen soldiers from
the desecration of birds of prey. All the
vehicles of every description were utilized, the
less severely wounded walking, their wounds
bound in bloody rags. They formed a long
procession, nearly five thousand, young boys,
middle-aged and old men, from privates to high
officers, passing on to the homes of Richmond
where they would find tender care. From some
of the open windows came shrieks of pain from
those whose courage had been overcome by
mortal agony. Down the streets new regiments
were marching to the front to fill, in time, other
dead-wagons and ambulances.
Sometimes the Richmond of those days comes
back to me now and I shudder anew with terror.
Reaching the beautiful home of our friend
and hostess, we hurried our beloved charge, this
sweet mother of a soldier, through corridors
where closed doors guarded scenes which could
be but dimly imagined. Up the stairway and along the all to a small room she followed our
friend, who sent me down to order up a waiter
of refreshments. On my return she came out
to meet me.
"She does not know, Lassie; ah, who will
tell her? Heaven help her! Heaven help her!"
Later I saw her go with firm step, erect form,
and faith-redeemed face, and stop silently as if
in prayer at a closed door. Some one had told
her. The door opened and she passed through.
Then it gently shut, leaving her alone with her
dead. the war-weary of the Federals, and the
battle of Gaines's Mill, June 27, 1862,
was the turning point of the seven days' battles
around our Capital. No event of the memorable campaign which had followed that slogan
was more important in its results than this desperate conflict.
MeClellan in his retreat had burned and destroyed everything that could be carried away
until he reached Watts's Farm, known also by
the names of Gaines's Mill and Cold Harbor,
and there was fought the greatest battle of the
war, up to that time. The great stage painter,
Nature, had never arranged a more picturesque
scene for a battle than that which was set for
Gaines's Mill, one of the most awful contests
of the war. It was an undulating plain gracefully rising into gentle swells, crowned by a
dense growth of trees. It terminated in a tall

BK months "On to Richmond" had been
cliff, a great rounded mass of rock which had
been hurled from its native bed so many centuries ago as to be now covered with a large
forest. Directly in front of the cliff, separated
by a deep gorge, was a low level field partly
covered by a heavy crop of oats which, together
with a natural growth of broom-sedge, afforded
concealment to MeClellan's sharpshooters and
lines of skirmishers. The cliff was defended
by three tiers of field artillery and a heavy infantry support.

In spite of my green glasses I could not help
forming a mental picture of the man who had
been chosen as our political head. He was tall
and extremely slender, but of indescribable dignity and grace. He was a type of the Old
South, cultivated, refined, a brilliant conversationalist. his eyes were clear and of a blue-gray
color. He had a high forehead, straight nose,
thin, compressed lips, pointed chin, prominent
cheek bones, and deep lines around his mouth.
His face was thin, features long and sharp, expression intense. There was no pomp in his
movements, neither was there anything uncertain. His walk was wonderful; just what a
President's walk ought to be but seldom is.
When he rode, the beautiful unaffected harmony
and grace of every motion were fascinating.
He pressed my Soldier's left hand, laying it
gently down on the arm of the chair to avoid
jarring him.
"How soon will you be able to go back?" he
asked. 'We need you in the field."
"T should like to go to-morrow," was the
reply.
The President shook his head, and entered
upon a brief account of the fighting after the
battle of Gaines's Mill, praising my Soldier's
brother, Major Charles Pickett, who had been
wounded at Frazier's Farm, carrying the flagon foot after his horse had been shot from under
him. I saw the President's eyes flash as he
said:
the world began to knowehinr for what He was. He came to see my Soldier and asked after his
welfare.
General Jackson talked of Gaines's Mill and
said that General Whiting, of his command, had
lost his way and, not knowing where to find
his commander, had reported to General Longstreet, who put his brigade a little in the rear
of Pickett's men, so that the two brigades together made the assault which broke the enemy's
lines. My always

While they were talking mint juleps were
brought in, which Jackson declined, saying, "I
never touch strong drink. I like it too well to
fool with it, and no man's strength is strong
enough to enable him to touch the stuff with
impunity."
Julie, politely curtseying, came to the defense
of her juleps:

Perhaps no one but Stonewall Jackson could
have lived up to the stern Puritanism which
made him so indifferent to external things—always more rigidly uncompromising for himself
than for others. The same sturdy determination which had led the untrained boy years
before to seek and obtain an appointment to
West Point in the face of a multitude of discouragements was shown in Stonewall's famous
requisition, "Send me twenty thousand men and
no orders." The spirit which held Lieutenant
Jackson to his guns in Mexico after all his men
had been killed or driven away, and had won
for him two promotions in one day, was the
same spirit in which, having received an order
that upset his well-matured plans, he promptly
obeyed and as promptly sent in his resignation.
The South had then learned his worth and her
protest led him to withdraw his resignation,
but he was never again hampered by instructions from the War Department.
It was said in the army that General Jackson was afraid of nothing but his own soldiers.
Their expressions of devotion alarmed him.
Riding his chestnut sorrel, his tall, powerful
form bent forward, his long, solemn face, with
high cheek bones half lost in heavy reddish-
brown beard, his gray eyes cast downward,
when he unexpectedly came upon his men the
first cheer would cause him to straighten back,
hold his shoulders erect, doff the old fatigue
cap that concealed his receding forehead, spur
up his horse and dash off at full speed, followed
by ringing shouts until he was lost to view.
Then came Chancellorsville with its thrill of
triumph, followed by the knowledge of the immeasurable cost of the victory.
In the Executive Mansion I helped Lizzie
Letcher, the daughter of the Governor, and Miss
Missouri Godwin, now the widow of General Ordway, pin tuberoses tied with crépe on the
lapels of those who with sad hearts followed
their honored leader for the last time. At the
grave each soldier took off his flower and laid it
on the sacred mound.
The question asked in °61, "Who is this T. J.
Jackson?" had been answered from many a
battlefield. When the shot that struck him
down sent its mournful message around the
world the fullest response to that query came
from the mourning hearts of friend and foe
alike. Beyond the sea he was recorded as "one
who took to a soldier's grave the love of the
whole world and the name of Stonewall Jackson,"
General Garnett was one of those who had
been hurt by the severity of the hero's military
discipline. My Soldier had charge of General
Jackson's funeral and Garnett came to him and
asked permission to take part. Of all who followed the great soldier to his grave there was
no mourner more sincere. All antagonisms were
drowned in the flood of veneration which surged
around his name and fame. ON my next vacation, as my father could not
come to Lynchburg for several days to take
me home, he wrote that my mother suggested that I accept an invitation from a classmate in Lovingston, Virginia. Four others of
our class were invited and we were having an
old-time Virginia house-party, where friends
and neighbors vied with our hosts in giving us
pleasure, when a telegram came from my father
saying that his old friend, Dr. Seon, a celebrated
minister who had just romantically made his
escape from prison in his daughter's clothes,
would pass through Lynchburg the following
day and would escort me home. Though sorry
to make a break in our house-party I was glad
to go, as it furthered the plan of my Soldier,
which I had feared would go astray, to meet
me in Petersburg where I was to stop over fora few days on my way home. On the train
the doctor said:
"Lassie, I found, to my delight, the son of
an old friend in the forward coach, whom I
would like to present to you if I may. I have
just told him I was traveling with a little lady-
girl, or a little girl-lady, who was making me
forget age and wars and troubles—just a ripple
of sunshine, but a wee hit of a rascal withal.
Shan't tell you what else I said, nor half the
things he told me in reply about matching you
against a certain young lady of his acquaintance, which young lady, I am inclined to think,
is more than an 'acquaintance, so I give you
fair warning not to fall in love with him."
I replied that I should be delighted to meet
his friend but needed no warning, as I had an
acquaintance, too, who was more than an 'acquaintance,' and whom I would match against
the entire universe.
I was handing the remainder of our luncheon
out of the window to a half-clad, hungry looking soldier when the doctor returned with his
friend and said:
"Miss Corbell, allow me to present to you
the son of my old friend, of Henrico County,
Virginia, General Pickett."
My heart jumped into my throat with delight
and surprise and in breathless jerks I cried out
~~"Oh, my Soldier, my Soldier."
"T had no idea whom T was to have the honor of meeting," said my Soldier. 'This, doctor, is
the acquaintance of whom I spoke."
"Ah-ha!" Said the doctor, "ah-ha!' He offered my Soldier his seat beside me, and the rest
of the journey was a beautiful, beautiful, soulful
dream. My Soldier stopped off at Richmond,
and I went on to Petersburg, where I was the
guest of Mr. and Mrs. Dunean.
My friends in Petersburg had announced my
coming, and a number of engagements had been
made for me. The first was a large party at
the Johnsons' and the next at the Raglands'. I
did not know whether my Soldier would approve
of my going without him and I neither wished
to go nor approved of it myself, so I begged to
be allowed to await his arrival the next day and
make my first appearance with him. On seeing
his look of loving appreciation I was very
thankful to have made the decision. The party
at the Raglands' was one of the largest and
most brilliant ever given in Petersburg, and
that evening our engagement was announced.
Two days later I was to start for my father's
home but was amazed, especially as my Soldier
was in command, to find that I could not get a
permit. He was positive in his refusal] and
would make no exception in my favor. However, he consented to date for me a permit a
week in advance. At the end of the week I said good-bye to him at the station and for the first
time was wounded by him, almost heart-broken,
because he did not seem as sorry at parting from
me as I thought he ought to be. Besides, there
was a peculiar quizzical twinkle in his eye that
puzzled me and occupied my thoughts all the
way down to Ivor Station, where my uncle, Doctor Phillips, met me. Though fretting because
the parting had seemed of so little moment to
my Soldier and wishing that I had not been
sorry either, that is, not so sorry as I was, the
drive from the station proved most pleasant and
brought us to my uncle's near noon. 'That evening as I was about to retire, a little after eight
(they go to bed early in the country), we heard
horses galloping down the lane.
"Listen to the clanking of the swords," said
my uncle. "Those are certainly soldiers and I
did not know there were any within miles of us."
T listened, heard the horses turned over to the
orderly, heard footsteps on the gravel, then on
the porch, and in answer to my uncle's greeting
T recognized with unutterable joy the voice of
my own Soldier and that of one of his staff.
They were asking for me, had been welcomed,
and the candle was lighting them into the parlor. The dread mystery of my Soldier's cheerfulness at parting from me was explained. He
had come through on the same day with a part of his division and they were then in camp on
the Blackwater a few miles distant.
When the division crossed the Blackwater and
marched on to Suffolk I went to the home of
my aunt, Mrs. Eley, at Barber's Cross Roads,
a distance of about ten miles from Suffolk.
Here when all was quiet along the lines my
Soldier would ride in from his headquarters almost every night between the hours of sunset
and sunrise to see me—a ride of about thirty
miles. While these short visits were glimpses
of heaven to me, they resulted sadly for my
aunt, whose house, in consequence, was burned
by the Federals.
At the earnest solicitation of my Soldier, who
feared my remaining within the enemy's lines,
T went to an old friend in Richmond, Mrs.
Shields, the wife of Colonel Shields. When on
this visit I first met General "Jeb" Stuart, the
"Red Fox" of the Confederacy, thus named because of the blonde glory of his coloring and
the swiftness of his movements, as well as his
wiliness in evading pursuit. He was said to
be one of the handsomest men in the South,
and perhaps it was true, but I was at that time
too much absorbed in the contemplation of the,
to me, handsomest man in the world to have
discriminating eyes for the beauty of anyone
else.Among those of our officers most noted for
personal attractions was General Longstreet,
who was thought to resemble "Jeb" in appearance. <A story is told of an ardent admirer of
the "Red Fox" who, meeting the "old War
Horse," General Longstreet, said, "General Stuart, I just met a man who told me of mistaking you for General Longstreet, but I don't see
how he could. Longstreet is not half as handsome as you are." General Longstreet gravely
replied, "Yes, I am sometimes taken for Longstreet."
As we danced at a ball at "Yellow Tavern'
General Stuart teasingly commiserated my Soldier on his bad luck in belonging to the infantry.
"Tam sorry for Pickett, poor fellow! He has
to walk. Upon my word, he ought to be in the
cavalry. He deserves it. What a pity! And
you, Miss Lassie—why should you throw yourself away on the infantry? You ought to marry
a cavalryman."
I tried to defend myself and set forth the
greater advantages of the infantry service.
"Pickett is lucky," he replied, "in having such
a champion. I am in love with him myself and
agree with you perfectly, for Pickett can do
anything. When I see him dance I think he
ought to be a dancing-master. When I see him
ride I think he ought to be a cavalry leader.When he whistles I think he ought to be a bird.
When he sings it seems that he ought to bean opera star. When I see him lead a charge I
feel that he ought to spend his life on the battlefield. Yes, Pickett can do anything and do it
well. As for poor me—all I can do is to make
love."
Inexperienced as I was, I knew that the "Red
Fox" could do everything that was brave and
fine and great. As for making love—there was
only one who knew his power in that art—the
lovely woman who possessed all his gallant
heart and has worthily borne his great name
through years of wearing toil and lonely sorrow.
In the battle or on the road a song or a laugh
was always on his lips and the hearts of his
men leaped up to meet his gayety as well as his
fearlessness.
To few men is it given to go through a great
war untouched by any ball except the fatal one.
Such was the gift that Mars bestowed upon his
brilliant follower and in less than a year from
that festive night at this same Yellow Tavern
the blood-red seal was set upon a youth that
was immortal.NOTWITHSTANDING war and war's
alarms, when I should be launched into
the world with a diploma in my hand
and the blessings of my Alma Mater on my
head my Soldier was to marry me. Cupid does
not readily give way to Mars, and in our Southern country a lull between bugle calls was likely
to be filled with the music of wedding bells.
But Mars was in the ascendant for the time,
and when I was graduated the Army of Northern Virginia was marching to an undetermined
battlefield in Pennsylvania.
Then came Gettysburg, and the wave of triumph set rolling at Fredericksburg and mounting higher at Chancellorsville surged anew, for
the first news that came to us was of a great
victory. So we rode on the flood-tide of fancied
suecess and fell with the

Governor of Virginia and more than sixty of
Richmond's best known citizens. The fire and
the long funeral procession had been described
to him by those who held in memory the mournful cortége darkening the streets of the beautiful city as Death had clouded the lives of the
thousands who followed their loved ones for the
last time on earth.Only a few days before he had ridden from
Gettysburg to Richmond, cheer after cheer following him along the way. Men, women and
children were at the roadside to welcome him
and hang garlands on his horse. He had been
the central figure in a scene so supreme that it
needed not victory to crown it with glory. Yet
'not the flowers of love nor the echo of the cannon's thunder, the grave duties nor the heavy
sorrows that were laid upon him, could so fill
his heart as to leave no room for the cry of suffering from an unknown child.ortunately, the Federals south of the line
were at that time worshipping exclusively at
the shrine of Mars. For them Cupid was absolutely dethroned. So much opposed were they
to our marriage and so insistent in their efforts
to induce my Soldier to pay them a prolonged
visit instead of wasting his time in wedding
frivolities that it peeniie necessary for me to

As by that time the food supply of the South
was reduced to narrow limits, salt being pro-
eured by digging up and boiling the earth from
under the smokehouses, browned sweet potatoes
cut into bits and toasted serving for coffee, and
lumps of sugar being sold at high prices for
the hospital fund, it might be thought that our
prospect of finding a banquet awaiting us in
Richmond was not brilliant. But friends and
relations of my Soldier had exerted themselves
to do him honor, and the result was such as had
not been seen in Virginia for many a day. It
was sora season and so generous was the
supply that the feast was afterward known
as the "wedding sora-supper." The birds had
been killed at night with paddles, for the South
was not wasting her small store of ammunition
on sora with so many more important targets
in sight. The birds, killed at Curl's Neck on

dof my bonnets was made of the lacy
ing that grows on the inside of a gourd, called
iy dish-eloth bonnet because the soft fabric
was used also for the less ornamental kitchen
purpose. In the absence of the more widely
known varieties of millinery I used the silky
milkweed balls for white roses and made
bunches of grapes from picked cotton covered
with fleek-skin and tinted. A bonnet of gray
straw, plaited and dyed by the servants, poke-
shaped and with pink roses inside the brim, was
especially becoming. My bridal present from
ivy pastor's wife was a very wide collar of
tatting and embroidery.
The wedding robe left nothing to be desired,
for it was of white satin and exquisite shimmering lace, made at a center of fashion. In passing I may remark that the possession of a real
wedding dress, new and stylish, was a distinction that carried with it a sense of obligation
to the community at large, and my bridal gown
graced a number of weddings afteAmong the many who helped to make iy life
happy in Petersburg was Major Charles Pickett, the General's Assistant Adjutant General
(the "Little Major," as he was affectionately
called by the soldiers). When my Soldier introduced him to me as his "little brother" he
immediately became my "little brother," too,
and thus he was in my life and my heart through
all the years that he remained on earth. He
walked slightly lame from a wound received at
Frazier's Farm. So anxious was he to get into
the fight that he disobeyed orders to report for
staff duty in Richmond and went into the battle
instead. When he was shot he begged his comrades not to carry him off the field but to leave
him his flag that he might die under its folds.
But he lived through what was known among
the men as "the battle the little Major fought
down at Frazier's Farm," and thus I came into
possession of "my little brother." Soon afterward he married Miss Elizabeth Smith of Washington, and brought us a dear sister who was
my companion in the rare sunshine and the
many storms of war.
All this region was historic and held thrilling
memories of the battles of bygone days. As we
rode over the ground we talked of the old-time
conflicts and my Soldier said that he would have
been glad to be in all wars that were for a just
cause. I had been taught that the Mexican war
was without such justification, and asked his
opinion.
"At West Point," he replied, "some of us
were reprimanded for expressing a doubt of itsjustice. I was one of them. After we were
in we had to fight it out and as it must be done
I wanted to do my share."
It was while my Soldier was stationed at
Petersburg that the expedition to North Carolina was projected, involving Newbern and
Plymouth. The military history of the movement is given in "Pickett and His Men," but
there are certain personal features of the expedition which have been recorded in my memory,
for I would not be left behind when the journey
to the old North State was made. I went as
far as the house of a friend on the Newbern
road.
The night was bleak and frigid; we were nearing our stopping place. My Soldier, always
solicitous for his men, was discussing with his
staff the discomfort to which they would be
subjected and the impossibility of alleviating
their suffering.
"Poor fellows!" he said. "They will be almost frozen and no wood, and General Lee will
not allow us to burn even a single rail. There
will be the devil to pay and I powerless to help."
Observing that I had awakened and heard
his last remark he turned reprovingly to Captain Bright, saying:
"Bright, how dare you use that gentleman's
name in the presence of my wife?""Beg your pardon, Sister,' said Captain
Bright, "I thought you were asleep."
Whatever relation my Soldier might bear to
his staff officers, I was always ''Sister."'
"Don't you think I know your voice, my dear,
from Captain Bright's?" I inquired.
"No, little one, you could not possibly know
my voice in connection with such words, and
you could not think that I would use such language as Bright uses."

Had it not been for the versatile imagination
of Colonel Floweree, the Ananias of the Seventh
Virginia Regiment, my Soldier and I would
probably have fared badly. The hotel was impossible and the community was of Union sentiment. In our connection with the Southern
Army we could expect no toleration. In this
dilemma Colonel Floweree undertook to grapple
with the situation. He learned that the most
beautiful and luxurious home in the village was
owned by an old Baptist, a power in the chureh
and in the community, who was known to be not
unwilling to make an occasional sacrifice of po-litical opinions to religious fraternity. Colonel
'loweree called upon the good brother and, with
an intonation that he could have learned nowhere but from the pious and hardshell Baptists of that region and period, said:
"My dear Brother, I know what a good Baptist you are and how ready you are to help all
your brethren in the Lord. I have my good
General, Brother Pickett, out here with his dear
pious wife, Sister Pickett, both good Baptists,
and I beg you to extend to them the hospitality
of your home and entertain them as best you
can for the sake of brotherly love."
"If I do," said the old man hesitatingly, "the
Yankees may burn my house; but I must take
the chances, I cannot let my brethren suffer.
Yes, let the good brother and sister come in and
share what I have."
We were received with fraternal hospitality,
our host shaking hands with us solemnly, saying, "How do you do, Brother Pickett? How
are you, Sister Pickett?" in a voice that invested
us with the sanctity of the church.
I was interested to observe that our host had
but one eye, his wife was cross-eyed, and their
daughter was cock-eyed. These optical phenomena were afterward scientifically explained by
our Baptist brother.
"T was engaged to a cross-eyed girl," he said,"and my people objected to the marriage. I
was about to give it up when one day 1 was
eutting wood and the end of the stick flew up
and hit me in the eye and put it out. It was
the judgment of the Lord and I repented and
married my cross-eyed girl. Then when our
girl was born the hand of the accusing angel
touched her and she was ecoek-eyed to keep me
in mind of my sin."
Though my Soldier had been ordered a few
days before to report to the Army of Northern
Virginia, he could not leave Petersburg to destruction. In defiance of orders he remained
in the beleaguered city. The day after the at-tack a part of the South Carolina brigade came
in and, being placed at Walthall Junction, about
six miles from Petersburg, drove back Butler's
advance column. Wise's Virginia brigade arrived on the seventh and was sent toward City
Point. Then three brigades of Pickett's division
began coming in as fast as the crippled express could bring them, and we had eleven
pieces of artillery.
We women carried the dispatehes, cooked the
food and took it to the men at the guns. At
train time we would go to the station and send
up cheer after cheer of weleome, hoping to blind
the Federals to the fact that the cars, returning
from their short trip to the country, brought in
only the half-starved railroad men. The roar
of cannon and the shrieks of shot and_ shell
filled our ears day and night. Durmg the entire week, until Petersburg was safe and General Grant bad sent his famous telegram to Mr.
Lincoln, "Pickett has bottled up Butler at
Petersburg,' my Soldier scarcely slept, and I
saw him only when I carried to him on the lines
a dispatch or his bread and soup and coffee.
This telegram so angered Butler that he came
up the James River, out of the line of battle,
at great expense to the United States Government, and sacked and burned my Soldier's beautiful ancestral home.The city council of Petersburg voted a resolution of thanks to my Soldier for his brave defense of the city. The people wished to express
their gratitude by a gift to me. It was impossible to buy a service of silver, so each
brought a fork, a salt-spoon, a pitcher, as the
case might be, until more than a thousand pieces
were given to me. One woman, having no silver
because she had been compelled to sell her
household service, brought a pretty giltbordered cup. The gifts of affection were of far
greater value to me than the most elegant and
eostly new set of silver could have been and
were carefully cherished until, in the fire which
marked the surrender of Richmond, they, with
all my bridal presents and everything of value,
were burned im the warehouse in Richmond
where they had been placed for safe-keeping.

At the Howlett House not all our evenings
were given over to pleasure. The Federals had
a theory that business should come first, and
would thrust their views upon us at inopportune
times, frequently arousing us from slumber.
These nocturnal attacks were veritable scenes
from the Inferno displayed against the black
curtain of night—-swords flashing through the
darkness, guns thundering across the silence
that had brooded over the earth, weapons clashing, the roar of orders sweeping over the field—
all the demoniae sounds of battle crashing
through a blackness that enshrouded our world.
He who has looked upon such a scene needs no
fiend of darkness to roll back for him the heavy
curtain that hides the world of demons. Even
the bravest of the brave doubted their courage
in a night attack.
After one of these encounters when the
wounded were brought in I saw my Soldier stop
beside two of them, one a Federal and the other
a Confederate. Pointing to the northern soldier he said: .
"Please attend first to our guest, doctor."
Then he gave his handkerchief to serve as atourniquet to stop the bleeding of the Federal
soldier's wound,
It was at the Bermuda Hundred line that I
first saw General Grant. My Soldier and I were
riding along looking at the Federal gunboats
and monitors not more than a few hundred
yards from our headquarters when I saw a puff
of smoke drifting, scattering, a mere shadow
as it floated higher and was lost against the
blue sky.
"Look, look!' I exclaimed. "Isn't that beautiful?"
"Dangerously beautiful. It is from a shell.
The enemy are firing over there. Come, dear;
whip up your horse and let me get you out
of this as soon as I can."
"No, indeed," I said. "I'm not a bit afraid,
and if I were do you think I would let Pickett's
men see me run?"
"Oome, dear, please! You are in danger,
useless danger, and that is not bravery."
The soldiers did not seem to agree with him,
for Corse's Brigade sent up cheer after cheer
as we passed. Captain Smith, just then riding
across the field, stopped to speak to us.
"The Federals are testing some guns, I think,
for the entertainment of visitors," he explained,
"and are not firing at us. They are over thereto the right of that oak." He handed us hisfield glass. 'Mrs. Grant is standing between
those two short, stout men. The one at the left
with a cigar in his mouth is Grant. The shorter,
stouter one on the right is Ingalls, Grant's
Quartermaster-General."
"Yes, that's Rufus. See him laugh, the old
rascal!' said my Soldier, a glint of the old-
time affection shining in his eyes and vibrating
in his voice. He, Grant and Ingalls were old
friends, having been comrades in Mexico and
the West. "But come, let's ride on."
"Ves," said Captain Smith, "it is not safe
here. J would take Mrs. Pickett away. Turn
to the left there into that clump of trees."
"Unfortunately, Captain, Mrs. Pickett outranks me; she will not go."
"Permit me, please, Mrs. Pickett, to add my
entreaties to those of the General. It really
is not safe here."
"Let me get down and try our guns, too, and
then I'll go," I answered.
"Not for the world," exclaimed my Soldier.
"They are not shooting at us. Mrs. Grant is
so kind-hearted that she would not approve of
their shooting in this direction if she thought
it would interrupt our morning ride. Besides,
she is exceedingly cross-eyed and does not know
directions."
The Captain saluted my Soldier, lifted hishat to me, suggestively pointed to the grove
on our left and rode away. I watched him, admiring his fine horsemanship. Beginning to
fee] remorseful for my obstinate resistance to
his appeal I was about to turn off to the safe
path when one of the aimless cannon balls swept
across the field and I saw the Captain's horse
careering madly along bearing a headless body.
Impulsively I sprang from my horse and ran
and picked up the poor head, and I solemnly
believe that the dying eyes looked their
thanks as the last glimmering of life flickered
out. Those pathetically grateful eyes have
looked at me many times through the mists
of vanished years and with them has come
the booming of the guns that threw black
bars across the sunshine of that far away
morning.
The memory of General Grant often came tome afterward associated with that awful sight
following my first view of him across the water
where he stood peacefully smoking on the slope.
The fact that he remembered the old friendship
with my Soldier was impressed upon me many
times after my view of him through field
glasses.
Among the friends whom I often met at this
station was General Robert E, Lee. It has
been said that our Commanding General neverknew or cared what he ate, and it is true that he
did not, in comparison with the welfare of his
soldiers. Once when he and his staff lunched
with us I gave them one of our famous Brunswick stews, made of chicken, a slice of pork,
corn, tomatoes and Lima beans, with bay-leaf
and onion seasoning, and cooked slowly. It
was particularly good this day, as I had re-
eeived a gift of some smuggled salt and could
afford to use it lavishly, and General Lee said
the stew was the most delicious thing he had
ever tasted. I had just made some walnut
pickles of which I was very proud. He praised
them and told me that in his house he had them
many years old and that the "older they became
the better they were."
"But, you know," he said, "I never eat anything good without thinking of the soldiers and
their privations."
One evening in Richmond my Soldier and I
were invited to spend the evening with Senator
and Mrs. Clement C. Clay, and while there
General Lee called. We had ice cream made of
buttermilk and sweetened with sorghum, and
lemonade made with lemons from the conservatory of our hostess. She remarked that she
had been saving those lemons for the soldiers
in the hospital but that she had more which she
would give to them. "If you will be sure notto forget the soldiers," said General Lee, "I
will enjoy this lemonade."
es VT sympathetic and warm-hearted, our
General had a natural dignity of manner which,
though inspiring confidence, interposed a veil of
reserve between him and even his warmest
admirers. Years after the war one of my
friends who had been an officer in the Army of
Northern Virginia, first under General Joe
Johnston and then under General Lee, said tome:

SS nly they shook hands and General Lee
and his companions galloped off, my Soldier
and I standing in the doorway listening.
"Hear the horses' hoofs saying, 'Blood-blood,
Blood-blood,' " said T.
'So they do, little one," answered my Soldier.
"Strange—-strange I had not thought of that
before."
We turned to the map on the floor and rolled
up the ways to go and prayed for a miracle to
bring success.Ii were near the Federal lines and the
inen on the opposing sides enjoyed
friendly chats with each other,
swapped jokes, bartered tobacco for coffee and
exchanged newspapers.
The Federals kept their cattle in a stockade
in the rear of their camp. Early one morning
they were surprised to see Confederate soldiers
running along the line in a manner suggestive
of a drove of highly excited cows.
"What's the matter with you, Johnnies, over
there?" came the query across the lines. "Are
you all crazy?"
The only answer was a vociferous and long-
drawn out chorus of "Moo-0-0! Moo-o-o!
Moo-o-0 !"
Disgusted with the pertinaceous lunacy of
their foes the blue-coats gave up the conundrum.
A little while later the problem was solved. In
the night General J. E. B. Stuart with some
of his men had circled the eamp and driven off
all the Federal cattle, and the "Moo!" of the
Confederates was a graphic announcement to
the victims of their loss. For a time the
"Johnnies" fared sumptuously on steak and
roast while the "Yanks" were compelled to
forage till they could lay in a new supply of livestock.
The red flag of the politicians never wholly
divided the hearts of the soldiers into hostile
eamps. Not only did the West Pointers retain
the comradeship of the old Army days, but the
enlisted men shared the friendly sentiment.
In the summer of '63 the Confederate and
Federal soldiers doing duty on opposite banks
of the Black Water River in Virginia were wont
to divert themselves by trading with each other.
They had built for their traffic a miniature fleet
of rudely but ingeniously earved boats. One
of these little vessels would be taken up stream,
the current of which was seldom strong, and
with rudder fixed it would go down the river
with its cargo of sugar and coffee wrapped in
the latest newspaper and stored in the scooped
deck; and would be grappled and hauled in by
the sentry on the opposite side. Back the same
trusty little carrier dove would come, laden with
plugs of tobacco, wrapped likewise in the latest
paper on that side. Cheers and shouts fromboth lines would greet each cargo as it touched
the shore.
One morning a short time after the battle of
Gettysburg the Confederates anxiously awaited
the return of their little craft. It came and
was enthusiastically received, but to their surprise, no answering shout went up from the
opposite shore on the landing of the boat. The
cargo, much to their disappointment, was
wrapped in brown paper.
"Well, we have whipped them Yanks again
as sure as guns," they argued sympathetically
in explanation of the silence and the brown
paper. The vessel was sent back and on the
paper in which the cargo was wrapped were
these words:
"We-all are so sorry for you-all Yanks, but we
won't crow loud, so send along the paper."
The boat returned with the paper, on the margin of which was written:
"Twas sech darned infernal hard luck in
the papers for you Rebs we was 'feared they'd
sink the coffee."
In the old Army my Soldier had a dear comrade, at this time a General in the Army of the
Potomac. His brother had the misfortune to be
captured and put into Libby prison and, in
memory of the old friendship, my Soldier secured his release and took him as a guest intoour home, the old Pickett mansion in Richmond.
In an unaccountable moment of indiscretion he
wrote a letter in which he said that the Confederacy was on its last legs, stating that he was
in a home of wealth, where there was a house
full of servants, and in the morning the basket
was sent to market packed full of money and
brought back only half full of provisions. This
letter fell into the hands of Judge Ould, Commissioner of exchange of prisoners, who immediately reported it and the offending writer
was returned to prison. My Soldier's sympathy
was not cooled by this unhappy incident, and
later he secured permission for me to go to the
prison at will and take whatever I could of our
seanty store that would be a help or comfort
to him-—-beaten biseuit, eggs, milk or fruit.
However unpromising the outlook might be I
always managed to find something for him.
Every week when I would take him clean linen
the other prisoners would cut dice for that
which he left off. Of more value than anything
else was the gourd of soft soap which I carried
to him, for we had no salt to make hard soap.
I think he cared more for the human interest
that I brought from outdoor life, the glint of
sunshine, however dark my own heart might
be.
"Tt was thus that I saw the inside of Libbyager:
It had been many months since the authorities
of the North had set a rigid bar against the
exchange of prisoners, involving the reinforcement of the Confederate Army. It was impossible for the South to replace her captured men,
while the Federal Army could be easily kept in
full foree by new recruits. Mr. Davis had
vainly pleaded for exchange on the field. He
had sent two Federal prisoners to Washington
to represent our condition and the impossibility
of feeding prisoners in addition to trying to
keep our own soldiers from starvation. The
stern necessities of war had prevailed against
him. The prisoners themselves had given assent to the sad fate that was to be theirs. They
had offered their lives for their country. What
mattered it whether the supreme sacrifice was
accepted in the swift glory of the battle flash
or in the long dreary darkness of a hopeless imprisonment.
In my visits to the prison I met and knew
other unfortunate ones and am thankful that I
was able to minister to some of them. Among
my son's and my own best friends in after years
were some whom I first met in that awful, woeful place.
are; don't you remember me?"
"Yes," I said, "I remember; of course, I remember. You are the poor wounded boy the
prisoners used to eall Little Willie Sourmilk,
Little Kentuck, Baby Blue, ete."
"Yes; that's me, and, oh, I am so glad that
I have found you at last. Do you know that
I have prayed to God every night that I might,
and, lady, you never will know what a benediction your visits were to old Libby, and me—
oh, you saved my life; I never can forget that
first day. It was in June. The roses were in
bloom, and such roses! A great bunch was
lving on the top of your basket. I was
stretched out on the table near the barred window trying to think of old Kentucky and forget
my wounds when I heard a voice say, 'Little
fellow, would you like to have a beaten biscuit
and a glass of buttermilk? 'Would I? Oh,
God, would I?' I said. When you went away
you left half the roses on my pillow, and how
I watched for your visits after that. I never
knew your name, never knew how to find you.
To us prisoners you were the Rose Lady."
His tears had washed off the kiss on my hand
and I was back again, looking into the wild,
harrowing, despairing faces in the dismal tobacco-warehouse prison, all regardless of my
host and hostess and the surrounding guests.
"Well, Pll be dogged, Jane," said Mr. Tuckerto his dear little wife. "What do you think of
this? I always did believe every word of those
Ali Baba and Forty Thieves and Magic Lantern
tales and this proves them, for they are not a
bit stranger than this sour buttermilk story."
The stranger was Colonel William UH. Low-
dermilk, of Anglim's Bookstore. When later I
lost all my worldly goods and was appointed
to a desk in the Pension Office, Colonel Lowder-
milk, then of the firm of Lowdermilk & Company, Book-Dealers, wrote to the Commissioner
of Pensions a strong letter of commendation, in
which he told in warmest terms of my care of
himself and other Union soldiers in Libby
prison, and asked that every courtesy and consideration be shown to me for al] time and in
every possible way, in sacred memory of the
boys in Libby. Throughout his life afterward
he was a devoted, loyal friend to me and mine.
. still have the photograph of him taken in
jeral uniform before he was captured.ILE close of the stormy career of the Con-
ite federacy was marked in blood by the
battle of Five Forks. The end was at
hand.
The Army had subsisted on corn for many
days. As my Soldier was riding to Sailor's
Creck a woman ran out of a house by the roadside and handed him a luncheon wrapped in
paper. Passing on, he saw a man lying behind
a log; a deserter, he supposed. What did it
matter? The poor fellows had fought long
enough and hard enough to earn the right to go
home. He spoke to the man, who looked up,
revealing a boyish face. He was thin and pale,
searcely more than a child.
"\re you wounded, my boy?" asked my Soldier.
"No, General, I am starving, sir," he replied.
"T could not keep up any longer and lay down
here to die. I couldn't help it, Marse George."
"Here, take this," said my Soldier. "Hat it,
and when you are rested and have slept go back
home."
The soldier took the luncheon gratefully.
"No, Marse George," he answered, "if I get
strength to go on I'll follow you and Marse Robert to the last."
He did follow to the last, being killed a few
days later at Sailor's Creek, where the parting
salute was fired over the grave of the Confederacy.
'"They failed and fell, who bade the sun in heaven to
stand,
We failed and fell, who set our bars against the
progress of the stars,
And stayed the mareh of Motherland."'
Many months before the farewell shot, when
some one applied to President Lincoln for a
pass to go into Richmond, he gravely replied:
"T don't know about that; I have given passes
to about two hundred and fifty thousand men
during the last two years to go to Richmond,
and not one of them has got there yet."
Some of those passes had been used and their
bearer had arrived at last, having made the
slowest time on record since the first camel
bore the pioneer traveler over an Oriental desert. The queen city of the South had fallen.The story of the great nation that had hovered
upon the horizon of our visions had been written
out to its last sorrowful word.
On the morning of Sunday, April 2, in the
holy ealn of St. Paul's Church, we had assembled to ask the great Father of Heaven and
earth to guard our loved ones and give victory
to the cause so dear to us. Suddenly the glorious sunlight was dimmed by the heavy cloud
of disappointment, and the peace of God was
broken by the deep-voiced bells tolling the
death-knell of our hopes.
There was mad haste to flee from the doomed
city. President Davis and his Cabinet officers
were in the church, and to them the news first
came. They hurried to the State House to se-
eure the Confederate archives and retreat with
them to some place of safety.
Fear and dread fell over us all. We were
cut off from our friends and communication
with them was impossible. Our soldiers might
have fallen into the hands of the enemy—we
knew not. They might have poured out their
life-blood on the battlefield—we knew not. In
our helpless deserted condition all the world
seemed to have been struck with sudden darkness.
The records having been secured, an order
was issued to General Ewell to destroy the
'public buildmgs. The one thing which could
intensify the horrors of our position—fire—was
added to our calamities. General J. C. Breckenridge, our Secretary of War, with a wider
humanity and a deeper sense of the rights of
our people, tried in vain to have this order
ecountermanded, knowing that its execution
could in no way injure or impede the victorious
army, while it would result im the ruin of many
of our own people. The order was ae outwith even greater Scope! AS

iremen dared not hake any effort to subdue
the flames, fearing an attack from the soldiers who had executed the order to burn the
buildings.
Through the night the fire raged, the sea of
darkness rolled over the town, the crowds of
men, women and children went about the streets
Jaden with what plunder they could rescue from
the flames. 'The drunken rabble shattered the
plate-glass windows of the stores and wrecked
everything upon which they could seize. The
populace had become a frenzied mob, and the

humanity, they had, by an early corner in the
market and by successful blockade running,
bought up all the available supplies with an
eye to future gain, while our soldiers and women and children were absolutely in rags, barefoot and starving. Not even war, with its horrors and helplessness, can divert such harpies
from thei r accustomed methods of aceumulatingwealth at the expense of those who have spent
their lives in less self-seeking ways.
About nine o'clock Monday morning a series
of terrifie explosions startled our ears, inured
as they were to every variety of painful sounds.

the old plate-glass mirrors built into the walls

While the flames were raging the colored
troops of General Weitzel, who had been stationed on the north side of the James a few
miles from Richmond, entered the city. As I
saw their black faces shining through the gloom
of the smoke-shrouded town I could not helpthinking that they added the one feature needed,
if any there were, to complete the demoniacal
character of the scene. They were the first
colored troops I had ever seen, and the weird
effect produced by their black faces in that infernal environment was indelibly impressed
upon my mind,
General Weitzel sent Major E. E. Graves, of
his staff, and Major A. H. Stevens, of the
Fourth Massachusetts Cavalry, at the head of
a hundred mounted men, to reconnoiter the
Richmond roads and works. At the fortifications beyond the junction of the Osborne turnpike and New Market road they were met by a
flag of truce waved from a dilapidated, oldfashioned carriage drawn by a pair of skeleton-like
horses. The truce party consisted of the Mayor
of Richmond, Colonel Mayo; Judge Meredith, of
the Supreme Court; Mr. James Lyons, one of
our most eminent lawyers, and a fourth, whom
I do not now recall.
The carriage was probably in the early part
of the century what might have been called, if
the modern classic style of phraseology had
prevailed at that time, a "tony rig." At the
period of which I write it had made so many
journeys over the famous Virginia roads that
it had become a sepulehral wreck of its former
self,There may have been a time when the reminiscences of animals that dragged out from the
burning Capital the ruins of the stately chariot
were a span of gay and gallant steeds, arching
their necks in graceful pride, champing their
bits in scorn of the idea that harness made by
man could trammel their lofty spirits, pawing
the earth in disdain of its commonplace coarseness. If so, the lapse of years and an extended
term of Confederate fare had reduced those
noble ecoursers to shambling memories.
What of it? The chariot of state might be
the wreck of former grandeur, the horses might
be the dimmest of recollections, but was not Mr.
Lyons still Mr. Lyons—in all circumstances, the
most dignified member of Old Dominion aristocracy? The Mayor turned over the keys of
the city and in recognition of the pre-eminence
of Mr. Lyons, deputed to him the performance
of further ceremonies. With cold and stately
formality Mr. Lyons "had the honor" to introduce his companions and to present a paper on
which was inscribed:
''Tt is proper to formally surrender to the Federal
authorities the City of Richmond, hitherto Capital of
the Confederate States of America, and the defenses
protecting it.''
Major Stevens courteously accepted the surrender on behalf of his Commanding General,to whom the document was transmitted, and
proceeded to reduce the newly acquired property to possession by fighting the flames which
disputed ownership with him.
Having utilized to good effect what little remnant of the fire department he could find, Major
Stevens ordered the Stars and Stripes to be
raised over the Capitol. Two soldiers of the
Fourth Massachusetts Cavalry, one from Company E and one from Company H, mounted to
the summit of the Capitol, and in a few moments, for the first time in more than four years,
the National Flag fluttered unmolested in the
breezes of the South. The stars of the Union
were saluted, while our "warrior's Banner took
its flight to meet the warrior's soul."
That flag which almost a century before had
risen from the clouds of war, like a star gleaming out through the darkness of a stormy night,
with its design accredited to both Washington
and John Adams, was raised over Virginia by
Massachusetts, in place of the one whose kinship and likeness to the old banner had never
been entirely destroyed.
In March, 1861, the Confederate Congress
adopted the Stars and Bars—three horizontal
bars of equal width, the middle one white, the
others red, with a blue union of nine stars in a
circle. This was so like the National Flag as to cause confusion. In 1863 this flag was
replaced by a banner with a white field, having the battle-flag (a red field charged with
a blue saltier on which were thirteen stars)
for a union. It was feared that this might
be mistaken for a flag of truce, and was
changed by covering the outer half of the
field with a vertical red bar. This was finally
adopted as the flag of the Confederate States
of America.
The day after the fire there was a rap at our
door. The servants had all run away. The
city was full of northern troops, and my environment had not taught me to love them.
With my baby on my arm I answered the knock,
opened the door and looked up at a tall, gaunt,
sad-faced man in ill fitting clothes, who asked
with the accent of the North:
"Ts this George Pickett's place?"
"This is General Pickett's home, sir," I replied, "but he is not here."
"I know that, ma'am, I know where George
Pickett is,' he answered, "but I just wanted tosee the place. Down in old Quincy, Illinois, where
I used to hear George Pickett whistle the songs
of Virginia in his bird-like notes, I have heard
him describe his home till in spirit I have been
here many a time. I have smelled the multi-
flora roses and the Lady Bankshire roses and
the golden cluster roses and those great cabbage
roses, I have seen the borders of hyacinths in
the springtime and the lilies-of-the-valley blooming in the chimney corner, the beds of violets,
the rows of beehives and the lily-beds that the
bees knew were theirs, had been planted just
for them. I have stood under the arbor and
gathered those strange green looking grapes
that are like the Virginia aristocracy, growing
each one on its own individual stem. I think
he called them scuppernongs. I have sat on
that back porch and listened to the music as his
sister Virginia, of whom he was so proud, sang
in that glorious voice he told me about, and I
have swung in this old swing here while the
moon and I watched and waited for the old eat
to die. So I wanted to see the place."
I, listening, wondered who he could be, till he
finished and then he said:
"J. am Abraham Lincoln."
"The President!" I gasped.
"No—no,—just Abraham Lincoln; George
Pickett's old friend.""I am George Pickett's wife and this is his
baby," was all I could say.
The baby reached out his arms and Mr. Lincoln took him, a look of tenderness almost divine
glorifying that sad face. I have never seen
that expression on any other face. My little
one opened his mouth and insisted upon giving his father's friend a dewy baby kiss. Ashe handed my baby back to me Mr. Lincoln
shook his long hand at him and said:
"Tell your father, the rascal, that 1 could
almost forgive him anything for the sake of
those bright eves and that baby kiss."
The tones of his deep voice touched all the
chords of life to music, and I marveled no more
at my Soldier's love for him even through all
the bitterness of the years. He turned and
weut down the steps and out of my life forever,
but in my memory that wonderful voice, those
intensely human eyes, that strong, sad, tender
face have a perpetual abiding place. He seemed
io have a east in his eye that reminded me of
the glass eye of Mr. Davis, but as no one has
ever mentioned it in describing him it may be
that his likeness to Jefferson Davis made me
think so, yet T always see that look in his
pictures.
Among my treasured possessions are some
old letters, written by Mr. Lincoln when prac-ticing law in Springfield, to George Pickett, then
a cadet at West Point, where he was placed at
the request of Mr. Lincoln. The homely and
humorous philosophy of these letters, the honesty which breathes through them, the cheerful
outlook upon life, and the ready sympathy of
the experienced professional man with the boy
just on the threshold of life, looking down the
vista of the future to the flashing of swords and
the thunder of guns, all bring him before meas a friend,
I look beyond the description he once gave
of himself, "Height, six feet, four inches, nearly ;
lean in flesh, weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with
coarse black hair and gray eyes."
A free-hand sketch like that is easy, but my
memory fills the outlines with the subtle beauty
of soul, the sunny view of life, the deep, tender
sympathy that made up a face of infinite charm
which puzzled all artists but revealed itself to
the intuitions of a child, causing the babe to
raise its little arms to be taken up and its lips
to be kissed.
The ways of Abraham Lincoln and George
Pickett were widely separated for a time, but
were never so far apart that the old love
had not full sway. I marveled over it once,
but after my own picture of the man was filledout I wondered no more. I think no one who
knew and loved Lincoln could be estranged
from him, whatever tides of political hostility
-
One afternoon, as we were reading "Les Mis-
erables" upon the veranda, our attention was
distracted by a number of soldiers below who
were discussing the Emancipation Proclamation and saying all manner of discrediting
things about Mr. Lincoln, censuring him as ignorant and despotic, and bringing other unfounded accusations against him. After they
were gone my Soldier walked up and down the
veranda, whistling "When other friends are
'round thee." Presently, coming back, sitting
beside me and taking hold of my hand, he said:
"Years ago there was a very lonesome, dispirited, disappointed, heart-broken boy away off
in Quincy, Illinois. He had received letters,
not in envelopes as they come now, for that was
a long time ago when the letter made its own
envelope; paper was scarcer then than now, and
one had to be careful in opening the letter. It
was fastened with sealing wax and in breaking
the wax it often happened that a word was
broken off. He had opened three of those letters and found that four of his cousins had been
appointed to West Point, three from Virginia
and one from Kentucky, and he was compelledto study law, a subject which he did not like, but
which his family did and had chosen for him.
His uncle with whom he was studying had no
sympathy with his ambition to be a soldier and
his disappointment in not being of the fortunate
number.
"That night when this lonesome boy was leaning on the gate still brooding over his disappointment but obediently trying to memorize the
Rule in Shelley's Case a tall man, for whom he
was waiting, came up the street and asked,
'What is the matter? Holes in your pocket and
your marbles and knife all dropped out? 'Yes,'
said the boy, 'I have lost my knife and my marbles and there are big holes in my pockets.'
'Well,' replied the man, 'you must have strong
pockets like mine. I have marbles and a knife
but my pockets are so strong now that they do
not make holes in them, as they used to do.
Come, sit down on the grass and let's have a
game of mumble-de-peg. The man played so
badly on purpose that it was he who had to
mumble the peg, but his playmate insisted that
he should mumble it. 'No, you have been mumbling the peg all day, my boy. I want to keep
you from mumbling pegs.'
"The next morning the boy was awakened
by a handful of gravel thrown against the window. He looked out and saw his friend with
saddle-bags in his hand. 'Going up the road
a piece,' he called out. It took the man a longtime to go up the road and the boy waited for
him week after week to come down the road.
After a long time there came instead a letter
from which the following is an extract:
I never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a bad memory, is the worst enemy
a fellow can have. The fact is, truth is your truest
friend, no matter what the circumstances are. Notwithstanding this ecopy-book preamble, my boy, I am
inelined to suggest a little prudence on your part.
You see I have a congenital aversion to failure, and
the sudden announcement to your Uncle Andrew of
the suecess of your ''lamp-rubbing'' might possibly
prevent your passing the severe physical examination
to which you will be subjected in order to enter the
Military Academy. I should like to have a perfect
soldier eredited to dear old Illinois—no broken bones,
sealp wounds, ete. So I think perhaps it might be
wise to hand this letter from me in to your good uncle
through his room-window after he has had a comfortable dinner, and watch its effect from the top of the
pigeon-house.
"Tnelosed in this letter was one from Mr. John
G. Stuart, Representative in Congress of the
Third Illinois District, together with an appointment to West Point."My Soldier was silent for a moment, then continued:
"That man is the one we have just heard
maligned; the man to whom I, your Soldier,
owes his profession, the one to whom he is indebted for the garlands that were hung around
his horse all along the road as he came from
Gettysburg, the one whose honesty and courage
enabled your Soldier to defy the British fleet at
San Juan, and to whom he owes the gratitude of
the people of Petersburg who say that he saved
their town—that man was Abraham Lincoln."
Months afterward, when the awful news of
Lincoln's death came to us, my Soldier exclaimed:
"My God!. My God! The South has lost her
best friend and protector in this, her direst hour
rd?"turned o¥ Sent forme. "Now, remember, I shall
surely come back," he said. So, like Casabi-
anca, I waited, and not even "the flames that lit
the battle's wreck" should frighten me away.
General Breckenridge, our Secretary of War,
had, in his thoughtfulness, offered me an
opportunity of leaving the Confederate Capital,
but remembering that my Soldier had left me
there I obediently determined to remain until
he came or sent for me. Thanking the Secretary I said:
"T cannot go until the voice that bade me stay
calls me."
The days were filled with fear and anguish
unspeakable. The clock struck only midnight
hours for me.
Rumors of the death of my Soldier were
credited (I saw by the look on everybody's
face, though no word was said), and I would
not ask a question nor let anybody speak to me
of him lest an effort be made to prepare me for
the sad tidings. The last letter I had received
from him was dated the 30th of March, at
Hatcher's Run, the extreme right of the Confederate line, most of the letter being written
in Chinook, that 1 only might understand. It
contained the following paragraph:
Heavy rains; roads and streams almost impassable.
While General Lee was holding a conference with his
chiefs this morning a message came from General
Fitz Lee, stating that through a prisoner he had
learned that the Federal cavalry, fifteen thousand
strong, supported by heavy infantry, were at or near
Dinwiddie Court-House. This decided the General's
plans, and he has placed General Fitz Lee in command of the whole cavalry, Rosser's, W. H. F. Lee'sand his own, with orders to march upon Five Forks.
I am to support with my small force of artillery and
infantry this movement and I take command of the
whole force.
He wrote in full faith of a short separation,
saying that all would be well, that he would
surely return, imploring me not to listen to or
credit any rumors to the contrary, and urging
me in an added line to be brave and of goodcheer—to keep up a "skookum tum-tum." —(Chinook for "brave heart," always his last words tome in parting). This letter was brought tome by Jaccheri, a daring, fearless Italian in
my Soldier's employ as headquarters postmaster. He was sagacious and loyal, perfectly
devoted to the General and his cause, and was
trusted with letters of the strictest confidence
and greatest importance all through the war.
As I said before, our people were on the
verge of starvation. For weeks before we left
eamp the army had been living on rations of
corn aud beans, with "seasonings" of meat. The
game had been trapped and killed throughout
the whole country, and my breakfast that morning had consisted of a few beans cooked in
water, no salt, for salt had long been a luxury
in the Confederacy. All the old smokehouses
had been moved, that the earth might be dug
up and pulled down to recover the salt which
in the many years it had absorbed.
John Theophelas, my dear little brother, nine
years old, was a great comfort to me in these
days of trial. He had just brought my beans
and was lovingly coaxing me to eat them when
Jaccheri came, and a plate was filled for him.
After Jaccheri had finished his meager breakfast, seasoned with his adventures on the road,
swimming the river at one place carrying hisclothes in a bundle on his head, he said he must
go. I added a few lines to my diary, which I
always kept for my Soldier, and gave it to our
faithful letter-carrier to take back to him.
"Ina da days to come," said Jaccheri in his
soft Italian voice "ina all lands, no matter,
mucha people, mucha gloly, nadie money, no
matter, you find Jaccheri here—and here—"
first putting his hand over his heart and then
drawing from his boot and gracefully brandishing a shining blade. "Gooda-bye."
At the door he turned back, untied his cravat,
and wiggled out five pieces of money, three gold
dollars and two ninepences. He walked over
on tiptoe to where the baby was_ sleeping,
erossed himself and, kneeling by the eradle,
slipped into baby's little closed hand two of the
gold dollars and around his neck a much worn
and soiled seapula.
"Da mon—Confed—noa mucha good, noa now
mucha accountable—you mighta want some;
want her vely bad before you nota get her.
Gooda-bye, some moa."
Dear, faithful old Jaecheri, he would take no
refusal, so I let baby keep the money. I was
kneeling by the cradle erying and praying for
my Soldier and thanking God that he had so
good a friend as this poor camp postman, when
the door opened softly and Jaccheri looked in."I know you cly and so I come back to say
gooda-bye some moa, and God bless."
I was reading aloud lovingly and reverently
the torn words on the ragged red-flannel scapula which Jaecheri had given to baby: "Cease,
the heart of Jesus is with you," when the baby
opened his sweet eyes and crowed over the little
fortune which had come to him in his dreams,
the first gold he had ever seen. Just then my
little brother, who had gone downstairs with
Jaecheri, came rushing back, his eyes wide open,
all excitement, exclaiming:
"Sister! Sister! There's a Yankee downstairs! Come to see you, but don't you go; nde,
hide, sister! Ill stand by the door and he dare-
sent pass by me. Quick, sister, hide! He said
that he was one of brother George's friends, but
I believe he has killed brother George, and now
wants to kill you!"
In the light of the present day the terror of
the child seems almost exaggerated, but in those
days southern nurses kept children docile by
warning them that the Yankees would get them
if they did not behave, and the whole environment of childhood intensified the fear thus instilled.
"Oh, no, no, my child," I said reassuringly,
trying to soothe and calm him. "No, no; don't
be such a little coward, dear. If he is one ofyour brother George's friends he is mine, too,
and he would not hurt me. I am not in the
least afraid, and I will go down at once and
see him."
"Please don't go, sister, you might be killed
and I promised brother George to take care of
you."
"That's a sweet boy; take care of the baby,"
I said and, kissing them both, closed the door
behind me.
As I entered the parlor a tall, thin gentleman
with the sweetest of smiles and the kindest of
voices, dressed in the uniform of a United States
surgeon, arose and said as he bowed, holding
his hat against his breast, thus avoiding offering
me his hand:
"My name is George Suckley, madam. I am
one of George Pickett's friends, although, as
soldiers, we have been enemies in the field for
more than three years. That, however, does not
interfere with us when we are not on duty. I
have heard that you southern women are very
bitter, and I did not know how yon, his wife—
you are Pickett's wife, are you not, madam?—
would take a visit from me, but I came, nevertheless. Knowing and loving George Pickett as
I do, I knew he would appreciate my motive incoming."
"Your name is a very familiar one, Dr. Suck-ley," 1 said. "I have often heard the General
speak of you, and recall many stories of your
adventures—your love for bugs and beetles, for
all natural history, in facet." I wished him to
know that I remembered him and had not mistaken him for another, and also that I had
reason to wonder at seeing him in his present position. "He spoke of your having been
with him at Fort Bellingham Bay, and knowing how you felt when he left the old army,
he wondered at your remaining and going to the
rout"
"T am a surgeon in Grant's army," said Dr.
Suckley, proudly, ignoring and, by his manner,
almost resenting my reference to his former
sympathy with the South. "I love Pickett, and
came, as he would have come had our positions
been reversed, to see his wife and offer her my
services,"
I thanked this kind-hearted gentleman and
distinguished officer, but was too bitter to accept
the smallest courtesy at his hands, even in my
husband's name and offered for love's sake—so
hitter that suffering was preferable to such
obligation. He bowed and was going, when I
said:
"Doctor, is there any news of the army?—
ours, I mean."
"The war is over, madam. You have my
address, if you should ehange your mind and
will show me how I can serve you."
He bowed and left. He, too, had heard that
my Soldier had been killed, and believed it, and
] hated him worse because of his belief.
On the evening of the 3d of April I was walking the floor. Baby was asleep and my little
brother was trotting behind me, when I heard
from the street:
"Grand vietory at Five Forks! Pickett killed
and his whole division captured."
It seemed very strange to me that in the
streets of Richmond, his old home, the Capital
of the Confederacy, the death of Pickett and the
capture of his whole division should be heralded
as a "grand victory." How great a change had
come in so short a time! Even the newsboys
had apparently gone over to the enemy.
"isn't so, sister, 'tisn't so! Don't you be-
heve him!" said my little brother, catching my
dress and shaking it. Then running to the window in his excitement, he called out:
"Hush, sir; hush! hush this minute, hallooing
your big stories out loud and scaring everybody
to death. Id like to stick those five forks
through your old black gizzard, for you haven't
got any heart, I know. Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, you good-for-nothing old scalawag,
you! There ain't a word of truth in brotherGeorge being killed, and you know it, you old
thing! Ill go down and smash his mouth for
him and kick him to death for searing you so, my
poor sister, 'deed I would; but it isn't so, my
sister. You trust in the Lord. I know brother
George is not killed, for he said he wouldn't get
killed."
"No, it is not so. You are right, my darling.
Your brother George is not killed,' I said.
"Ves, he will come back! he will come back! He
said he would, and he will."
Thus I spoke and believed, for my Soldier
had never broken a promise. The days came
and the days went and the sun rose each morning with an auroral glow of hope in its golden
heart. When twilight drifted out from the
forest shadows, the sun went down in a sea of
erimson fire that burned out my dream of happiness. Then night fell and the world and my
heart were wrapped in darkness.NE morning I had mechanically dressed
baby George and had taken him to the
window to hear the spring sounds and
breathe the spring balm and eatch the sunshine's
dripping gold wreathing the top of the quivering blossoms of the magnolia and tulip-trees.
It was the time when the orchestra of the
year is in perfect accord, when all the world is
vocal, when the birds sing of love, the buds and
blossoms of joy, the grains and grasses of hope
and faith, and when each rustle of wind makes
a chime of vital resonance.
Through the quiver and curl of leaves and
perfume of flowers and soft undertone of dawn-
winds came the words, "Whoa, Lucey; whoa,
little girl!"
Oh, those tones, those words, that voice
thrilled my heart so that I wonder it did not
burst from very gladness! Such joy, such
gratitude as flooded my soul only the Giver of
all good can know! All the privation and
starvation and blood-stains of the past four
years, all the woes and trials, griefs and fears,
of those last dreadful days were swept away
by those blessed, precious' words, "Whoa,
Luey!" spoken in my husband's tender tones
to his horse.
I could not wait to go down stairs in the
regular way; it was too slow. So I slid down
the bannisters with my baby in my arms and
ran out upon the porch just as my Soldier came
around the rosebushes that Mr. Lincoln had
described, and which had just budded out. Baby
and I were both in my Soldier's arms almost
before Lucy had been given into the hands of
the hostler. I do not know how to describe the
peace, the bliss of that moment—it is too deep
and too sacred to be translated into words. I
think that it is akin to the feeling that will come
to me in the hereafter, when I have gone through
all these dark days of privation and of starvation of heart and soul here, victorious, and at
last am safe within the golden gates and, waiting, and listening, shall hear again the voice
that said, "Whoa, Lucy!" here, bidding me welcome there as I weleomed him after the perilous
waiting.ome

little town of Chuckatuck wasOn the afternoon of the second day after my
Soldier's return, while we were trying to plan
a way to go, my little brother Johnny came
running in, saying:
"Sister, I saw riding by the door just now
that same Yankee who came here to see you the
other day, and who said he was brother George's
friend. Te knew me and asked how you were,
and how's the baby."
"Oh, I forgot; I must let you know all about
it,' I said, and told my Soldier of the visitor
who had called before he came back. When I
had finished his gray eyes filled with tears and
looking at the card he said tenderly:
"Dear old Suckley—dear old fellow—so
true!"
I stooped and took my Soldier's head in both
my hands, and raising it up gazed searchingly
into his earnest, loving eyes to see how he couldpossibly speak so affectionately of a Yankee.
"You, too, have that same kind of 'off-duty'
feeling that this Yankee doctor spoke of having," I said with surprise, and rather disrespectfully for me, I am afraid.
"T must find the dear old fellow," my Soldier
said, graciously overlooking my smallness of
spirit. Excusing himself and taking leave of
baby and me, he went out at once. In a little
while he returned, saying:
"Tt is very fortunate for us, little one, that
I went out when I did. Suekley goes down the
river to-morrow to Norfolk in the surgeogeneral's steamer, and he has kindly invited us to
go with him, dear old big-hearted bug-catcher!
Come, let us lose no time. Let us hurry and
get our little traps together and be ready. We
will not say anything about our plans to anyone
till to-morrow morning, when we can announce
our intentions and say our good-byes simultaneously."
Not only had this Yankee officer, in his "off-
duty" feeling for my Soldier, kindly volunteered
to transport us to our home, but to carry our
trunks and horses, in faet, all we had, which,
alas! was very, very little. Most of our worldly
possessions—all of our bridal presents, linen,
library, pictures, silver, furniture, harp, piano,
china, everything exeept a few clothes——hadbeen stored at Kent, Payne & Company's, and
had been burned in the awful fire the night of
the evacuation of Richmond.
The General's staff had, one by one, come in
during the day from field and camp, and all
breakfasted with us for the last time next morning in the old Pickett home. I observed that
each wore a blue strip tied like a sash about
the waist. It was the old headquarters flag,
they explained, the flag of Virginia, saved from
surrender and torn into strips by my Soldier
to be kept in remembrance. By our door was
a rose-bush full of white bloom called, because
of its hardihood and early blossoming, the
Frost-Rose. It had been planted by my Soldier's mother. He broke off some of the buds,
put one in my hair and one in the button-hole
of each of his officers. Then for the first time
tears came, and the men who had been eloser
than brothers for four long years clasped hands
in silence and parted.
The second social parting was sad, too, for
they had taken me, "the child wife," into their
lives twenty months before and they all loved
me and called me "Sister." Their pride in each
other and in their command, the perils that together they had endured, the varied experiences
of good times and bad, had bound them together
in links stronger than steel.In spite of the partings, the loss of our cause,
our disappointment and poverty, there was a
sweet, restful, peaceful feeling of thankfulness
in my heart and gratitude because the war was
over, my husband had been spared and belonged
now only to me; we were going home together,
free from intrusion, to live our own lives.ILE next morning Dr. Suckley called in his
headquarters ambulance to take us to the
steamer. Just at the close of breakfast
we had announced our intention of going.
There was to be a sudden breaking up and severing of old associations. The staff were all en
route to their respective homes except the adjutant-general, Major Charles Pickett. He and
Mrs. Dr. Burwell, the only brother and sister
of my Soldier, were to remain with their families for a time in the old Pickett home.
We said our sad good-bye in the great fruit
and flower garden at the rear of the house, and
passing all alone through the large parlors and
wide halls, crept quietly out and softly closed
the door behind us. The only evidence of life
in the dear old house as we looked back was
Dr. Burwell's big dog which, having escaped
from the backyard, howled mournfully within
the gates. The blinds and window-shades had
not been opened or raised since the Federal
forces had occupied the city.
As we boarded the steamer that morning I
realized for the first time that our cause was
lost. In all the days of our beautiful married
life cheer after cheer had always greeted us
wherever we had gone—salute from soldier or
sailor, whether on or off duty. This morning
these honors were replaced by stares of surprise, of mingled curiosity and hate. Dr. Suck-
ley recognized this feeling at onee, and, with a
quizzical smile at my caged-tigress expression
of rage, put his arm in that of my Soldier, and
with a haughty glance at the men, walked boldly
on board. I was shown into the surgeogeneral's stateroom, in which there were many evidences of thoughtful care for my comfort. We
were soon under way.
My Soldier and Dr. Suckley called each other
by their given names and laughed and talked
as cordially as if they had loved the same dear
cause and fought for it side by side. At the
table they drank to each other's health and to
the friends and memories of olden times. A
stranger could not have told which of the two
soldiers had furled his banner.
They chatted of Texas, and the great annexation strife which had changed the political
complexion of the nation away back in whatseemed to my youthful view a remote antiquity.
They talked of Mexico, and my General recalled
reminiscences of the battles in which be had
fought in that wonderful tropical country.
They discussed the wild, free, fresh, novel life
of the far-off Pacifie Coast, the wealth of the
gold-mines of California, its luscious and abundant fruits, and the friends they had known
there. They told stories of the great Northwest,
that was like a mythologic region to me, of the
Chinook Indians, and of the San Juan Island
and the English officers who had oceupied the
island conjointly with my Soldier. I found myself wondering if it had been a dream, and there
had been no internecine strife.
Just before reaching City Point, which is a
few hours' distance from Richmond, Dr. Suckley
came up and told me that we were to stop for
General Ingalls, Grant's QuartermasterGeneral, who wished to come on board to pay his
respects, beseeching me, in his sweet gracious
way, to be more cordial with him than I had
been with another of my Soldier's old friends.
He turned for sympathy to my husband, who
looked imploringly at him and at me. Presently my Soldier drew me to one side and whispered:
"Suekley voiced my wishes, my little wife, and
T want you to meet my old friend just as cor-dially as you can. Put your little hand in his
and forget everything except that he is one of
your hushand's oldest and dearest friends."
I promised with all my heart what he asked,
and really intended to keep my word. I loved
to do everything he bade me. I liked him to
make things hard for me sometimes, that I
might show him how sincere and loving my
obedience was. But when General Ingalls came
on board, was given a salute and received, as
became his rank, with the honors the absence
of which I had marked when my own General
came, I slipped my hand out of my Soldier'sand ran back to my stateroom as fast as I could.
There I burst out erying and shook our baby,
waking him, and told him how his dear father
had been treated—that he had not had any honors paid him at all, and that a dreadful old bad
Yankee General had come on board and taken
them all, and that when he grew up and was
a big man he must fight and fight and fight, and
never surrender, and never forgive the Yankees;
no, not even if his poor, dethroned father asked
him to do go. J told him how his father had
asked me to shake hands with this Yankee
General, because he was his friend, and that J
was going to do it because his father wanted
me to; that I tried and could not and that he
never must, either—-never, never!I did not know there was a witness to all my
bitterness till I heard a smothered chuckle and,
looking up, saw my Soldier and his friend, General Rufus Ingalls, standing over me. With a
twinkle in his eye, and in a voice full of suppressed laughter, General Ingalls said, as he
patted me on the head:
"T don't blame you one bit, little woman—not
a damn bit. I should feel just as terrible about
it as you do if I were in your place. It's all
different with Pickett and me, you see. We
don't mind. Why, do you know, child, we have
slept under the same blanket, fought under the
same flag, eaten out of the same mess-pan,
dodged the same bullets, sealped the same Indians, made love to the same girls—aye, Pickett,
it won't do, by Jove, to tell her all we have done
together—no, no—come, shake hands. I am
dreadful sorry we have had this terrible kick-up
in the family, and all this row and bloodshed,
but we are all Americans, damn it, anyhow, and
your fellows have been mighty plucky to holdout as they have. Come, that's a good child;
shake hands. May I kiss her, Pickett? No—
damn it, I shan't ask you. There, there! Here
is a basket of trash I had the orderly rake together. I don't know what it all is, but I told
the man to do the best he could. Here, Mr.
George junior—with your bright eyes and yourwon't-ery mouth-——here is a green chip for a pair
of red shoes."
General Ingalls put into our baby's hands his
first greenback, and it was the only money we
had, too—every cent. Baby and I said goodbye, and he and my Soldier went out on deck.
While I was peeping into the basket "Mr.
George junior" tore the note in two. I caught
the pieces and stuek my bonnet-pin through
them till T could paste them together. One of
the officers brought me some glue, and I cut a
hundred-dollar Confederate note in two to mend
it with. Poor Confederate money!
*Representing nothing in God's earth now,
And naught in the waters below it;
As the pledge of a nation that passed away,
Keep it, dear friend, and show it.
Show it to those who will lend an ear
To a tale this trifle will tell—
Of Liberty born of a patriot's dream,
Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.
Too poor to possess the precious ores,
And too much of a stranger to borrow,
We issued to-day our promise to pay,
And hoped to redeem on the morrow.
* These verses were written on the back of a Confederate note,
and for a time were aseribed to John Esten Cooke and to
Colonel Wythe Mumford; afterward attributed to Colonel
Jonas,The days rolled on, and weeks became years,
But our coffers were empty still;
Coin was so searee that the treasury quaked
When a dollar wovld drop in the till.
But the faith that was in us was strong, indeed,
Though our poverty well we discerned;
And this little check represents the pay
That our suffering veterans earned.
They knew it had hardly a value in gold,
Yet as gold our soldiers received it;
It gazed in our eyes with a promise to pay,
And every true soldier believed it.
But our boys thought little of price or pay,
Or of bills that were overdue—
We knew if it brought us our bread to-day
'Twas the best our poor country could do.
Keep it! It tells all our history over,
From the birth of our dream till its last;
Modest, and born of the angel Hope,
Like our visions of glory, it passed.
Baby's first greenback was put to dry, and
then I turned my attention to the big covered
basket the sailor had brought in. What an
Aladdin treat it was! Raisins—the first I had
seen in years and years—coffee, real "sho''nuft"
coffee—sugar, crushed sugar—how nice! (we
had had nothing but sorghum-juice sugar and
sweet-potato coffee for so Jong)—rice and
prunes, Jamaica rum, eandy and a box of driedfigs—nothing ever had tasted so delicious as all
these good things—and, well—the Yankee General who gave them all to me—the tones of his
voice made more peace than his words. Eating
the figs, I repeated the words to baby, saying:
"Never mind, baby, about hating this Yankee.
He said your father and he had trailed after the
same Indians and smoked their venison at the
same eamp-fire and had drunk from the same
flask. He said you looked like your father, and
he said you were a beautiful boy. So you need
not mind about hating just this one. He said
geography and politics had forced your father
and nm to opposite courses and it took four
years to settle for their hot-headedness and ambitions. You must never be a politician, and—
you may love this one Yankee a tiny bit, and
may suck a piece of his beautiful candy."Y Soldier did not like to fight his battles
over. He said that the memories they
revived were too sacred and sorrowful
for utterance. The faces of the dead and dying
soldiers on the field of battle were never forgotten. The sorrow of widows and orphans
shadowed all the glory for him. In the pres-
enee of memory he was silent. The deepest
sorrow, like the greatest joy, is dumb.
"We are both too worn and weary now for
aught else but to rest and comfort each other,"
he said. "We will lock out of our lives everything but its joys. From adversity, defeat and
mourning shall spring calmness for the past,
strength for the present, courage for the future.
Now that, in obedience to the command of General Lee, ] have finished and sent off the report
of the last fight of the old division, the closing
days of our dear lost eause, we will put up
the pen for awhile and lay aside our war
thoughts. We will rest and plan for peace and
alter a time we will take up the pen again and
write down our memories for our children and
perhaps for the children of the old division.
We will build us a nest over the ashes of our
grand old home on the James and plant a new
grove in the place of the sturdy old oaks cut
down."
My Soldier possessed the greatest capacity
for happiness and such dauntless courage and
self-control that, to all appearance, he could as
cheerfully and buoyantly steer his way over the
angry, menacing, tumultuous surges of life as
over the waves that glide in tranquil smoothness

my father and mother were taken into our confidence. Lucey was bridled, saddled and brought
to the door. I walked with my Soldier, he
holding the bridle, to the upper gate. It was
ten o'clock; the moon was shining brightly and
all was quiet and still.
My Soldier's plan for me was that I should go
next day to Norfolk, take the steamer to Baltimore and visit his aunt, whose husband, Colonel
Symington, had been in the old army, and who
had not left it to join the Southern Confederacy,
though his sons had fought on that side, one of
them having been detailed on duty at my Soldier's headquarters.
"My aunt will welcome you," he said, "and
you will remain with her until a telegram shall
come to you saying, 'Edwards is better."
(Edwards was my Soldier's middle name.)
That telegram would mean that he was safe
and that I was to join him, starting on the next
train. I was to telegraph to "Edwards" from
Albany, on my way to him, sending my message
to the place at which his telegram had been
dated. If his telegram should say, "There is
still danger of contagion," I was not to start,
but remain with his aunt until another message
should come.
"Cheer up, the shadows will scatter soon.Already bright visions and happy day-dreams
flit through my brain and thrill my heart; so
keep up a 'skookum tum-tum,' little one, and
take care of yourself. Watch for the telegram,
'Hdwards is better,' for it will surely come."
I smiled up at him as he repeated the familiar
old saying, learned from an old Chinook warrior on the Pacific. In the darkest days he
would lift my face upward, look down with his
kind eyes and gentle smile and say, "Keep up
a skookum tum-tum, dear one." All through
my life have the sweet old words come back
to me when the sun has been hidden by the darkest clouds.
I heard the footsteps of the horse keeping
time to my Soldier's whistle, "Believe me if all
those endearing young charms,' away in the
distance long after he was out of sight. I remembered a trick of my childhood which had
been taught me by a half-Indian, half-negress
and, putting my ear to the ground, I listened to
the steps until the last echo was lost. Later I
learned that the faithful Luey bore her master
safely to the station and when the train carried
him away lay down and died, as if she felt that,
having done all she could, life held for her no
more duties or pleasures.
The night-wind sighed with me as I walked
back, repeating, "Keep up a skookum tum-tum."My pathway lay parallel with the Chuckatuck
Creek, a stone's throw to the left. The tide
was high and still coming in. The surging of
the waves seemed to call out to me, "Skookum
tum-tum! Skookum tum-tum!" I could not be
all desolate when the most beautiful forces of
nature, echoing his words, called to me, "Keep
up a brave heart—brave heart!"
My precious old father had waited to have
us say good-bye alone and was now coming forward to meet me. Our baby awakened just as
we reached home and I confided to him the
secret of the telegram and told him his dear
father said that it would surely come and he
always said what was true.
The stars were burning brightly in the midnight sky to light the traveler on his way as he
went afar off. Could there be light on the pathway that led him from me? Had his face been
turned southward, with his eyes fixed joyfully
upon the loved home where he would be wel-
ecomed when the journey was over, what radiant
glory would have flooded the way.
Far up in the zenith I could see "our star'
gleaming brilliantly, seeming to reach out fingers of light to touch me in loving caress. It
was a pure white star that sent down a veil of
silvery radiance. Near it was a red star, gleaming and beautiful, but I did not love it. Itseemed to glow with the baleful fires of war.
My great, loving, tender, white star was like a
symbol of peace looking down with serenest
benediction.
"Our star," he had said as we stood together
only one little evening before—how long it
seemed !—and gazed upward to find what comfort we might in its soft glow. "Wherever we
may be we will look aloft into the night sky
where it shines with steady light, and feel that
our thoughts and hearts are together."
I fell asleep, saying softly, "God's lights to
guide him."LONE, except for baby George, for the
first time in all my seventeen years!
Perhaps no timid little waif thrown out
upon the deep sea of life ever felt more utterly
desolate.

nals ardness and my real sorrows, sympathy

poor David Copperfield, whom Steerforth's
servant had caused to feel so "young and green."
So little did I know of traveling and the
modes and manners of travelers, that I sent
for the captain of the steamer to buy my ticket
and arrange for my stateroom and supper.
I had been warned on Jeaving my home that
the slightest imprudence or careless word from

me nee cause my arrest, and that if it were
an possible that
shar consideration it Had been decided that I
should travel under my maiden name. My train
of thought was interrupted by the ringing of
a bell and a loud voice shouting:
"Passengers will please walk into the customhouse office and show their passports!"
The laws were so strict that no one could
leave any city in the South without a passport
from the military authorities. My grandmother
had given me her 'oath of allegiance," which
everybody in those dread days immediately
after the surrender of the army was compelled
to take in order to purchase medicine, food or
clothing of any kind, or for the transaction of
any business whatever. It was a rare oceur-
rence that a man was found who would take
this iron-clad oath for, no matter how great the
exigency might be, he was branded as a traitor
if he yielded. So the women, who were most
bitter, too, in their feelings, were obliged to
make a sacrifice of their convictions and principles, and take this oath in order to alleviate
the suffering of their loved ones. I!Iness in the
family and the urgent necessity for quinine and
salt left my unselfish little grandmother no alternative, and she found a kind of safety in theoath. It had brought her relief and she wanted
that I should have it with me as a "mascot" or
safeguard.
With carpet-bag, basket and baby I started
into the custom-house office and explained to the
officer in charge:
"J am very sorry, sir, that I have no passport.
The steamer was about to sail as I reached Norfolk. I came from a little village thirty miles
beyond where passports are not given. I have
an oath of allegiance, if that will answer in its
place."
The officer, laughing, said:
"No; never mind. It is all right; only register your name. I remember you did come onboard just as the whistle blew; but was there
not another passenger who came on with you~
a gentleman?"
"Yes, sir,' I replied. "It was my precious
father, and he went back home in the little sailboat."
There must have been something to excite
suspicion in the way I wrote my name or in my
manner. I boldly wrote out my given name and
then, as I began to write my last name, I looked
all around me, confused, and changed the letter
"P" to "C," writing "Corbell." Then I began to
erase "Corbell" and write "Phillips," the name
in my oath of allegiance. While there wasnothing very false in what I did, I felt guilty
and was frightened, for I had been brought up
to be strictly truthful.
I had not been long in the saloon when baby
became restless and fretful. 1 was impatiently
awaiting the coming of the captain, for whom
I had sent, when a man appeared. He had
short curly hair, deep, heavy eyebrows, eyes
sunken and close together as if they had to be
foeused by his big, hooked nose to enable them
to see. He was chewing alternately one end of
his crinkly moustache and one side of his thick
red lip and was making a sucking noise with
his tongue as he said:
"Madam, you sent for the captain of the boat,
I believe."
"Yes, sir."
"What do you wish?"
"T want you to be kind enough to get my
ticket and stateroom, please," I replied. 'My
father had only time to put me on board and
could not make any arrangements."
"Certainly; with pleasure. You stop in Baltimore long?"
"J don't know," I replied.
"You have been there before, I suppose?"
"Oh, no; never. Ihave been nowhere outside
of Virginia and North Carolina. Most of my
traveling hefore my marriage was in going toand from Lynehburg, where I was at school.
"Onee I rode on horseback to the Peaks of
Otter, which are among the highest mountains
of the South. You can't imagine how glorious
it was to be up there so far away from the earth.
When I first looked down from their lofty
heights the sky and the earth seemed to be
touching, and presently the rain began to pour.
I could see the glimmering, glittering drops,
but could not hear them fall. 1 was above the
clouds and the rain, up in the sunshine and
stillness, the only audible sound being a strange
flapping of wings as the hawks and buzzards
flew by. Suddenly the rain ceased, the haze
vanished and I saw below the rugged mountains
the level country that looked like a vast ocean
in the distance.
"The words of John Randolph echoed in my
heart with this infinite mystery of nature. He
with only a servant spent the night on those
mighty rocks and in the morning as he was
watehing the glory of the sunrise he pointed
upward with his long slender hand and, having
no one else to whom to express his thought,
charged his servant never from that time to
believe anyone who said there was no God.
" «No, sah, Marse John; no sah,' said the
awe-stricken servant. 'I ain't gwine to, sah. I
ain't gwine to let none of Marse Thomas Didy-
muses' temptatious bedoutin' tricks cotch no
holt of my understandin' of de Lord.'
"Once, too, T "
"You have relatives in Baltimore?" said the
gentleman, abruptly interrupting me; otherwise,
feeling that geography and history were safe
subjects, I should have rattled on till I had
told him all J knew.
"Yes, sir,' I replied. "I am going to visit
them."
"Where were you from this morning?"
"T came from a litle country village about
thirty miles from Norfolk—Chuckatuck, in
Nansemond County."
As I was about to launch another tide of historic information upon him he again interrupted
me.
"T saw your father as he was leaving the
steamer. J was attracted to him because he
made an appeal to all Masons, asking of them
protection and eare for his child and grandehild.
He was thus making himself known to any of
us, his brothers, who might be aboard when he
disappeared at the turn of the boat. So you
van safely confide in me, and T will help you in
any way possible."
"Thank you,' I replied. "T know my dear,
dear papa is a Mason, and that he was anxious
about me, but there is nothing to confide—noth-ing. J want only a stateroom and my tickets
and some milk for the baby. I do not wish for
any supper myself; I am too lonesome to eat.
It is wicked to feel blue and downhearted, with
baby and all the kind friends to watch over meas you say; and then God is always near."
"Yes, that is true; but did you lose your husband in the war?"
"No, Sir?
"fe was in the war, though, was he not?"
Ves sine'
\ fear came into my heart that I was talking
too much. I did not want him to know anything
concerning my busband, whose rank it was especially important to keep secret. I encouraged myself with the reflection that the end
justified the means, even though a slight deviation from the truth might be involved, and
said:
"You could not have heard of him, and he was
not of sufficient rank to have made an impression upon you if you had."
"Where is he now?"
"In the country."
"And you are leaving him?'
"Ves, sir, but just for a little while."
Then he talked of how much the Southerners
had lost and how much they had to forgive;
how easy it was to bear victory and how hardto endure defeat, saying that if he had been
born in the South he would have been a rebel,
and that his sympathies even now were with
the Southern people. A sudden suspicion came
to me and I said:
"J wish there had never been any rebels at
all; not even the first rebel, George Washington ;
and now, sir, please, I do not want to talk about
the war. I am very weary and sleepy and
would like to retire. If you please, sir, will you
get me my stateroom and ticket? I am so tired
——sgo very tired."
Baby was lying asleep on my lap, hypnotized
by the chandeliers. The man looked down on
him for a moment and then said, "Of course, I
will get them for you," and was going, when an
ex-Confederate officer, one of my Soldier's old
comrades and friends, came up and, cordially
extending his hand, greeted me:

I thank you."
"Tam so glad to have met you," he returned.
"Will see you later on," and was hobbling away
on his erutehes: He saw by my manner that
he had said something to embarrass me and
left with a pained look. He was still dressed
in his old Confederate gray, from which the
brass buttons had all been cut, in obedience to
the order from the custom-house office, and replaced by plain steel. For several moments not
a word was spoken. Then I looked up and said:
"My tickets and stateroom, please."
"TI thought you said your name was Corbell,"
he of the hooked nose rejoined as he held my
money shaking in his hand. "I thought you
said your husband's rank was not sufficient to
have made an impression; that in all probability I had never heard of him."
Oh, that smacking sound of jaw and tongue,
and that beak of a nose, and those little black
eyes which grew into Siamese twins as they
glared at me like the eyes of a snake!
"Did I say that?" I asked and, with a face
all honesty and truth, I looked straight into
those eyes and told, without blushing, without
a tremor in my voice, the first deliberate falsehood IT had ever told:
"Did I say so? Well, my friends think thatmy mind has been unbalanced by the way the
war has ended and they are sending me from
home to new scenes and associations to divert
me, with the hope of making me well and strong
again. Corbell was my maiden name, but I do
not know how I happened to say that my husband's rank was Jow, for I was so proud of it;
T could not have been thinking. Will you please
be so good as to get my ticket? I am so tired
I don't know what I am saying."
He went away, and the stateroom keys were
brought to me by a waitress who unlocked the
door for me, and I went in, too frightened now
to think of supper, too frightened to sleep, and
wondering if, in my imprudence, I had hurt my
husband and what would happen if I had.
All night long the noise of the wheel was tome the sound of the executioner's axe. All
night long it rose and fell through seas of blood
~—the heart's blood of valiant men, of devoted
women, of innocent little children. Near morning I fell asleep and dreamed that it was 1 who
had destroyed all the world of people whose lifeblood surged around me with a maddening roar,
and that I was destined to an eternity of remorse.
When I awoke the boat had landed. Dressing
hurriedly I went to the door and found that
it was locked on the outside. As the chamber-maid did not answer my repeated call, I beckoned to a sailor passing my window and asked
him to tell her that I was locked in and wished
that she would come and let me out. When she
came she told me that she was not permitted to
open the door. J asked if we were not at Baltimore and an officer who was with the maid answered that we were, but that I was to be detained until the authorities should come and
either release or imprison me, as I was supposed to be a suspicious character.
On a slip of paper I wrote—'A Master
Mason's wife and daughter in distress demands
in their name that you will come to her," and
gave it to the chambermaid, asking her to take
it to the captain. As she hesitated the officer
said, "You might as well."
She went and while I was trying to hush the
baby a voice as kind and gentle as the benevolent face into which I looked, said:
"What can I do for you, madam? You sent
for me."
"No, sir,' I replied, "I sent for the captain
of the boat, but I am glad you came; you seem
so kind and may help me in my trouble."
"T am the captain of the boat," he answered.
"What can I do for you?"
"You are not the gentleman who represented
himself as the captain of the boat last night,sir, and bought for me my ticket. He was short
and dark me
The gentleman interrupted me, saying that the
pseudo captain was a Federal detective who had
advised that I be detained on the steamer until
his return with the authorities and warrant.
1 told him what the man had said about my
father and the Masonie¢ sign.
The eaptain rephed:
"Your father did make that sign and placed
you in our eare. Come, I am captain of this
steamer, and a captain is king in his own boat.
Where did you say you wish to go? Stand
aside," he said to the officer in charge.
Giving me his arm, he placed me and baby,
earpet-bag and basket, in a carriage and the
driver was told to go to 97 Brenton Street.
"Yis, sor," said the Irishman. "97 Brinton
Strate, sure."
"God bless you and watch over you! Goodbye, little baby." :
After driving some time, the Irishman impatiently told me there was no street by that
name and I would have to get out, but not until
I had paid him for the time he had been hunting
for 97 Brenton Street.
I did not know enough to go to a drug store
and consult a directory. I was at my wits' end,
if I had ever had any wits."Drive me back to the captain of the boat,
please," I said. "I don't know what else to do."
When I went on board the captain was not
yet gone, which was an unusual thing. He had
waited to see the officers before leaving. I answered the smile that came into his face, in
spite of his kind heart, by handing him the letter of my aunt who wrote a hand that was not
only peculiar but illegible.
"Read, captain, and see if this is not Brenton
Street, the place to which my aunt has written
me I must come."
"Go to 97 Brenton Street, where my niece,
Mrs. C , will bring you to my house,'" he
read. "It might be anything else as well as
Brenton," he said. "It looks like Brenton, but
I have lived here all my life and have never
heard of such a street. I will get my directory
and look. No; but it may be Preston; let's look;
but there are no C s living there. You might
try this house, at any rate, 97 Preston Street,
and if you do not find your friends, come to the
number on this eard, where my wife and I will
be happy to have you as our guest, you and
the little lost bird, till you can write to your
friends and find out where they want you to
come."
Off again I started and arrived at 97 Preston
Street. I wrote on my card and sent it in:a niece of Mrs.
"Does Mrs. C-——— live here

In a moment there were two or three faces
at the windows, and in another moment as many
voices at the carriage door asking, "Is this
George Pickett's wife and child?" and I was
thankful to be once more where they knew
George Pickett's wife and ehild.
Besides the lovely people whose home it was,
there was with them, on her way to visit her
mother, Mrs. General Boggs, one of the most
charming women I ever met. She had just returned from the South. Her husband was in

body went to parties and receptions and dinners,
and received people and drove and paid ealls,
while my soul waited with intense longing for
the telegram, "Edwards is better."
One day I had been out to dine and, coming

When he slept I leaned back and closed my eyes
and saw a world of beauty and bloom as the
glad words went dancing through my heart.
Was there ever so sweet a slumber-song since
babies were invented to awaken the deepest
melody of mother-hearts? I went to sleep with
my little one in my arms. I had not money
enough to get a berth—just barely enough to
buy my ticket and pay my expenses through to
Montreal, Canada, at-which point the telegram
was dated. t a
When I awakened later I found that a han
spun shawl had been placed under my head. I
never thought about who had been so kind, nor
why the shawl was there. <All my life long

My poor * little ae was
censured myself for having al-
on ed Lips to catch cold on the train while I was
sleeping. He was teething, and was very fretful. He had been used to his nurse, his black
mammy, and missed her customary care and
attention and was tired of me, preferring any-
hody else. Some philanthropic ladies on board
the steamer seemed very much concerned, and
at a loss to understand why he was so unhappy
with me, not knowing that he was accustomed to
a circle of admiring friends to whom he might
appeal in turn.
"Nurse, why do you not take the child to its
mother?" one would say, and a look of incredulity would follow my assertion that I was its
mother. "Then, why don't you quiet the child,
if you are, and find out what is the matter with
it?" and so on,
IT was indignant and my manner must have
made them think there was something wrong with
me and the child, for they followed me about,
asking intrusive questions and making offensive
remarks. I was walking the deck, trying to quiet
him, all tired and worn out as I was, when a gentleman came up to me. On his shoulder I recognized the shawl that had been put under my
head on the ears the night before. He said:"Madam, excuse me, but I do not think you
have had any dinner, and you must be worn outwith hunger and fatigue from fasting and carrying the baby. Won't you let me hold him while
you go down and eat something?"
Even though he carried the shawl which bespoke my faith, I was afraid to trust him with
so precious a treasure, and would rather have
starved than have permitted my baby to go out
of my sight.
"Thank you, very much, but I could not think
of troubling you," I said. '"No-——oh, no."
Then he asked:
"May I order something for you here?"
I was hungry, and was glad for the open way
he had found for me, and said, "Yes," handing
him twenty-five cents. It was all I could afford
to pay for dinner, but as I looked at the tray
when it was brought to me, I thought, "How
cheap things must be in New York," for there
were soup and fish—a kind of yellow fish I had
uever seen before, salmon, I afterward learned
it was—-stewed with green peas, a bird, asparagus, potatoes, ice-cream, a cup of coffee and a
glass of sherry.
Upon his insisting that it would be restful to
the baby, I let him hold little George while I
ate my dinner. I had not known how hungry
I was, nor how much J was in need of nourish-ment. Baby immediately became quiet in his
arms. Whether it was due to the change or not,
1 do not know, but in a little while he was fast
asleep. I covered him up with the shawl to
which the gentleman pointed, finished eating
my delicious dinner, taking my time and enjoying it, while he read his book and held my
baby. When the servant came and took away
the tray, I arose and, thanking the stranger for
his kindness, said:
"T will take the baby now, if you please."
"If you would rather," he said, "yes, but I
think he will be more comfortable with me for
awhile. Then, too, you might waken him if
you moved him. Let me hold him while you
rest. Here is a sweet little book, if you would
like to read it. I think, however, it would be
better for you to rest; to sleep, if you could.
You look really fagged out."
The book he gave me was a child's book-—it
may have been "Fern Leaves." J can't remember the name, but pasted in the book was a Jetter
written in a child's irregular hand:
For my dear darly popsy who is gon to fite the
war fum his little darly dorter little mary
Dear popsy don kill the por yangees and don
let the yangees kill you my poor popsy little
mary
Dear popsy com back soon to me an mama angrandad thats all. I says your prayers popsy
evry day fum little mary
Beneath-little Mary's name was this line:
"Little Mary died on the 16th of May, 1864—
her fifth birthday."
I rested, but thought of little Mary as I
watched my own baby who was sleeping so
sweetly in this childless stranger's arms-—till
presently the waves brought back to me the
days of my childhood—the story of the sailor
with his stolen mill, grinding out salt, forever
and forever, and the lost talisman lost still—
back to my grandmother's knee, listening with
wonder-eyes to "\ is salt," the while
and tl 1e sha dows rose to make place for one
darker still.
EEN the train from Albany my attention
was attracted by a man in close conversation with the conductor. I wag evidently the subject of discussion, for they would
look carefully over the paper they held and then
at me as if comparing me with something therein described. Had I been a hardened criminal
they would probably not have taken the risk
of thus warning me of the fact that I wag under
suspicion. As my appearance would seem to
indicate that, if a law-breaker, I was a mere tyro
in crime, they supposed they could safely take
notes of me. I was absolutely sure that they
were talking of me and trembled with a presentiment of coming evil. I tried to turn my
face to the window but my eyes were fascinated,
A thousand preposterous fears passed in review
before my mind, though the real one never suggested itself. I endeavored to dispel them each
in turn, arguing that the scrutiny of the men
foreboded nothing, because I seemed an object
of enriosity to everybody and, recalling my appearance, I do not wonder.
My dress was different from that of those
around me, though I was unconscious of any
defect in my apparel, being garmented in my
very best, the traveling gown in which I had
been married, and which had been bought and
made under great difficulties and kept afterward
with scrupulous care. So I was perfectly well
satisfied with myself.
IT wore a long, loose-fitting black silk mantilla
with three ruffles at the bottom, while those
around me were dressed in tight-fitting, short
cloth jackets. My gray straw bonnet, sewed
into poke shape by our fashionable village milliner, extended far over the face, its wreath of
pink moss-rosebuds inside tangled in with my
dark brown hair. It was trimmed on the outside
with several clusters and bunches of hand-made
grapes of a lighter shade of gray. My collar
was about five inches wide and pinned in front
with a cameo breastpin. The prevailing collar
worn by the world around me was linen, very
narrow, only an edge showing, and small jaunty
hats, worn back on the head, were the style.
The conductor seemed to be arguing with the
Strange man as I caught his eye. Just then my
baby sprang forward and snatched a newspaperthat an old gentleman in front of me was reading, and sbrieked when it was loosened from his
grasp, the old gentleman looking daggers in
answer to my apology. After this diversion I
found that the two men were gone, for which
I thanked Heaven.
I had just settled back, a little unnerved and
weak, when from behind me came a touch on my
shoulder and, turning around, I saw the strange
man and the conductor. The former said, "I
have a warrant for vour arrest, Madam," and
forthwith served it upon me.
There on the ears, all alone, miles away from
home and friends, two dollars and ten cents all
my little store, I was arrested for—stealing!
Stealing my own child! J could not read the
warrant as it trembled in my hands—I had
never before seen or heard of one. Baby
thought it was a compromise for the old gentleman's paper, and it was with difficulty rescued
from his little clenched hands, after being torn
in the struggle.
As soon as my confused wits grasped the
nieaning of this I said:
"This baby? This baby, sir? Jt is mine—
mine—it is named after its father—it is mine
and I can prove it by everybody in the world,
and~—-—"
"Well, well," said the conductor kindly, hisvoice trembling, "that's all he wants, lady. You
will be detained, probably, only till the next
train."
"But I must go on," I said, "for my husband
is looking for me and I could not bear to stay
away another minute longer than the time at
which he expects me. Please, everybody, help
me."
My fright had attracted attention, and some
stared, some were too refined even to look toward me; others merely glaneed over their
glasses or looked up from their books and went
on reading. Some kept their faces carefully
turned toward the landscape; a few, just as
heartless and more vulgar, gathered around me
in open-mouthed curiosity.
One woman's good heart, thank God, redeemed
them all. She came forward, her tender blue
eyes moist with sympathy, her black erépe veil
thrown back from her lovely face and her waving hair with the silver threads all too soon
among the gold, and said in a voice so sweet
that it might have come from the hearts of the
lilies-of-the-valley that she wore bunched at her
swan-white throat:
"Come, I will stop off with you if it must be.
Let me see the paper."
Simultaneously with her, the gentleman of the
home-spun shaw] came from I don't know whereand asked, too, to see the paper and both got
off the train with me.
I was so weak that I could not hold my baby,
for all at once there came over me the sense of
my utter helplessness to prove that my child
was my own, There was no one to whom I]
could telegraph without revealing my identity
and the purpose of my journey. A telegram
to my friends at home would alarm them and
might betray me. A message to my Soldier
would jeopardize his safety, for he would surely
come to me at once.
"Look, look!' I said to the magistrate and
officers when they read aloud the suspicions and
accusation of the philanthropic ladies who were
with me on board the Albany steamer and who,
in their zeal to secure a right and correct a
wrong, ignorant of the cause of my child's
discomfort and unhappiness with me and the
reasons for my rather suspicious reticence, had
caused my arrest.
Thus do the pure and holy ever keep guard
over the sins of the world and throw the cable-
cord of justice around the unregenerate to drag
them perforce into the path of rectitude. May
they reap the reward to which their virtues
entitle them.
"Took at his eyes and look at mine," I exclaimed, holding his little face up against myown. "Can't you all see that it is my child?"
"That may be, but give us the name of someone to whom we may telegraph—some tangible
proof. If he is your own there must be someone who knows you and can testify in your behalf."
"No, no," I said, "there is no one. I have
nobody to help me, and if God does not show
you all some way and your own hearts do not
convinee you I don't know what I shall do."
My poor little, half-starved, in-litigation baby
refused to be comforted. The kind gentleman
with the shawl could amuse him no longer. He
had dashed from him the keys and pushed the
watch from his ear and demanded impatiently
the right of sustenanee. The dear, good woman
beside me, with the smile of the redeemed and
a look of relief lighting up her face, touched
mine, whispering in my ear while I held the
baby's hands to prevent him in his impatience
from tearing apart my mantle and untying my
bonnet-strings :
"Do you nurse your baby?"
"Yes," I replied, "and he is so hungry, poor
little thing."
She stood up, leaning on her cane, for she
ras slightly lame, and said in a voice clear and
sweet:
"Gentlemen, I have a witness"—-my heart al-most stood still—'here, in the child who cannot
speak, It is not always a proof of motherhood,
but with the circumstantial evidence and the
youth of this mother, this beyond peradventure
is proof convineing. The child is still nourished trom her own body," and she opened my
mantle.
T, who had never nursed my baby in the presence of even my most intimate friends, bared
my bosom before all those strange men and
women and nursed him as proof that I was his
mother, while tears of gratitude to the sweet
friend and to God flowed down my cheeks and
dropped onto baby's face as he wonderingly
looked up, trying to gather up the tears with
lus little dimpled fingers and thankfully enjoying the proof. The men turned aside and tears
flowed down more than one rugged face. The
kind stranger with the shawl lifted his eyes
heavenward as if in thanksgiving, and then
turned them earthward and breathed a bitter
eurse, deep and heartfelt. Perhaps the recording angel jotted down the curse on the credit
side of the ledger with as great alacrity as he
registered there the prayer of thanks.
T trust that the philanthropic ladies, when
the facts were placed before them, were as
surely convinced as all these people were that
T had not stolen my child. I hope they werepleased by this indication that some degree of
innocence existed in the world, outside of their
own virtuous hearts, but—I don't know.
"Take thy fledgling, poor mother dove, under
thy trembling wings, back to its nest and the
father bird's care. J shall go a few miles further where I stop to see my baby," said my new
friend. "This little boy who brought me back
to life is older than yours. He is the child of
my only son, whose young life ebbed out on the
battlefield of Gettysburg, and whose sweet spirit
has joined that of his noble father, my husband,
which in his first battle was freed. This baby
blesses our lives—the young mother's and the
old mother's."
The ears were crowded with soldiers returning home, disbanded soldiers, soldiers on furlough, and released prisoners, with pale, eadav-
erous, unshaven faces and long, unkempt hair.
One from Andersonville, more ragged and
emaciated than the others, was selling his pictures and describing the horrors of his prison
life and, as he told of his sufferings and torture
amid groans of sympathy, maledictions and
curses were hurled against my people. Once
his long, bony arm and hand seemed to be
stretched menacingly toward me as he drew the
picture of "the martyred Lincoln, whose blood
cries out for vengeance. We follow his hearse;let us swear hatred to these people against
whom he warred and, as the cannon beats the
hours with solemn progression, renew with each
note unappeasable hatred."
I crouched back in my seat, almost holding
my breath as I pressed my baby to my wildly
throbbing heart. The train stopped and the
sweet new friend touched my brow with her lips,
Jeaving the kiss and a prayer, put the lilies into
my hand and was gone. The ears moved on
and there was a great void in my heart as I
thought of my God-given friend, so lately found,
so swiftly lost.
All this was half a century ago, but one of
the hhes yet hes in my prayer-book, glorifying
with the halo of a precious memory the page
on which it rests.
A man, not a soldier I think, for brave soldiers are magnanimous and generous always,
stood up in a seat opposite mine and said:
"When I think of the horrors of Libby and
Andersonville and look at these poor sufferers
T not only want to invoke the vengeance of a
just God but I want to take a hand in it myself.
Quarter should be shown to none; every man,
woman and child of this accursed Southern race
should be bound to their own slaves for a specified length of time, that they, too, might know
the curse of serfdom. Their lands should beconfiscated and given to those whom they have
so long and so cruelly wronged."
As he in detail related the story of the seanty
allowance of the prisoners, the filth and darkness of their cells, I longed to stand and plead
for my people, and tell how they, too, were without soap, food or clothes; that we had no medi-
eines, even, except what were smuggled through
the lines, and that our own poor soldiers were
barefooted and starving, and that all the suffering of prisoners on both sides could have been
avoided by carrying out the terms proposed
by the Confederate Government. If I had only
dared to raise the veil and reveal the truth perhaps sympathy might have tempered their bitterness, the flame of divine kinship smouldering
in their veins, hidden as in a tomb, might have
miraged over the gulf of wrongs a bridge of
holier feelings.
Yet the memory of the woman whose son had
been killed on the field of Gettysburg and whose
lily, now browned and withered with the years, I
eherishwith such tender care, softened the words
that were like blows to my ear and heart. Thus
the power of one pure heart radiating its love
upon the world as an odorous flower diffuses
fragrance on the surrounding atmosphere, up-
lhitts the sorrowing spirit and strengthens it to

On reaching the Canada side the passengers
were summoned to the custom-house office to
have their baggage examined, and I, with my
earpet-bag, basket and baby, followed my fellow travelers. When my turn came I handed
the officer my keys and checks, which, after a
glance, he gave back to me, saying with haste
and indifference, as if it might have been the
most trivial of matters:
"Your luggage has been left on the States
side. Your checks were not exchanged."
Taking the wrong train at the wrong point
put me into Montreal later than I was expected,
but I religiously followed instructions to remain
on the train which stopped over at Montreal,
until I should be claimed, like a genera] delivery

side.
"What will you have of me?" I asked.
There were tears in the eyes of the gentleman
whose face had seemed familiar, and the next
minute baby and I were in his great strong
arms, and his tender voice was reproachfully
asking :"Don't you know your husband, little one?"
I was looking for my Soldier as I had been
used to seeing him-—~dressed in the dear old
Confederate uniform, and with his hair long
and curling. The beautiful hair had been
trimmed, and while he was not subject to the
limitations of Samson in the matter of personal
strength, a critical observer might have detected
variations in personal beauty. An English
civilian suit of rough brown cloth had replaced
the old Confederate gray.
The two gentlemen with him were Mr. Corse,
a banker, a brother of one of my Soldier's brigadiers, and Mr. Symington, of Baltimore, a
refugee. 1 noticed that these gentlemen called
my Soldier "Mr. Edwards" and me "Mrs, Edwards," which made me feel somewhat strange
and unnatural. I may have reflected that I was
in a foreign country, and very far north of our
old home, and perhaps even people's names
were affected by political and climatic conditions.
I had expected my Soldier to take us to a
quiet little room in some unpretentious boarding-house, but was too tired to express my surprise when we were driven in a handsome carriage to a palatial home, with beautiful grounds,
fountain and flowers. A big English butler with
side-whiskers opened the large carved doors,and a pretty girl in a eap took baby from my
arms.
After that I remember only being tired
tired—-so very tired. When I had rested enough
to think again, I was on a sofa dressed in a
pretty, soft, silken robe, and J heard a kind
voice saying:
"The lady is better; she will be all right. Let
her sleep."
Glancing up, I saw a benevolent-looking old
gentleman and a pair of spectacles. I closed
my eyes and heard the gentleman with the
familiar face say such beautiful things, and his
voice and touch thrilled my heart so that I kept
my eyes shut and never wanted to open them
again; and presently the pretty girl with the
cap on came in with baby in her arms, dressed
in a beautiful robe.
"Ze petite enfant—very much no hungry now
—he eat trés pap—he sleep—he wash—he dress
~~he eat trés much. He no hungry; he eat some
more trés much again. He smile; he now no
very much hungry again some more."
Was I in the land of fairies, and was the
gentleman with the familiar face the prince of
fairies, as he was the prince of lovers? Our
baby's outstretched arms and cry for me as he
recognized me dispelled any such delusion, but
I was too tired to hold out my hands to him.
I soon felt his little face, however, nestling close
against my own, and felt, too, the touch of yet
another faee, and heard the same voice which
had made my heart thrill with bliss whisper
again more things like unto those other things it
had whispered, but I was too tired and too
happy to speak, and my blessings seemed too
sacred to open my eyes upon, so I kept them
closed. When the old English physician came
in the next day he said:
"Ah, ha! Ah, ha! The lady is most well.
Keep on feeding her and sleeping her. She is
half-starved, poor lady, and half-dazed, too, by
sleeplessness. Ah, ha! Ah, ha! Poor lady!
That will do—feed her and sleep her; feed her
and sleep her. Ah, ha! Ah, ha! that's all"
When the old doctor was gone I remember
listening for the tread of the sentinel outside—
confusing the "ah, ha! ah, ha!" with the tramp,
tramp, tramp—and as I asked, the question
brought back the memory that the war was over,
the guns were stacked, the camp was broken,
and my Soldier of the sweet face was all my
very own. I looked around inquiringly and up
into the familiar face for answer, and he, my
Soldier, a General no longer, explained our
pleasant surroundings. His old friends, Mr.
and Mrs. James Ilutton, he said, had been suddenly summoned to Nngland, and had prayed
him, as a great favor to them, to be their guest
until their return, as otherwise the delay to
make the necessary arrangements for their
going would prevent their eateching the first
steamer. Thus we had a beautiful home in
which to rest, to grow well and strong, to forget
all that could be forgotten of the past, and to
enjoy the present
who had served on my Soldier's staff, wrote
that, through his kinsman, the surgeon in charge
of Fortress Monroe, he had been permitted to
see Mr. Davis.
He arrived at the Fortress on the morning
that the fetters had been removed from the
ankles of the feeble old man by order of the
physician, because they endangered the life of
one so iJ] and weak, and was told by the surgeon
that the only way for him to see Mr. Davis was
to accompany the surgeon on his rounds, when
he could see all the patients, the ex-President
among the rest.
The eaptain followed the surgeon until he
same to the imprisoned chief. The face of Mr.
Davis was turned from the door and the visitorstood for a moment silently observing the great
change in the man whom he had last seen as
the President of the Confederacy. Then he
stepped forward and laid his hand on the arm
of Mr. Davis. —
"Mr. President!' he said reverently.
Mr. Davis looked up quickly.
"fam Robert Bright, of General Pickett's
staff."
The hand of the prisoner closed warmly over
the one lying upon his arm. "He looked into
my face as if a miracle had been performed,"
wrote Captain Bright.
"My own! One of my own again!" said Mr.
Davis, in that musical voice that held a note of
heart-break always after the fall of the Confederacy—a cadence which deepened and saddened his melodious tones until they were
merged into the perfect symphony of the greater
life.
In his loneliness he had so yearned for someone who had belonged to him—some one who
had taken part with him in that short-lived,
tragic dream-nation for which the South had
given her blood and treasure—that his heart
leaped up to meet the sympathy of the tender,
reverent voice.
The surgeon came up to make his morning
examination. At sight of him the light in thesad face died away and the look of helpless
suffering returned. Having finished his work
the surgeon said:
"Come, Captain."
"And is this all?" asked Mr. Davis, as his
visitor passed on and again reverently touched
his arm.
"T would have given my whole fortune," wrote
the captain, who had just succeeded to an inheritance of considerable value, "to have stayed
there in his place and let him go free."
"There is not one of us in all the South, not
a soldier of us, who would not gladly take his
place and save him from humiliation and suffering," said my Soldier, looking up from the letter.
Captain Bright pleaded with his kinsman to
let him make another visit and stay long enough
to speak some word of cheer to his heartbroken
chief.
"I do not think that I can," said the surgeon.
"The risk to us all would be too great."
"T do not see any risk," was the reply. "The
whole place isdouble-guarded. Neither that poor
old feeble man nor I could possibly get away."
As the surgeon really wished to serve his
kinsman, not only in return for past favors but
to be gracious as a host, after refleetion he said:
"To-morrow when I make my rounds I will
try to arrange to leave you there till I return."The next day the captain went into the cell
and the surgeon, closing the door, turned to the
sentinel and said:
"Guard that door well and see that it is not
opened until I come back. That man in there is
my relation, but we must not trust him too far."
Having thus secured for the caller an uninterrupted interview with Mr. Davis, the surgeon
continued on his way.
"Mr. Davis, I have only a few moments before the doctor finishes his round. Can I do
anything for you?—anything? Tell me, quick."
"No; there is nothing, my young friend—nothing; but I thank you for the wish."
The captain took from his pocket a eheque-
book and pencil, saying:
"Write on the backs of these cheques any
messages or letters you may want to send and
I will see that they reach their destination."
Mr. Davis replied:
"T cannot do that. No; you would be risking
your life."
"T have risked my life before and now would
risk my soul for you. But there is no danger,
Mr. President."
Mr. Davis wrote messages on three of the
cheques, one to Senator Wall, of New Jersey,
one to a friend in Pennsylvania, a third to another friend whose name I have forgotten."You can write to Mrs. Davis that you have
seen me. 'Take my love to all my friends. I
leave them in God's care. This means to me
more than all the doctor's medicine--this one
glimpse of one who says, 'Mr. President'—-who
eomes to me and recognizes all that I have tried
to do for my people."
Just as the cheque-book was returned to its
place the surgeon came in, looking at him suspiciously. Seeing nothing, and knowing that
there was no pen, ink or paper in the room, he
went out, followed by the visitor.
Early next day Captain Bright left for
Williamsburg. When he and the surgeon were
on the wharf some soldiers came forward.
"Halt!" commanded the captain.
"What does this mean?" asked the surgeon.
'We are ordered to search this gentleman,"
was the explanation.
"This gentleman is my kinsman and my
guest," said the surgeon.
After consultation with the officers the embarrassment was relieved by the countermanding of the order and Captain Bright departed
with the precious messages in his pocket.
"The feeling of fear," he wrote, "came to me
for the first time in all my life; not for myself
but for that beloved old man who is dear now to
us all."Mr, Davis had not lived through those terrible
four years without making enemies. Who in
such a position could? But when he was made
to suffer for the mistakes of the whole nation,
every Southern heart went out in love to him,
regardless of past antagonisms. All personal
animosities, all political differences were forgotten, and the people were united in a loving
sympathy with the toil-worn, feeble, sorrowful
old man, as they never could have been by any
gifts or favors which he might have heaped
upon them had he won not only the object for
which he had given his life, but the gold and
jewels of a kingdom.
A generation later, when the people of the
South met in Richmond to dedicate a monument
to Jefferson Davis, they did not hold first in
their hearts the memory of the statesman, the
orator, the gracious gentleman, the President
of the Confederacy. Above all the pictures that
came thronging before them,as they recalled the
life history of the man in whose honor they
had met, was that scene in the gloomy cell and
that bowed and feeble old man with the wounds
of the irons upon him, in whose sad eyes the
light of love shone as he reached out to greet
a messenger of his own people and said brokenly: "My own! One of my own!"OUR LEFT-HANDERS
came to our room with a telegram for
Mr. Edwards, announcing that Mr. and
Mrs. Hutton would sail for home the following
week.
We began to hunt for a place to live, beginning with the hotels and larger boarding-houses,
and ending with the smaller ones. After a week
of varied, and some very funny, experiences, we
decided at last upon one house, principally because of its attractive court overlooked by pleasant verandas.
"With its glistening fountain and pretty
shrubbery and flowers, how nice for our baby,"
Isaid. "How cool and refreshing are the sound
of the water and the glimpse of green."
So, for baby's sake, the selection was made
and our rooms engaged. Our Jandlady was a
very dark brunette, and prided herself upon being a French Canadian, but——
248
ieee first week in June the Freneh maid
"That man of mine," she sorrowfully said,
"is a soggy Englishman, and you would hardly
believe it possible he could be the father of
our two beautiful daughters. Both of them are
going to do well, but they don't take after their
pa. The oldest is engaged to be married to a
Stateser with nine businesses!"
By the "nine businesses" and "Stateser" I
gathered from her explanation, which she volunteered in answer to my puzzled look, that the
fortunate son-in-law-to-be was a Yankee living
in a small town in the State of Vermont, and
owning a little country store where woolen and
cotton goods, silks and flannels, pottery, queen's-
ware, hardware, groceries, grain, and so forth,
were sold, the precursor of the department
store. In her admiration of him, after each
alleged "business" she affixed the, to her, high-
sounding title of "merchant."
The second daughter, she told me, was learning to sing.
"She has a sweet voice, but she don't take
after her pa," she said, "and the young preacher
student in the next room to the right of the one
you have chosen is very much taken with her,
and it looks like I'd get both girls off my hands
before long."
She said she could not give me the use of
the parlors when the girls wanted them."The Stateser comes a long ways, you know,
and has to have it all to himself when he is
here."
She generously suggested that if none "of
them" were using the parlor at the time when
my "company came," she would let me entertain
my visitors in it at the rate of a "shilling a
dozen," which arrangement I considered a very
good one for me, as I did not expect to have
more than a shilling's worth of visitors in six
months.
Our meals were to be served in our own room,
except on Sundays, when we would dine in the
public dining-room and do our own "waiting,"
like the others. We did not exactly understand
what that meant, but one day's experience
proved it to be anything but comfortable. The
dinner had all been cooked on Saturday and was
cut up and piled on the table in the center of
the room, and we served ourselves. I could not
help thinking of the time when my Soldier had
been served by butlers and waiters, each anxious
to be the first to anticipate his wishes, and all
feeling amply rewarded for every effort by a
pleasant word or an appreciative smile. J wondered how any one of those obsequious attendants would feel to see us now.
The following menu was about the average
dinner (with the exception, of course, that onweek-days it was warm): Corned beef, mutton
pie, potato salad, pickled snap-beans, gooseberry tarts and milk. Our breakfast was always
cold; the first one was cold bread, preserves, a
baked partridge (which is the same as our
pheasant), and delicious coffee and butter.
Our rooms had one discomfort: we were
awakened every morning by the young lady,
who made love to the bird of her preacher beau
while she arranged his room.
"Dear 'ittle birdie!—birdie dot a Dod?—~
birdie dot a soul?—ittle birdie sings praises to
Doddie?"
A sound as of the door opening, a rustling
and a confused "Oh, dear!' and then "Good
morning" was followed by the invariable excuse
for not having finished tidying up the room and
eage before he came, "because birdie and I are
such friends—ain't we, birdie?—and time slips
so quickly—don't it, birdie?"
I would know she was being forgiven, though
! could hear only the sounds of his deep, low
tones between the chirping to—hirdie, of course.
Neither my husband nor I meant to listen to
these chirpings to—birdie, of course, and I always put my fingers in his ears at the sound of
them.
After our breakfast was over and baby had
been made comfortable, I usually sent him outfor his walk with Annie McCarthy, his new
nurse, who was delighted at having him all to
herself,
"Shure, and I'll not be having the interfarence
of so many others whose rasponsability I don't
be a-wanting; for the bairn, God save him, was
afther being that kissed, his dinner wouldn'
agray with him at all, at all. There was the
cook and John's wife and John and the coachman and that ugly French Lizette (sorra a bit
am I to be rid of her, the vain prig) would be
all afther kissing him until he'd be that sick his
milk would curdle in him, and for the loife of me
I couldn't be kaping the elothes clane on him
with all their crumpling and handling; and it's
glad that I am entirely, the saints save us, having him to mesilf, the blissed child!"
The rooms were comfortable, and we found
the long veranda, where we spent our evenings
and most of our mornings, not only a very pleasant change, but a source of amusement as well.
My curiosity was greatly excited concerning our
neighbors on the left. I was uncertain how
many there were of them, though I put them
down in my mind as not less than half a dozen.
The first morning these "Left-handers," as I
called them, were as silent as the grave till
about noon, when, all at once, without any premonitory noises, they began a most animatedconversation, interspersed with laughter, mirthful and seornful. The tones of their voices
would change from anger to reproach and then
to grief, so that at one time I was so full of
sympathy with the poor man who was being
driven out into the cold world that it was all I
could do to refrain from going in and pleading
for him; but while I was hesitating the trouble
ceased, I supposed he was gone and all was
over with him, and involuntarily offered up a
prayer—the only help I could give.
Imagine, if you can, my surprise when the
next morning at a little later hour I heard a
repetition of the same painful scene. The poor
man had returned, I reasoned. Taking them
all together, I thought they certainly were a
most peculiar family, and I determined to enlist my husband's interest when he returned.
Something had prevented my telling him the
day before. That evening as we were sitting on
the veranda I carried my resolution into effect
and, though he listened with his usual sweet
patience, my description of the disturbance, to
my surprise, excited in him more mirth than
sympathy.
Just as I had finished tellmg my story, our
baby was brought in to be enjoyed and put to
sleep. "The little pig went to market," "the
mouse ran up the clock," "the cock-horse" wasridden "to Banbury Cross," and after innumerable "Hobble-de-gees,'"' baby was ready, and so
were we, for his "Bye Baby Bunti
ing ours grew fainter and fainter, we began tc
sing in the Chinook jargon the Lord's Prayer,
which my husband had taught the Indians on the
Pacific coast, and which we always sang at the
last to make baby's sleep sound. At the words,
"Kloshe mika tumtum kopa illahie, kahkwa
kopa saghalie"' (Thy will be done on earth as
it is in heaven), from through the open door
of the room to our left a voice clear and sweet
joined in the same jargon with ours to "Our
Father," and as the last invocation was chanted,
"Mahsh siah kopa nesika konaway massachie—
Kloshe kahkwa" (Send away from us all evil—
Amen), a handsome stranger stepped out and,
with outstretched hand, said to my Soldier, with
great cordiality, "IXKlahowya sikhs, potlateh
lemah" (low do you do, friend; give me your
good hand). Then followed a conversation between them about the Pacific coast, Fort Vancouver, San Juan Island, Puget Soar the Sno-
homish tribe and their many mutual friends of
the Salmon Illehe.
All the while I was wondering what could
have become of the other family—if they had
gone—and yet now and then I caught a tone inour visitor's voice as he talked to my Soldier,
that sounded very similar to the tones of the
man in trouble belonging to them, though I did
not see how it would be possible for any one to
drive, or wish to drive, him out of one's home.
When, after awhile, I came in for the compliments of the season, my astonishment knew no
bounds when I learned that he had been the sole
occupant of that room since Sunday night.
The cloek in the court struck seven. Rising .
hastily, and with many apologies, this strange-
family man wrote something on his card, and
handing it to my husband, said, "I am playing
at the theater here to-night—come and see me,"
and was gone.
To this kind stranger, William Florence, I
was indebted for my first taste of the pleasures
of the theater. Almost every evening he joined
us on the veranda, shared our play with baby,
cheered and entertained the General, and kindly
took us afterward to see the play. Yet, during
the whole of his stay—four days—he never once,
in the most remote way, intruded himself upon
eur confidence; and though he knew there was
some mystery, in his innate delicacy he made
no allusion to it.
On Saturday evening, when his engagement
was over and he came to say good-bye, after
lingering over the pleasant evenings we hadpassed together, and putting great stress upon
the benefit they had been to him, he stopped
abruptly, saying:
"Confound it all! Forgive me, if I put my
foot in it—but here is something to buy a rattle
for the youngster. I swear I absolutely have no
use for it. In facet, I never had so much money
at one time before in my whole life, and it belongs by rights to the young rascal; for, if it had
not been for the 'cat's in the fiddle, the 'cow
jumping over the moon,' 'getting the poor dog a
bone, and 'Our Father who art in heaven,' I
should have spent every red cent of it on the fellows. Please—I insist," he said, as my husband
refused. "I know you have had more money
than you seem-to be bothered with now; take
this."
Though we were both very much touched by
the kind generosity of this stranger in a strange
land, my Soldier was firm in his refusal.
"Well, good-bye and good luck to you," he
said. "You are as obstinate as an 'allegory on
the banks of the Nile' Here it goes," putting
the fifty dollars back into his pocket, and turning to me, with a tone I so well remembered, he
wished me happiness.
"Good-bye," I said; "may 'Our Father' who
art in heaven and his little ones of whom he
says 'suffer to come unto me,' keep your heartthoughtful for others, and gentle and kind all
through this life. Believe in soul and be very
sure of God."
In all the years that came afterward the
friendship formed then between my husband
and our first '"Left-hander" was never broken
—and to me it was a legacy.
The following week I noticed his rooms were
taken by a lady and gentleman whose actions
were very strange. I saw there were two of
them this time. The second evening, as I was
putting baby, who was unusually restless and
fretful and would not be amused or comforted,
to sleep, the queer lady, with a '"Banquo-isburied-and-can-not-come-out-of-his-grave" tone and
manner, came in and said, "The child—is't ill,
or doth it need the rod withal?' Whether the
child needed "the rod withal" or Mrs. Winslow's
soothing syrup, he stopped erying at once and,
while she talked on, he never took his startled
eyes from her face till he wearily closed them,
hypnotized to sleep.
"Wast thou a nurse—one that thou call'st
trustworthy?" she asked, after I had put the
haby in his little bed.
"Yes, madam," I answered, 'one whose love
makes her so."
"Tt is well" she said, "and if thou dost not
fear to leave the watch with her, wilt thou andthy husband come as our guests to see our Hamlet as we have conceived him to be?"
It was the first of Shakespeare's plays I had
ever seen, and my blood ran cold as I breathlessly watched the portrayal of it by these, the
most celebrated actors of their day (Charles
Kean and his wife, Ellen Tree), with talents so
versatile that I cried over the tragedy as if my
heart would break, and laughed with equal
heartiness over "Toodles," the faree which followed.
At the close of the play the actress brought
her husband into the box and introduced him.
Unlike her, he did all his acting on the stage;
she stabbed her potatoes and said, "What! nob-e-a-n-s ?"
We accepted their kind invitation to share
their carriage back to the house, and enjoyed,
too, some of the delicious supper prepared for
them. It was their last year on the stage, and
I never saw them again, though I treasure their
little keepsake, given me in exchange for one
not half so pretty, and gratefully remember the
pleasure they put into our lives during the days
they were our "Left-handers."
Among others, there came in time that king
of comedians, noble in mind as he was perfect
in art, Joe Jefferson. This pleasant acquaintance did not end with our Canadian experience.The next time we saw Joe Jefferson he gave a
performance in Richmond and turned over the
whole proceeds to a war-ruined Confederate
who had assisted him in early days, all in such
a quiet manner as to fulfill the spirit of the
Scriptural injunction regarding the right and
left hands. The kindness which was shown by
the wealthy tobaceonist—the seeming favorite
of fortune—to the poor lad in the beginning of
that career the distinction of which, even then,
could be foretold, was thus gracefully repaid
a thousand times by the successful actor. .
Our landlady made a tour of inspection of all
the rooms every Iriday, but to us she made her
visits longer each time, showing a growing interest in our affairs. She could not solve the
mystery of our having come from such a
palatial home to her boarding-house. Then, too,
one of my "shilling visitors" happening to be
the Governor-General and another an English
officer, they were also a cause of wonder. She
was so insistent in this unbounded curiosity
that we were compelled to seek a larger house
where we should be more lost to sight, especially
as just at this time two prominent Southern
gentlemen, Mr. Beverly Tucker and Mr. Beverly
Saunders, had been gagged and taken through
the lines, though their release was immediately
demanded by the English government.Much to my husband's relief, I volunteered to
assume the disagreeable task of notifying her,
which notice she seemed intuitively to have anticipated and determined to thwart by telling
of her troubles, all of which she laid at her husband's door.
"He is got so high-minded now," she said, "he
refuses to blacken all the boots at night—leaves
the top floor ones till morning. Wants to set
upstairs with me and the girls, instead of staying down in the kitchen, looking for chaws and
to be handy; expects us to lnunt tins to shine and
mend, and nails to drive; won't eat the boarders'
leavings; reads the Stateser's newspaper that
he sends to his girl; sets on it when he hears us
coming; took money from Stateser, too, and
was that sly he was going to spend it on himself,
and I giving him all he needs."
Taking advantage of her pause for sympathy,
I edged in my notice. She immediately put all
the blame of our going on "that Johnson," and,
though I assured her that he had nothing whatever to do with it, wailed:
"You can't fool us, you can't fool us——he
drives every boarder out of the house."
Our next rooms opened on the Champs de
Mars, the attractions of which in part made up
for the loss of the veranda, but not for that of our
"Left-handers," who had made oases in our lives.OME, look at the soldiers," I said, as I
saw a shadow in the General's smile and
heard a sigh when the music, almost under our very windows, signaled the hour for
dress-parade.
The shadowy ghost of despair vanished with
my entreaties, as we stood at the window and
watched the soldiers, keeping time with them to
step and tune outwardly, while hiding the
muffled sound within, each playing we were enjoying it, without one marring thought of the
crumpled-browed past, trying to fool each other
till we really fooled ourselves. It was with
thankfulness that I saw my Soldier watch with
unfeigned interest the maneuvers of the troops
day after day, and pleasantly welcome reveille
and tattoo. Our baby learned to march almost
before he walked.
While we were enjoying our congenial surroundings and each other, spite of poverty,
fears for the future, and grief for the past, my
husband became very ill. In the erisis of his
illness, when he required all my attention, our
baby was seized with croup. The kind old Englishman, recommended by my good friends, was
very attentive, but failed to inspire me with my
wonted faith. The chief reason, I think, must
have been that he was not called "Doctor," but
"Mister.' For two weeks he came once, and
sometimes twice a day, going first to see and
bring me news of the baby, who had been
kindly taken by our friends to their home to
be cared for. I was a souree of unending
amusement, an unsolvable mystery to the
English doctor, though we were very good
friends.
During all this long illness I never once
stopped to consider the eost of anything,
whether it were food, medicines or delicacies of
any kind, if prescribed or suggested, but purchased regardless of expense. When the danger was past, and our board bill was sent up, I
eounted over our little store and found there
was not enough left to meet it.
My husband was still too ill to be annoyed
or troubled about anything, and with the bill
hidden away in my pocket, I was making a plan
of battle and maneuvering how I could fight my
way out of the intrenchments, when he noticedthat I was looking pale, and suggested that I
go out for a little fresh air.
HNagerly taking advantage of the excuse thus
offered, I put on my bonnet and went down to
the office and took from my box in the safe an
old-fashioned set of emeralds and, asking the
proprietor to direct me to the most reliable
jeweler and to send some one to sit with my husband until my return, went out.
I had had very little experience in buying of
merehants, and none whatever in selling to
them, but I feigned great wisdom and dignity
as ] told the young man who stepped forward to
wait upon me that my business was with the
head of the firm. He took me back to an inner
office, where an old man with grizzly-gray hair
and a very moist countenance was looking intently, through something which very much resembled a napkin-ring screwed into his right
eye, at some jewels lying on a tray before him.
H{e wore his teeth on the outside of his mouth,
and his upper lip was so drawn, in the intensity
of his look, as to be almost hidden under his
over-reaching nose. His face, too, was wrinkled
up into a thousand gullies in his concentration
upon his work.
"We don't hemploy young women 'ere," he
said, looking up and frowning as he suddenly
became aware of my presence."T came," I explained, taking out my emeralds
and handing them to him, "to ask you if you
would not, please, sir, kindly buy some of these
stones from me, or, at least, advance me some
money on them."
"This is not a pawnbroker's shop, heither,
mum," he replied, as he carefully examined the
jewels, and then, suddenly popping the napkin-
ring out of his eye, turned both of the piercing
little gray twinklers upon me and said:
"Where did you get these hemeralds from,
miss?"
"T was born with them, sir," I said indignantly.
Kither from my appearance, or for some
other cause, he became suddenly suspicious, and
not only would not purchase them of me, but
refused to let me have them till I could prove
my right to them. J was too young and inexperienced to be anything but furious, and the
bitter, sealding tears that anger sometimes unlocks to relieve poor woman's outraged feelings,
were still falling fast when I reached the hotel
with the clerk whom the jeweler had sent back
with me that I might prove by the proprietor
my ownership of the jewels with which I was
born.
He, in his sympathy, shared my anger and,
after expressing his sincere regret that I shouldhave been subjected to such an indignity, advised, as he snatched the ease from the clerk
with a withering look of scorn translated into
more emphatic language, that I should look
carefully over them to be sure that neither this
hireling nor his master had abstracted any of
the stones, for his experience had been that
suspicion was born of guilt.
As he again locked up my emeralds in his safe
le kindly asked how much money I needed and
hegged that in the future I would permit him
to advance for me if I should need any, and
furthermore, "as to the board and expenses
here," he said, "Mr. Edwards and I will arrange
all that when he is well—entirely well." My
friends would have been glad to advance me the
money but I did not wish to trouble them.
Through the goodness of God and the skill of
my kind physician, my loved ones were spared
to me, and one day, some time after they were
well, as I was reading the paper to my husband,
I chanced across an advertisement for a teacher
of Latin in Miss MeIntosh's school. The professor was going abroad and wanted some one
to take his place during his absence. The
chuckle of delight which I involuntarily gave
as I read it, provoked from my Soldier the remark that I was keeping something very good
all to myself. I slyly determined that this littlesuspicion should be verified and that I would
make an application at once for the position;
then, if I should fail, I alone would suffer from
the disappointment. So, just as soon as I could
arrange it, I donned my best clothes, assumed
a most dignified mien, went to the number advertised and asked for the professor.
I was shown into the primmest of parlors—
the kind of room one feels so utterly alone in,
without even the suspicion of a spirit around
to keep your own spirit company. Each piece
of furniture was placed with mathematical precision, and all was ghost-proof. The proprietress, who came in response to my call, seemed
put up in much the same order. She was tall
and angular, and her grizzly-red hair was arranged in three large puffs (like fortifications,
I thought) on each side of her long, thin face,
high cheek-bones, Roman nose, and eyes
crowded up together under gold-rimmed spectacles. As she held my ecard in her hand and
looked at me with a narrow-gauge gaze, piercing my inmost thoughts, and with that discouraging "Well !-what-can-I-do-for-you?" expression, I felt all my courage going. My necessities aroused me from my cowardice, and I said
as bravely as I could:
"T have had the good fortune to read your
advertisement, madam, in the paper this morn-ing, and have come in answer to it. May I seethe professor?"
Looking curiously at my ecard and then over
her glasses at me, she said:
"The advertisement was for a teacher, not
for a pupil."
"Tam perfectly aware of that,' I answered,
"and came in response, to offer the professor
my services as a teacher."
A most quizzical expression bunched up the
corners of her mouth and wiggled across her
httle colorless eyes as she said:
"T will send the professor down to you."
Looking over her spectacles again, as if for a
verification of her first impression of me, she
left the room.
Returning after a little while, she said:
"The professor requested me to ask if you
would be so good as to come up into the recitation room."
I saw as soon as I had entered that a description of me had preceded my coming, and not
a very flattering one, either, I judged, from the
faces of the professor and the pupils.
The class consisted of fourteen young ladies,
all of them apparently older than I was. The
professor finished the sentence he was translating on the board, rubbed it out, wiped his hands
on the cloth, replaced it, came forward and wasduly presented by Miss MeIntosh, who remained
in the room. He had a pleasant, round, smooth
face, a bald head and large gray eyes, was short
and stout, with a sympathetic, cultured voice
and manner.
"Miss McIntosh tells me you came in reply
to my advertisement. 1 have been forced to advertise in order to save time, as my going
abroad is unexpected and brooks no delay."
"T am very glad you had no option but to
advertise, else it might not have been my good
fortune to know of, and respond to, your wants,
sir?
"And you have really come to apply for the
position?" he asked.
"T have, sir."
The expression on Miss MeIntosh's face, the
nudging and suppressed titter among the pupils
which this answer brought forth was not caleu-
lated to lessen my embarrassment.
"Have you had any experience in teaching?"
"No, sir," I said.
"May I ask where you were educated?"
"IT was graduated at Lynchburg College."
"Ts that in England?"
"Oh, no, sir," said J, with astonishment at his
ignorance, and then recollecting myself just as
I was about to inform him that Lynchburg was
the fifth town in population in Virginia, was onthe south bank of the James River, one hundred
and sixteen miles from the capital of the State,
and within view of the Blue Ridge Mountains
and Peaks of Otter, I stopped short, embarrassed by my imprudence. The professor, taking no notice of my confusion, went on to say:
"And so you were graduated there? My
class here has just finished Cesar. Do you remember how Cesar commences?"
"Yes, sir,' I said, and repeated: "Gallia est
omnis divisa in partes tres."
"You have the Continental pronunciation, J
see."
He gave me several sentences to translate;
then an ode from Horace and some selections
from Catullus and Tibullus. By this time the
pupils were silent, and Miss MeIntosh's expression was changed.
He then asked me to write and parse a sentence, which I did, saying sotto voce as he took
the chalk from me:
"That was a catch question."
"Please translate and parse this," said he,
without noticing my aside, and he wrote in
Latin, "The late President of the United States
said 'nobody is burt Ay
Before he wrote any further, instead of translating, I looked up at him and said:
"But, oh, sir! somebody was hurt."Quickly he cleared the board, put down the
cloth, wiped his hands, turned his face to me
and offering his hand, said, not to my surprise,
because I had faith in prayer, but rather to that
of Miss MeIntosh and the young ladies:
"T will engage you, Mrs. Edwards, and will be
responsible for you."
We went down to the parlor, and I gave him
the names of the only friends I had in Montreal
of whom he could make inquiries regarding me.
The next day I gave my first lesson to the class.
T beeame very fond of them all and, after my
embarrassment of the first few days, got along
very well with them.
My Soldier was curious to know where I went
every day, but, knowing it gave me great pleasure to be thus mysterious, humored me and
asked no questions.
My first month's salary was spent in part
payment on an overcoat for him, and only Our
Father and the angels know what joy filled my
heart, that with the work of my hands I could
give him comfort. Then my secret was out.
I was sorry when the cold weather came.
The snows not only put an end to the military
reviews, but covered up the beautiful green.
There were very few diversions for us, but I
was just as happy as it was possible for me to
he. Indeed, those were the very happiest daysof my whole life and 1 was almost sorry when
General Rufus Ingalls wrote to my Soldier, in-
closing a kind personal letter from General
Grant, together with the following official assurance of his safety:

General Grant also wrote that it had not been
at all necessary for us to go away in the first
place, and that the terms of his cartel should
have been respected, even though it had necessitated another declaration of war.
We stopped in New York en route to Virginia, expecting to remain there only three or
four days, but we found that our board had beenpaid in advance for two weeks, that a carriage
had been put at our service for that length of
time, and that in our box was a pack of wine-
vards marked "Paid." To this day I do not
know how many people's guests we were, for a
great many of my Soldier's old army friends
were there at the time, and they all vied with
each other in making us happy.een cut, even
the annuities in the ey cemetery aay been
broken, but it was home and we loved it. The
river and the woods and our own garden supplied our table. We planted vines to wind lovingly around the melancholy stumps of the old
oaks and elms which had fallen victims of the
randalism of war. In our own flowers my Soldier found the perfumes that he loved. He
gathered geranium leaves to keep around him,
scattered rose-petals through his bureau
drawers, and put fragrant blossoms into bags
and laid them in the folds of his clothing. In
war-time a friend going North asked him,
'What shall I bring you?"
"A bottle of new-mown hay and a bottle of
heliotrope,' was the reply.
ded in Historie R 2
State capital, established in the reign
of George IT, on land belonging to Colonel Byrd,
is its county-seat. Brandon, the home of the
Harrisons; Shirley, the home of the Carters;
and Westover, the home of the Byrds, where
Arnold landed on the 4th of January, 1781, and
proceeded on his march toward Richmond, are
neighboring plantations. Malvern Hill, where
one of our internecine battles was fought, ad-
joms Turkey Island.
Not far distant is the famous Duteh Gap
Canal, the useful legacy which Butler left to the
State of Virginia, and which, in the advantages
it gave the commonwealth, to some extent
atoned to my Soldier for the destruction of the
Pickett home.
Diverting his troops for a time from wanton
spohation, Butler set them to digging a canal
at Duteh Gap to connect the James and Appomattox, thereby shortening by seven miles the
road to Richmond, and placing the State traffic
under a permanent obligation to his memory.
To protect his men while they worked he sta-tioned his prisoners in the trench beside them,
in order that the Confederates might not vield
to the otherwise irresistible temptation to fire
upon them.
Butler may not have been gifted with that
fascinating suavity of demeanor which renders
a man an ever-sparkling ornament to society,
but from a practical business point of view he
was not wholly destitute of commendable qualities. His Dutch Gap Canal is not only a lasting monument to his progressive spirit, but a
benefit to commerce and an interesting feature
which has attracted visitors from many nations.
Out on a point of the plantation, back from
the river in a clump of trees—the beginning of
the big woods—is still standing a most interesting monument. The top of it was broken off
by Butler's troops in a search for hidden treasure. It was erected by William and Mary Randolph in 1771. The following is a copy of the
inseription on one of its sides:
''The foundation of this pillar was laid in 1771,
when all the great rivers of this country were swept
by inundations never before experienced; which
changed the face of nature and left traces of their
violence that will remain for ages.''
My first visit to this monument is one of the
sweetest memories of my Turkey Island life.I had gone with my husband to hunt rabbits
and birds—a hunt more for the meat than the
sport in those poverty-stricken days when our
larders were greatly dependent upon the water
and the woods.
The day was fine and the dew was yet
glistening as we came suddenly and without
warning within touch of the gray broken
monument shut in and surrounded by the great
forest trees. In silence and solemn awe, in
the strange light and sudden coolness beneath
the shadows my hero-soldier stacked bis gun
and, raising his hat, gently and silently reached
for my hand. I slipped it into his and drew
elose to him. Birds were singing in the distance.
"God's choir,' he said, and in his beautiful
voice sang his favorite hymn, "Guide me, oh,
thou great Jehovah." Then he taught me these
lines:
""The groves are God's first temples. Ere man
learned
To hew the shaft and lay the arehitrave,
And spread the roof above them,—ere he framed
The lofty vault to gather and roll back
The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood,
Amidst the cool and silenee, he knelt down
And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks
And supplieation."'"Is not that monument one of the oldest in
Virginia?" I asked my Soldier.
"No," he said. "There are many older, but
the oldest one in the United States, I believe, is
one erected to a poor fellow who died on what
was to be your birthday in the centuries to come.
Jt is on the banks of Neabseo Creek in Fairfax
County. Onee when I was on furlough Snelling
and I came across it and copied the epitaph.
The poor fellow was a companion of John
Smith. The inscription on the monument simply said:
'Flere lies ye body of Lieut. William Herris,
who died May 16, 1608, aged 65 years; by birth a
Briton: a good soldier, a good husband and neighbor.' "'
These rambles over the fields and woods,
through the clover and sweetbrier, keeping step
and chattering with my Soldier where he, as a
boy, had often tramped with his father, are
among the blessedest of my blessed memories.
My Soldier's classic taste and perfect harmony
and simple, pure heart made him a true lover
of nature and the trees and the plants, the
stones, the sod, the ground, the waters, the sky,
and all living animals were his kin.
Though my warrior was a lion in battle, he
was gentle, amiable, good-humored, affectionateand hospitable in his home. The same exuberant and hopeful spirit which cheered and encouraged his soldiers in the field was felt in his
home life. All the world is witness to his
patriotism and unselfishness, as he offered his
life for the suecess of the cause in which he had
faith. He was never disheartened by the most
complicated difficulties. Unspoiled by fame,
just and loyal, he deserved the love he received,
for he was worshipped by his family, idolized
by his soldiers, honored by all parties and all
nations—my brave warrior, as simple as a child,
as high-minded as he upon whom the word-
magician said, "Every god did seem to Sch reseal, to give the world assurance of a man.'
Soon after the surrender dive of

He tried to turn his sword into a plowshare,
but he was not expert with plowshares and,
worse, he constantly received applications for
employment from old comrades no more skilled
than he. All were made weleome, though theymight not be able to distinguish a rake from a
rail fence or know whether potatoes grew on
trees or trellised vines. They would get up
when they felt like it, linger over breakfast, go
out to the fields, and if the sun was too hot or
the wind too cold they would come back to sit
on the veranda or around the fire till dinner
was ready. Then they would linger at table
telling war stories until it was unanimously de-
eided to be too late for any more work that day.
There were Generals, Colonels, Majors, Cap-
jains, Lieutenants, privates, all of one rank
now, and he who desired a graphic history of
the four years' war needed only to listen to the
conversation of the agricultural army at Turkey
Island. The inevitable soon came. Resources
were exhausted and proprietor and guests were
forced to seek other fields.
One of our friends was a veteran who had
lost an eye in the Mexican war and had served
in the Confederate Army. All that was left of
his magnificence was his pride, which had grown
strong and rugged on misfortune. It was diffi-
eult to do anything for him. He would never
admit his needs and any reference thereto was
likely to give offense. He had visited us for a
time and when urged to stay had resolutely de-
elined. My Soldier was very anxious to help
him, but fearful of wounding him. Walkingdown with him to take the steamer to Richmond my Soldier, unobserved, took a ten-dollar
gold piece from his pocket and dropped it in
the road, hoping that the old Major would find
it. But the veteran walked by without secing it.
So his friend was compelled to find it himself.
Three times the ruse was played and at last the
Major saw the eoin and, picking it up, offered
it to his companion. 'No, it belongs to you,"
said the General. 'You must have dropped it,"
urged the Major. "I?" was the query. "How
could I have a gold piece?) The Yankees are
about the only people who have been down in
this country with gold, and now that you have
found it, it belongs to you." After a long discussion the Major was induced to accept the law
that "finders is owners," and he put the gold in
his pocket.At a dinner given by the Governor to George
Augustus Sala, the English correspondent, Mr.
Sala asked:
"General Pickett, whom do you regard as the
hero of the battle of Gettysburg, on the northern side?"
Y.
im say that not the Gen-
als but the men in the ranks fought the battles.
This reminded me of a story, which I told
them:

mg the visitors at our home at Turkey
Island was Mr. R. M. T. Hunter. I well remember his grave but genial face, beardless,
marked with deep lines wrought by years ofstudy and care. Those who do not recall him
may look at the pictured face of former Senator John W. Daniel, of Virginia, and gain
an idea of his appearance. His long hair, almost touching his shoulders, gave him an air
that would seem quaint to one aceustomed to
the closely cropped heads of the present day.
Ilis extensive acquaintance with publie hfe,
formed in the Congress of the United States
and that of the Confederacy, had secured for
him an inexhaustible fund of anecdote which
his ready wit displayed to good effect, and his
vein of humor made him always a welcome
companion. His ability to deal with weighty
subjeets is indicated by the remark of Senator
Wigfall, "I don't know what we Southern men
would do without Hunter; he is the only one
among us who knows anything about finance."
As a child his gravity and fondness for books
led his old mammy to say, "Li'l Marse Robert
gwine ter be a gre't man; he's so lonesome in
his ways."
Mr. Hunter knew men, and was the first to
discover the genius of Stonewall Jackson. Ina letter written to my Soldier near the beginning of the war he congratulated the South on
the possession of so great a military man as
jeneral Jackson. IIe was one of those whom
Mr. Lincoln wished to see in Richmond afterthe surrender, expressing confidence in his
honesty and his influence with the Southern
people, a meeting which was prevented by the
absence of Mr. Hunter from Richmond at the
time, and for which there was no later oppor-
tumity because of the tragie end of the President's great life.
Some of the Northern officers who had
seen little, uf any, of Southern plantation life,
visited us and were deeply interested in the
characteristic features of our domestic circle.
They found much amusement in the original
repartee of the negroes, liking to ask them
questions and diseuss with them' subjects of
everyday life. General Ingalls saw an old
negro coming in with a large number of
terrapin.
"What a lot of terrapin and what immense
ones, Uncle Tom! How much do you get for
them, and where do you sell them?"
"Vas, sui; dey is 'mense 'case dey's freshwater tarepin; salt water ones is littler. I gits
ober en above a couple er ninepences apiece fer
em, en I sells 'em up in Richmon' ter Mr. Mon-
tero, de gambler gemman. You mus' 'scuse me,
Marsa, fer answerin' you in retail."
"Why, Uncle Tom, you could get over a dollar apiece for these terrapin in New York," General Ingalls replied.Uncle Tom pointed to a bucket of water and
looking at the General said:
"Yas, suh, Marsa; I spec' dat's so. En, suh,
ef I had dat pail er water in hell I could git a
inillion er dollars fer it."
The visitors were also amused by the division
of the plantation property, as explained by the
servants,
"Whose horse is that?" asked General Tom
Pitcher of one of the boys "mindin' de cows."
"Dat hawss? W'y, Marsa, hawsses allers
longs ter de men-folks, so cou'se dat hawss
belongs ter Marse George."
"And whose cows are those?"
"De woman-folks allers owns de cows, so
cou'se dey's Miss Sally's cows."
"Whose chickens are those in the yard?"
"Dey's woman's t'ings, too, en cou'se dey's
Miss Sally's."
"To whom do those mules belong?"
"Dey's jest only mules en dey don' hab no

Looking up General Pitcher saw a flock of
wild ducks flying across the river in delightful
irresponsibility.
"Whose ducks are those?" he asked.The boy looked up and turned toward the
General with an expression of scorn.
"Dey's dey own ducks," he asserted emphatically. "Lawd, Marsa, whar you been all yo' life
not ter know dat wile ducks is dey own ducks?"
Going down the river one day with my Soldier, his brother Charlie, and their sister, in a
boat rowed by the overseer, I had what I
thought an interesting illustration of the tenacity of childish habits of thought. Mr. Sims
had been overseer on the Pickett plantation in
the childhood of the two sons of the family, who
used to follow him around and absorb knowledge from what they looked upon as fathomless
depths of intellect and experience. 'They were
catching terrapin and my Soldier looked at the
eatch in the bottom of the boat.
"Mr. Sims, why is it that these terrapin are
of such different markings?" he asked with a
recurrence of the old-time attitude of mental
dependence. "They come from the same water,
are grown in the same conditions, and seem in
every way alike except that the color markings are different. There is a reason; what
is 1¢?"
"Vas, George," said the old man, "of course
there is a reason for it, it's jest this way with
them tarepins; I've allers noticed they are different. I've been catchin' tarepins off an' onall my hfe an' I've allers seen 'em that way.
Some's streaked an' some's eriss-crossed an'
some's plain an' some has diamon's on 'em an'
that's jest the reason. They's jest made that
way."
"T see now," said my Soldier in all seriousness and good faith. 'J suppose that is the reason. I have often wondered about it and this
is the first time I ever understood it."
After all the years and the wars and the for-
cign travel and the changes he had uneon-
sciously gone back to the blind confidence of
ehildhood.
Adjoining Turkey Island was the plantation
of Colonel William Allen (Buck Alen), Curl's
Neck. General Sehofield and some other officers of the United States Army, among them
Colonel! Day, drove down from Richmond, visiting old battlefields and shooting ducks and partridges, and were guests at Curl's Neck. At
the invitation of my Soldier they came to our
home. Colonel Day had never before seen my
Soldier and he afterward thus expressed his
feeling upon first meeting the warrior whom he
had hitherto known only by reputation:
"Imagine my surprise when, instead of the
dashing, rollicking fire-eater whom T expected to
see in the hero of the greatest charge in modern history, T touched glasses of apple-toddywith the gentle George Pickett. 1 was impressed above all with his quiet demeanor, his
warm-hearted hospitality and gentleness. I
stood in speechless wonder, trying to reconcile
the man before me with my preconceived idea
of the great warrior. It might all be summed
up in the explanation that 'the bravest are the
tenderest.' "White House. The Southern train, usually
late, was on time for once, and we came out
of the station just as the President's carriage
appeared,
"Hello, Pickett!" he called out. "Up to your
old war tricks, coming in ahead of the train!"
The President referred to an incident of the
war; my Soldier, wishing to go from Hanover
Junction to Richmond, applied to General Lee
for a pass. At that time the ears were so
erowded that travel by rail was not permitted
except on official business or by special permission. General Lee, just boarding the train
from Richmond on military duty, referred him
to the Adjutant-General. As there was not
time to visit the Adjutant and be in Richmond
. rnd ve, Pion
vir, ie eteat the desired hour, my Soldier mounted his
horse, Lucy, and rode into the city, waiting at
the station to salute General Lee as he stepped
from the train,
My first view of Washington was from the
President's carriage, though it could searcely
be called a view of the city, as the carriage
contained all my world and my attention was
more partiewlarly centered therein.
We were received with warm hospitality by
Mrs. Grant, who proved to be a charming
hostess, and all went well until night came, when
I was so afraid my baby would cry that I could
hardly sleep. The next day when my Soldier
spoke of my uneasiness the President, putting
his hat on the boy's head and his stick between
his legs, said:
"There, ride your horse and tell them you'll
cry as much as you please; that you own this
house."
One evening when we were reminiscing I told
Mrs. Grant of the first time I had seen her, and
my Soldier, who loved to tease me, repeated,
much to my dismay, my belligerent remarks
on that oceasion and the argument he had used
to curb my hostile demonstrations.
"And do you know, Pickett," the President
replied, relieving my embarrassment, "that
once we were foolish enough to think seriouslyof having an operation performed on her dear
eyes? We had consulted the best surgeons and
had been assured that it was a very simple thing
and not at all dangerous, so we decided to have
it done. As the time grew near I got to worrying over it, and the more I thought of it the
more I did not want my wife's eyes changed
even the least little bit from what they had
always been. Arrangements had been made;
the hour for the operation was almost at hand.
We were alone. I stood watching her collecting
the last little odds and ends and stealing my
pictures and the children's and putting them
into her handbag under her shawl. Everything
was ready and we started from the room. Aly
hand was on the knob of the door, when I
stopped and said:
"<«My dear, I am very selfish and ought not
to say this; but I don't want your eyes changed.
They look just as they did the first time I ever
saw them-—-the same eyes I looked into when I
fell in love with you—the same that looked up
into mine and told me that my love was returned. I have seen that expression in them
through all the years and I don't want it to be
lost. You might look better to other people, but
to me you are prettier as you are. So, if you
don't mind, please let's keep your dear eyes just
as they always have been'"She looked up in joyful surprise and replied:
"Why, it was only for your sake that I was
even thinking of having anything done, and if
you feel in that way about it 1—L
"Well, Pickett, I was glad and she was glad.
I untied the bonnet-strings, threw the bonnet
onto the floor, I think, and took her by the
hand and we turned and walked back into the
room as light-hearted as a pair of children on
their first picnic."
"Untied the bonnet-strings!" exclaimed Mrs.
Grant. "You just pulled them into a hard knot,
then broke them and threw the bonnet onto the
floor."
He reached over and patted her hand, and
the President of the United States gazed upon
the same eyes that lad looked their love into
those of the young captain in the years agone
and had become more precious to him with the
passing of time.
Mrs. Grant's morning receptions in the blue
room, in which she was assisted by the President, were very popular, chiefly because of her
unfailing good nature, which had the effect of
putting others in a good humor with themselves
and the world. It may be that you have met
people whose apparently permanent condition
of mind led you to think that they were averse
to being put into a good humor and would pre-fer to avoid the society of those who could et-
fect such a revolution. That is a delusion.
There is no one who does not like to be in a
good temper or fails to experience a pleasant
elow in the society of those who can produce
that novel condition.
The weakness of Mrs. Grant's eyes compelled
her to carry on her correspondence with the aid
of a secretary, one of the soldiers usually being
sent to her aid when she desired clerical assistance. It was before the day of the White House
"social secretary," writing to the first Lady of
the Land not being at that time so popular ¢
diversion as it has since become.
The charities and generous deeds of Mrs.
Grant were so quietly effected that the world
never knew of the good she accomplished. A
friend who was very close to her said that
her work ought to be made known to the publie
after she was gone, that it might live in memory
without wounding her modesty.
A home-like atmosphere pervaded the White
House, due to the President's habit of keeping
his official existence and his home life separate
and to the determination of Mrs. Grant to provide him with a place where official duties might
fall from his brain and pleasure and content
fill his heart. Here he was "Ulys" to "Mrs. Gas he called his heart-companion of many years,Here he listened to the confidences of his children, happy that they brought to him even
their inmost thoughts. At that time Fred was
a cadet at West Point and the younger children
were attending Washington schools.
Colonel Dent did his part toward keeping the
White House cheerful with the original of that
smile which has since been utilized for commer-
eial purposes. General Babeock could more
easily have passed for a politician than a soldier. General Porter's funereal face covered
a fountain of wit that was constantly bubbling
up, to the surprise and delight of those who had
been deceived by the preternatural gravity of
his expression. The President was criticized
by his opponents for keeping officers about the
White House, but when their martial phase was
so slightly in evidence I could not see why anyone should object.
Though General Grant was the soul of geniality with his intimate friends, to the public generally his reticence bad made him known as
"The Sphynx," or "the Great Unspeakable." If
one chanced to appeal to "the Sphynx" on a
subject in which he was interested he became as
fluent as the most loquacious of men. When he
was Commander of the United States Army a
gentleman who called upon him with a letter
of introduction from a friend of both, tried himupon two apparently interesting subjects without leading anywhere. As the visitor was about
to retire in despair it occurred to him to mention a fine horse owned by their friend. The
"Great Unspeakable' immediately became a
fountain of eloquence and an animated conversation followed, to the delight equally of the
General and his ealler.
The President told me in a gleeful way the
story of his first purchase of a horse. Speaking of his early dislike of military life and his
horror of war:
"T did not want to be a soldier. When my
father came home from town one day and surprised me with the information that I had received an appointinent to West Point I said, 'I
am not going. He looked at me and replied, '1
think you are.' Then I thought so, too. I don't
know what else I could have been. I should
probably not have succeeded in trade. My first
purchase was made when I was seven. <A neighbor had a horse which he was willing to sell for
twenty-five dollars. My longing for that horse
was so great that my father, though knowing
the price was too high, told me that I might
offer twenty dollars for it, and if the neighbor
would not take that I could offer twenty-two
and if that did not suffice I might pay the
twenty-five. So I went to the man and told himwhat my father had said. It would not be difti-
cult to solve the problem of the cost of that
horse. The boys got wind of the story and you
can unagine that for awhile life was not worth
tuuch to me.
"It may be that I lost money on that horse,
but the first dolar I ever earned was on a mule;
a circus mule. The ringmaster offered a dollar to anyone who should succeed in riding the
inule once around the ring. My mind was made
up to win that dollar. I promptly mounted the
animal and was as promptly deposited upon the
sawdust. Asking if I might have another trial
I was told that I might have as many as I
wanted. This time I mounted with my face
toward the mule's tail, which so disconcerted
him that he ambled peacefully around the ring
and I got the dollar."
At West Point Cadet Grant took the highest
leap reeorded in the history of the Academy.
One who witnessed the feat described the scene,
the clean-cut, blue-eyed young man who at the
call of the riding-master dashed out from the
ranks ona powerfully built chestnut sorrel horse
and rode to the end of the hall. Turning he galloped down the center toward a bar placed
higher than the head of a tall man standing.
Within a short distance of the bar the horse
paused and gathering all his strength for themighty effort vaulted over. Forty years later
Grant remembered the steed that had served
him so well and said, "York was a wonderful
horse." After the war, learning that his old riding-master was poor and helpless, General
Grant sent him a cheque.
The old soldier never claimed to have distinguished himself in scholarship at West Point,
but he must have made an impression of
strength upon those around him, for one of his
classmates, James A. Hardie, said, "If a great
emergency arises in this country durimg our
lifetime Sam Grant will be the man to meet it."
He had the simplicity characteristic of all
really great minds, and the directness of a soldier, going straight to his aim; he never either
overshot or undershot the mark. He spent apart of every day walking unattended along the
streets enjoying exercise and open air unhampered by guards, and his daily rides were also
usnally solitary, for in his racing buggy behind
his magnificent trotter, leaning over the dashboard to encourage his horse by a friendly word,
there was searcely anything in Washington that
could have kept him in view. Only once was he
passed in a race. His friend and clerk, Lien-
tenant Culver C. Sniffen, now a General on the
retired list, owned a fine horse and the President challenged him to a race. The Lieutenantdeclined, not wishing either to beat the President or be beaten by him. The President, with
ihe true sporting instinct, persisted until the
Lieutenant, fired with like emulation, yielded
and rode to win. He did win and the President
was very fond of telling the story of the only
tine he had ever lost a race.
General Grant had one sad memory connected
with a horse, dating back to the time when he
was a young officer in Mexico. He rode a bean-
tiful fierce untamable animal that in years past
had killed a number of would-be riders. <A
Mexican officer who was a skilled and daring
horseman had an ambition to mount the horse.
Lieutenant Grant, fearing for the safety of his
Mexiean friend, would not consent to his riding so dangerous a beast. The Mexican would
not let himself be dissuaded and the Lieutenant,
fearing that the friend might think that he did
not want him to ride his horse, ceased his opposition. The Mexican mounted and was thrown
and killed.
Occasionally when it could not be avoided the
President would curb his wild spirit sufficiently
to take a leisurely drive in Mrs. Grant's easy
carriage behind the tall and dignified black
coachman, Hawkins, attended by the almost
equally imposing footman, Jerry. Usually
this stately equipage was left to the unsharedenjoyment of Mrs. Grant and her guests. A
number of pleasant drives I took with my
hostess, sometimes into the country around
Washington, and sometimes to the Soldiers'
[Lome where the veterans bivouacked peacefully
until they should be mustered out of the earthly
army. The long rows of white wooden slabs
with black lettered names upon them brought
back vividly memories so new that they lay
near the surface of my heart.
It may be that to one familiar with the Washington of to-day the views of the city at that
time would have been marred by primitive
architectural features, but Nature had so far
done her best in the beginning that one might
well accept the opinion of Humboldt who, after
visiting all the cities of the known world, said
that for a site the entire globe does not hold its
equal. The youthful surveyor, long before he
became the "Father of his Country," wrought
well in fancy when gazing across the Potomae
he viewed the fair prospect with prophetic eye
and foresaw a stately capitol of a great nation
rising from one of its green hills. So well had
the capital city weathered the storm that had
almost wrecked the Ship of State that one who
had known it in war days might have found it
beautiful in comparison.
Inside the White House the deft fingers ofMartha Johnson Patterson had wrought miracles of adornment out of the web of her imagination, aided by a few simple materials which
in Jess skillful hands would have been ineffective. Within its walls life went on to the time
kept by Madison's clock that had ticked away
all the decades since the "Father of the Constitution" held guardianship over that compli-
eated child of many variegated phases.
General Grant, as head of the United States
Army, regarded his staff as his military family
and chose its members according to his desire.
As President he took a simuar view of his Cabinet, looking upon it as his civie family, and
did not cast a favorable eye upon recommenda-
tious made by politicians who wished to draw
upon him for the payment of their campaign
debts. Having no such debts of his own, being
tied to no party and bound by no pledges, he
felt free to select his associates as he thought
best, thereby incurring the ill-will of party
leaders who held their positions by heavy mortgages to office-seekers. I suppose soldiers have
an instinctive aversion to politicians, not only
because they make war but because they insist
upon managing it throughout its whole existence. Thus Grant sought his advisers in nonpolitical fields.
The President was severely criticized for hisappointment of Mr. A. T. Stewart as Secretary
of the Treasury, in contradiction to the "nine
statutes" which Mr. Conkling afterward found
to bar the way, but the wise statesmen of the
Senate confirmed the appointment with eager
promptness, and it could scarcely be demanded
that a soldier with more opportunity of knowing the regulations of battlefields than the
statutes that govern political administration
should be better informed as to civic laws than
those who have devoted a large part of their
lives to the study and framing of such laws.
Failing this appoitment Governor Boutwell, a
good friend of the President, was made Secretary of the Treasury, and it was as one of the
most trusted advisers in the Cabinet that I met
him.
The sympathies of President Grant were deep
and broad and sometimes presented humorous
phases. At a Cabinet meeting one day he
brought up the ease of a lawyer whom he
thought of appointing Chief Justice of one of
the territories, expressing pity for him because
he had lost a leg in battle. After an extended
silence the Attorney-General, Judge Rockwood
Hoar, quietly remarked, "Mr. President, it
seems to me that mere absence of legs is not
a sufficient qualification for judicial office.' The
other members looked apprehensive, but the
President laughed and said that he would think
of it further. The result of more mature reflection was that some one else was appointed,
presumably with the normal equipment of legs
and a fair endowment of unquestionable judicial
merit.
Attorney-General Rockwood Hoar was never
averse to expressing his sentiments in rugged
English, but his somewhat burry aspect and
speech covered a good healthy heart filled with
sympathetic impulses, Tis wit was a shining
blade that cut more deeply than he intended,
sometimes to his regret, but his eloquence on the
finer phases of life was a radiance of sunlight.
The true depth of his nature was shown in his
kindness to all who needed him.
The most impressive member of the Cabinet
was, quite appropriately, the head of the State
Department, Secretary Hamilton Fish. Six
feet tall, of distinguished bearing, with strong
face surmounted by dark curling hair, intense
eyes that seemed to look through the object of
their gaze, graceful and cultivated manner, he
was a noted figure in any assemblage. His
tact and statesmanship kept the country off the
diplomatic reefs on which it might have been
wrecked by a guiding hand less firm. President Grant said, "History will write that we
have had two great Secretaries of State, Gov-ernor Marey and Governor Fish." Mr. Fish
was always immaculately dressed, a distinctive
mark of his attire being a diamond breastpin,
which he always wore in his shirt. He succeeded the six-weeks' term of Mr. Elihu B.
Washburne, who was transferred to Paris and,
as Minister during the stormy period of the
Franco-Prussian War, gained the admiration
and confidence not only of his own country but
of Europe as well for his wise and patriotic
service
The Pres er often talked
of the war, i i
yeneral Grant was deeply interested in the
battle of Gettysburg, of which he knew only by
report. One day at the close of dinner he
asked my Soldier to explain certain movements
in the final charge. To make the inquiry plainer
he drew some lines on the table-cloth with the
handle of a spoon. My Soldier took the spoon
from the President's hand and drew upon the
cloth a diagram, briefly explaining as he went
along:
"Here is Seminary Ridge; there Cemetery
Ridge. Here is Round Top. This is Meade's
left; here, Meade's right. There are the Con-federate troops in the woods; here, Gettysburg.
There is the Fifth Corps. Here are the batteries, and there, Hall's Brigade. Here are
Cushing and Webb. Here is Clark's Brigade;
there, a railfenee. Here is the Third Brigade."
Lining off a space at one corner to enlarge
the vital point of the charge, he continued:
"Here is the turning point of the third day.
There, the stone wall we crossed. There is
Webb. Here is the Confederate assault. There
is where Armistead got over; here, where he
fell." Drawing his hand quickly across the corner beyond he added, "There is hell!"
"Bring me a blue pencil," said the President
toa servant. When it was brought he carefully
marked over the lines in the soft-laid cloth and
carried it into the smoking-room.
The tenderest memory I have of President
Grant, because it is the one closest to my heart,
is of him and my Soldier as they stood facing
each other in the President's office just before
the close of our visit. I can see them now looking earnestly into each other's eyes, one of General Grant's hands on the shoulder of his old
comrade and friend,
Grant, alwavs faithful to his friends, was urging upon my Soldier, whom the war had impoverished, the marshalship of the State of Virginia, which he was gratefully but firmly declin-ing. Later, when the devotion of the President
to his old friends and his confidence in them had
given his enemies an opportunity to criticize
with undue severity his habit of making appointments for friendship rather than politics,
T appreciated still more the generosity and wisdom of my Soldier's refusal. Knowing the demands upon the President, knowing that aecept-
ance of the appointment, sorely as he needed it,
would create for the administration a host of
enemies, he said:
"You eannot afford to do this for me, and I
cannot afford to let you do it."
"T can afford to do anything I choose," replied
the President.
I shall never forget the gratitude in my Soldier's tear-dimmed eyes as he turned them upon
the President, showing his appreciation of the
friendship and sacrifice, nor General Grant's
look in return, nor what those old soldiers did
-—-never, as silently shaking hands and walking
off in different directions they gazed out of separate windows, and I stole away.ONE evening just after the New York
steamer had blown her three whistles
in honor of my Soldier, as the river
steamers always did in passing our wharf, and
had gone around the bend, we saw Uncle Tom,
the faithful old negro fisherman, coming up
the hill with a bag over his stooping shoulders and talking to himself more excitedly than
usual,
"Good evening, Uncle Tom," I said, stepping
off the porch to greet him. "What have you in
your bag for me?"
"Tarepins—dat's what I got fer you, but I
got a piece of my mind fer Marse George, en ez
dis piece of mind mought not agree wid your
temperation I reckon you better g'long in de
house en sing some of dem song chunes while I's
mekin' a present of de piece of mind to Marse
George."
As my curiosity was greater than my fear
of mental indigestion, J stayed to share with
my Soldier the "piece of mind."
Uncle Tom proceeded to unfold his story to
the effect that a carpet-bagger who had come
to Bermuda Hundred was inciting the colored
people against my Soldier and planning with
them to visit us in foree. He said that he was
a brother of one of the same class of human
wreckage who had visited our community sometime before, selling to the negroes ointment that
was advertised to turn them into white people.
My Soldier had reported the enterprising merchant and, with Mr. "Buek" Allen and Colonel
John Selden, had taken to Richmond some boxes
of the ointment and some of the negroes to
whom the ointment had been sold, and the "ear-
pet-bagger" had been put in jail. His brother
was now inflaming the eredulous colored people
with the idea that my Soldier had caused the
disappointment of their ambitious aspirations.
The man who thus excited Uncle Tom's indignation and apprehension had lain in the river
with his vessel for weeks, sending out his
emissaries to tell the poor eredulous eolored
people that the United States government had
authorized him to promise that to every colored
man who would bring him a good bridle and
saddle, thereby showing his fitness for the possession, should be given a mule to fit the saddleand bridle, and that he would receive and receipt for the same every night between the
hours of midnight and daybreak. So suecess-
ful was this impostor that he had almost made
up his load before he was caught, and there
was hardly a bridle and saddle left in all the
surrounding country.
While my Soldier had confidence in Uncle
Tom, he did not much believe that the negroes
would dare make an attack upon him. He insisted, though, that I should not run any risk,
but should take our babies and go to Richmond
for a few days. Finding that no persuasion
could induce me to leave him, he consented
that we might wait together, fearing, yet not
believing, that they would come.
The third night after Uncle Tom's warning,
when we had begun to hope that he had after
all been misinformed, we heard a rapping at the
door and then a low growl.
"That's Rufus, rapping on the door with his
tail," said my Soldier. 'Ie hears something
and is warning us. Listen!'
He opened the door and the dog entered,
trembling and with great tears of fear in his
loyal eyes. We listened but heard nothing.
My Soldier came in and shut the door.
"Lay the baby down," he said, "and take this,
but keep it out of sight," handing me a pistol. His loaded gun was resting on a bracket just
above the door. Rufus stood pointing, his nose
nearly touching the panel of the door. My
heart seemed almost bursting from my throat
and sounded in my ear like the beating of a
drum. The baby smiled and dreamed aloud.
While we listened tensely there came the sound
of footsteps, the rolling of loose dirt and brickbats.
"Listen! They are coming around the back
way and across the ruins of the old house. 1
hear a number of steps, but they are uncertain
steps. Don't be afraid, dear; be your own
plucky little self."
"T am not the least afraid,' I answered, my
teeth chattering and my hands trembling, "not
the least, Soldier."
Rufus turned his head and looked at me as if
he had heard a stranger's voice, and then, wagging his tail to reassure me, returned to a dead
point. The sounds became louder and the surging wave rolled nearer.
One who has never beheld a raging sea of
black faces filled with excitement and fury, wild,
ignorant, brutal, some distorted with intoxication, cannot form the faintest idea of the awful
sight. They threatened vengeance against my
Soldier, saying that, not satisfied with fighting
against their liberties, he was now trying tokeep away those who would befriend them.
'They were led by a renegade white man whi,
when they reached a point where possible
danger lay, retired from leadership and withdrew to a protected spot in the rear.
My Soldier stepped out on the porch and econ-
fronted the mob, who were yelling, cursing, and
brandishing pistols, knives, and all manner of
weapons. Looking at them for a few seconds
he said:
"Boys, what does all this mean? What is all
this trouble about? You don't know what you
are doing. That cowardly dog there, sneaking
and crouching down behind you to save his own
worthless carcass, is not your friend. For a
few handfuls of money he will lead you to steal,
lie and kill. All he wants is what he can make
out of you. Don't trust him, boys. These miserable Yankee scalawags haven't any love for
you. They never owned any negroes. We who
owned you are your friends. We have been
brought up together and understand each
other."
"Dat's so, niggers; dat's so," cried Uncle Tom,
who had come up with the mob as if he were one
of them in spirit. "You better listen to Marse
George. He sho' is tellin' you de trufe, niggers—de gorspel trufe."
"Stand back! Stand back!" cried my Soldier,suddenly starting forth and waving both hands.
"Stand back, I say!"
The negroes fell back on both sides and my
Soldier went down between them to where the
white renegade was cowering behind his poor,
ignorant, impulsive black dupes, and, seizing
him by the collar, shook him with all his force.
The collar broke and the man fell to the ground.
My Soldier jumped on top of him and called,
"Bring me that rope!" pointing to the clothesline stretched across the road. "Come, boys,
let's tie the scoundrel !"
After they had securely bound him the General ordered some of them to pick him up and
carry him to the smokehouse and lock him in,
which they did with great satisfaction, their
mercurial natures having now veered completely
to the side of my Soldier.
"Now, boys," said he, "get into your boats and
zo back home, and be thankful that the bad man
locked up there in the haunted smokehouse with
the rats and ghosts has not made you all commit a crime, too, for which you would be sent
to jail."
The reference to the spectral inhabitants of
the smokehouse was, for the colored people, a
sufficient bar to their possible change of sentiment and return to the rescue of their former
leader. They believed implicitly in the un-canny reputation of that house and, to their
view, the ghost of old Grundy, who had hanged
himself from its rafters and who, as the story
goes, when the flames were devouring the old
colonial home within a stone's throw of it, came
out shaking his fist at them, thus saving the
smokehouse from the fire, was more formidable
than the armies of the whole world. The next
morning the sheriff took the prisoner to Richmond, where he was jailed and promptly
brought to trial. He was found guilty of inciting a riot and was sent out of the country.
Uncle Tom was an old servitor of the Pickett
family. He had been at Turkey Island when
the mansion was burned and had contrived to
save a few relics from the ruins. Among them
was a medallion which had been presented to
my Soldier's grandfather by La Fayette. It
was set in gold, framed in blue velvet, and hung
in the library under La Fayette's picture. As
one of Butler's men was carrying it to the
steamer the medallion fell out, and Uncle Tom
picked it up and had saved it all these years.
In his own logical way he explained the selection
of the one to whom it should be given.
"T done studied 'bout dis 'heritance a heap, en
I says to myse'f, 'Well, I gwine to give dis 'herit-
ance to Miss Sally, kase she Marse George's wife
en Marse George he is de oldest chile.' Den
1 says, 'No, dat ain't ret; I gwine to give it to

From the rim of gold around this "'heri-
tance," as Uncle Tom called it, my Soldier had
made two pairs of beautifully carved bracelets,
one for his brother's wife and one for his sister.
The miniature was made into a pin for me,
which I still have and wear, not only for its
quaint prettiness and because it 1s almost the
only relic of all those old household treasures,
but in memory as well of Uncle Tom and of La
Fayette's appreciation of the hospitality of old
Turkey Island."aop's *TISEMENT"
PON leaving Canada we had expected to
lose Annie, our faithful nurse, but she
interrupted our objections to taking her
with:
"Tlowly Fathers! an' sure an' phwat's to become of me widout the baby an' leastwise,
phwat's as bad an' worse, phwat's to become of
the baby widont me?"
We explained that wages were much higher
in the States and that we could not afford to
take her. She begged to be allowed to come
at any sacrifice of her own interests, so we
finally consented, resolving that she should lose
nothing by her lovalty.
Annie enjoyed the journey and the visit to
New York, but at Norfolk the hundreds of negro
stevedores who met the New York steamers
frightened her nearly to death. The few colored people whom she had seen in Montreal and
looked upon as martyrs and saints were of a
very different class from these. When I tried
to reassure her she said angrily:
"Oh, the mother of ye that ye are, sure—being afther planning to have one of these black,
howling, writhing craythurs nursing of the boy,
the dirty, twisting bastes! It's meself that's
afther the temptin' of Providence to be a risking of me own grown-up life among such hay-
thens, a singin' words widout any meanin', the
saints save us!"
She was praying and counting her beads.
In my father's home there had been only
colored servants, and my father and brothers,
the most courtly of men, could not bear to see
Annie standing in their presence while they remained seated. She was not only being spoiled
by then numerous courtesies and gallantries,
but was embarrassed by them, feeling herself a
servant equally with the colored maids.
Our second child, little Corbell, was three
years old when Annie left us to marry a well-to-
do farmer, a young man who, in his rural simplicity, recognized no superior. I was sorry
to part from her, particularly on account of
Corbell's strong aversion to colored people.
After innumerable failures to fill her place a
kinswoman, noted for judgment and care in the
selection of her servants, sent me her own
nurse until I could secure one that would pleaseme. The nurse remained three days, when Cor-
bell took the situation into his own hands and
thus explained it in his prayers:
"Our Father who art in Heaven, please send
me a white nurse because nobody else can, and
because when black hands touch me my soul
crawls all around inside and I get icicles and
ereepy things all down my back, and, oh, dear
Lord, our Father who art in Heaven, I'd rather
have no supper than have their black hands cut
it up for me, and I'd rather be dirty as the pigs
than have them wash me, and I'd rather not go
out doors and see the birds and flowers and
other children and things play and pick the
buttereups that the policeman don't care if we
piek because they grow wild, than have their big
black-white eyes watching me. So, our Father
who art in Heaven, please send me a white
nurse quick, for Christ's sake. Amen!"
"Don't you know, my darling," I said, "that
all the Southern children have colored nurses.
Your mamma had one and loved her almost like
a mother. God made the colored people."
"Well, then, there must have been a colored
God around somewhere."
He thought that the black God must be very
wicked and prayed that the dusky deity might
die "and let the white God make all the people."
At that time the only servants in Virginiawere colored. Tinding that the child could not
become aceustomed to "black hands" and that
his health was endangered by his efforts to overcome a weakness that seemed congenital, we
advertised for a white nurse but with no suec-
cess. Hearing us talk about advertising, Cor-
bell asked God to put in a "'tisement" for a
white nurse for him. He prayed for everything
he wanted and asked the Lord to do things for
him that his father and mother could not do, at
the same time begging the Father in Heaven
not to let us know that he had appealed to a
higher power, lest our feelings be hurt.
We were staying at the Ballard and Exchange
Hotel in Richmond. One morning as we were
going out for our daily ride a beautiful woman
dressed in deep mourning was standing in the
hall. With a startled expression she held out
her hands and my little Corbell ran into her
arms, exclaiming:
"Oh, you are the dear, good God's 'tisement
and you have come to be my nurse and take my
'Carthy's place. See, our mother, see! Black
hands won't ever, ever make creeps in me anymore, now that our Father who art in Heaven
has sent the 'tisement to me."
The stranger clasped the child to her heart,
kissing his golden curls and sweet brown eyes
while her tears fell."Pardon this uncontrolled emotion, madam,"
she said, 'and excuse me, please, for taking such
a liberty with your child. I have just passed
through a great sorrow and am very nervous."
I led her to our rooms where she sat with my
little darling in her arms, gazing into his face
lovingly and moaning, "My little angel! Oh,
my little angel!" He took out his tiny handkerchief and wiped her eyes and kissing her said:
"Don't cry, "Tisement, don't cry. Come and
ride with our mother and my little brother and
me and you can hold me in your lap; come,
*Tisement, come."
She rode with us, sitting beside me, holding
my little Corbell.
"Why do you call me 'Tisement?" she asked.
Corbell explained that, hearing us talking
about advertising for a nurse and seeing how
we had failed, he had sent an advertisement to
70d himself, asking for just the kind he wanted,
"and," he added, "I knew you were God's 'tise-
ment as soon as I saw you."
When we returned she told me her sad story,
the tragic story of a beautiful, fair, proud woman with the one black drop in her veins. All
her Joved ones were gone, her beautiful boy
the last to leave her, and she longed for little
hands to soothe away her pain. She stayed
with us and her new-found charge saw only thepure white face, the delicate soft hands that
touched him lovingly, and knew nothing of the
dark link that held her in bondage to the past.
She was a devoted nurse, helpful and diplo-
matie with both children, but it was on Corbell
that she showered all her pent up love. He was
very fond of music and was always ready to
greet the dawn with a smile and a song. Harly
one morning when George first opened his eyes
after a night in the better world of dreams, he
heard Corbell's flute-like tones in the strains of
"Where, oh, where are the Hebrew Children?"
The necessity of taking up the tangled threads
anew filled his little heart with dismay, and with
a sense of having been wronged he called out:
Our mother, please come and make Corbell
top singing 'Where are the Hebrew Children?'
don't know where the Hebrew Cluldren are
and I don't want to know."
Mary, the faithful answer to God's "'tise-
ment," volunteered to find the Hebrew Children
and amid her suggestions of possible places in
which they might be concealed, peace was restored.
Corbell was one of the most gifted of children. Not only could he sing, but he was quite
an artist with the scissors, and at a very early
age could cut out the most astonishing representations of birds and animals. One day after
an illness I thought he had been cutting long
enough and suggested to him to put up the scissors lest he become nervous and tired. Click-
elick went the scissors. "Wait till I get the
meat part of the mule's mane right,' he said.
Several times ] made the same suggestion, receiving the same reply, and click-click-click went
the scissors. Then forgetting myself I raised
my voice and commandingly called, "Put those
scissors down, sir, this minute!"
Bang went the scissors across the other side
of the room and with eyes flashing with indignation he cried out:
"Madam!

Our nearest neighbors in the hotel were
Colonel and Mrs. Parsons. The Colonel had
belonged to the Federal Army and after the warhad brought his family to Richmond to live.
His children had some toy soldiers with which
they and my two little boys would fight great
battles, the Confederates and Federals being
permitted to win alternately.
Mr. Davis came in one day when the star of
vietory shone on the Southern side.
"ITurrah, boys," he said. "I am glad I came
to-day. I like to see the Confederates win."
"Wait, wait," said my little George, "and we'll
let you see the Federals win."
"Ah, my little man," replied Mr. Davis in his
pathetie voice, "your father and I have seen
the Federals win."
Corbell was always interested in his father's
fighting in Mexico. Of course Mr. Davis far
outranked my Soldier in that war, but when Cor-
bell asked, "Were you in papa's Company, Mr.
Davis, or was he in yours?" rather than hold
any preeedence over his father in the boy's
thought, Mr. Davis replied:
"If J] remember correctly, we were both in
each other's Company, I think, my son."
"Our mama," said Corbell, after Mr. Davis
had gone, "what has Mr. Davis got in his throat
that makes his talk sound so music-y?"
The summers we passed at the Old Green-
brier White Sulphur and the Salt Sulphur
Springs, the hotels in both places being keptby brothers who had served in my Soldier's
Division.
One season we occupied a cottage with Mr.
Peabody, the great philanthropist. It was his
last visit to his native land, the summer before
he died. He had gone to the Springs in the
vain hope of restored health. Looking for
my little Corbell one day I found him in
the rooms of Mr. Peabody who, with weak and
trembling hands, was signing some cheques.
Corbell was sitting on his knee, watching his
work.
"T know what makes your hand tremble," be
was saying. "Our mother told me; she says it's
because of all the good things it has done for
God's people."
"Your little hand does not tremble. Aren't
you glad?" asked Mr. Peabody.
"V'd rather have trembly hands if they would
help me to do good to all the people like yours,"
replied Corbell.
In the last summer of General Lee's life he
was at the "Old White" taking the waters. Cor-
bell had been ordered to drink them, too, and
emphatically objected.
"Don't drink that water, General Lee,' he
said. "It doesn't smell good."
"But you drink it," replied the General.
"T have to; they make me," responded Cor-bell sadly. "You are a man and they can't make
you."
"But I like it," asserted the General.
Corbell regretfully confided to me afterward:
"They call him a great man, our mama, and,
oh, he likes things that don't smell good."
It was the only cloud upon his confidence in
General Lee.
Coming in one day the General found the children building block houses.
"Ts this the house that Jack built?" he asked.
"No, sir," replied Corbell. "That's the house
that George built and this is the house that Cor-
bell built. Jack didn't build any houses down
this way."
"Don't you know the story?" asked General
Lee. "This is the house that Jack built. This
is the malt that lay in the house that Jack
built! "
"Ves, sir," returned Corbell, "but it makes me
feel weazley to keep on saying the 'Jack built'
part."
In passing out of the dining-room one evening General Lee stopped at our table by the
door. We were cracking nuts, which reminded
him of the story I had told about the young
man who asked for "the nut-busters." He said
to Corbell:
"Your little hands are not strong enough touse these 'nut-busters.' Let me crack your nuts
for you."
"No, thank you, General," replied the child.
"Our mama says that we may eat all we can
erack and that the squirrels don't have anybody
to erack their nuts; if they did they'd eat too
many, too. 'Course she don't want to hurt our
hands, but she is afraid if somebody cracks nuts
for us we'll eat too many and be sick."
The General said if that was the case he
would not offer to erack any more nuts for
little children.
J have a tender memory of a call from General Lee once when my little Corbell was very
ill at the Ballard and Exchange. One morning
Uncle Wash, the old colored porter, tiptoed in
with a card,
"It's Marse Genul Lee, Missus," he whispered.
"He come ter ax atter de li'le man, en he say he
moughty sorry to hyer boutn his being so bad
off. He's ret out hyer at de do'."
I went to the door and held out my hand to
General Lee.
"T have heard of the illness of my little friend
and have come to see him."
My Soldier got up from the side of the bed
and brought a chair.
"I have come to renew my acquaintance,
George, with our little man here," he said, eall-ing my Soldier by his name, which ] had never
before heard him do.
Fle was President at that time of Washington
College, now the Washington-Lee University, at
Lexington, and this was the last time he was
ever in Richmond.
General Lee's fondness for children made him
always a great favorite with them, and he and
our little Corbell discussed the Old White, its
nasty smelling sulphur-water, and the many
friends they had made there. Uolding up his
little thin hand, Corbell said:
"See, General, how wobbly my hand is. It's
a heap trembher than Mr. Peabody's was. 1
can write my name now, but I can't write it to
do good with and to give things, as Mr. Peabody
did; I wish I could. My, wouldn't I make it
fly?"
"Your dear little hand does more good than
it could possibly do by writing your name on
paper," replied General Lee. "It is a hand of
love and that is better than anything else in the
world. I saw Dr. Minnegerode and he told me
how sick you had been and how patient and
sweet you were and how hard you were trying
to get well."
"Dr. Minnegerode wasn't a soldier like you
and our papa, was he?" asked our little darling,
shaking his head and changing the subject."Yes," replied General Lee, "but he did not
fight with a sword. He is a preacher, a Bible
teacher, and fights with the spirit."
"That's poetry, isn't it?" asked Corbell.
"Yes; that is poetry."
"General, Dr. Minnegerode always says his
prayers with me and asks the Lord to bless me
and make me well," said Corbell.
"May I say my prayers with you, too, my boy,
and ask the Lord to make us both well and bless
us?"
"Yes, General, but you are a soldier, not a
preacher."
"No, I am neither now, my little man," replied the General; "just a poor, sick, helpless
child like you, asking for health."
We knelt by the bedside and prayed the most
beautiful prayer I ever heard.
It was the last time I saw General Lee.bis: DOVE od

Though living a life of deep earnestness, my
Soldier was fond of a story or a jest. He used
to tell some of Lincoln's jokes and anecdotes
which, in his youthful days in Illinois, he had
heard from the lips of that famous story-teller,
so that when I afterward saw the stories of the
great War President in print I remembered
many of them as old friends. Mr. Lincoln was
much interested in the plantation legends told
by the Virginia boy and they exchanged stories,
to the delight of both.
My Soldier especially liked a joke if it was
upon me. On leaving home for a business trip
he once asked me how much money I should
need before his return. After a labored caleu-
lation I mentioned a sum which he, knowing me,
promptly doubled. He had been gone only a
day when I suddenly recalled an obligation that
had eseaped my memory, and telegraphed him.
By next mail came a cheque, carefully made out,
payable to "Mrs. Oliver Twist." As I must
have the money it was necessary for me to
indorse it as it was made out. To tease
me he kept the eheque to dangle before my
eves on the slightest provoeation, and I have
it now.
Ie always made companions of our boys and
joked and plaved with them as if he were the
same age as they. One morning when our little
George was about ten years old he took him to
the offiee several blocks from home,sending him
back with a note, telling him to go directly home
and not to get into any trouble on the way.
Then he followed him, watehing his progress.
I still have the note in which were recorded the
little fellow's meanderings, of which this is a
copy:
"Saw a man posting bills; stopped to watch
lim. Went on a short distance; saw two dogs
fighting. Stopped to see which beat; sicked
them on again. Farther along saw something
interesting in a drug-store window; stood andlooked. Started on and came to some boys playing marbles; stopped and took a hand in the
game; lost all his own marbles, paid up like a
man, walked on, whistling. Came to a man
shoveling coal; helped him, and pocketed some
sinall pieces. Met aman he knew; stopped and
talked to him, asked the time. Played in a pile
of sand with a stick. Had a fight with Wirt
Robinson; licked each other. Found a boy who
had lost a penny down a crack; helped him to
vet it out. Saw a kitten escaping from a cellar
window; chased it back. Met a boy on stilts;
made him get down and let him walk on them.
Saw an old woman coming out of the doorway
with a bueket of water on her head; jumped at
her, frightening her, making her head lose its
balance, spilling the water all over her. Turned
his pockets inside out and gave the old woman
all his week's allowanee, as compensation for
the wetting he had caused. Reached the gate;
stopped to play with the latch. Wentin. Time
in reaching home, one hour and twenty-five minutes."
The report was sent by a messenger, who delivered it to me before little George came into
the house, so that, to his great surprise, I was
able to tell him all that he had been doing.
When I showed him the record he said:
"T knew dear father was a great man andknew most everything, but I didn't know he had
God's eyes and could see everything."
To my query whether he had done anything
else by the way which his dear father bad not
seen, he replied:
"Yes; I threw Branch Barksdale's hat over
the fenee, and I wouldn't have been home yet if
he hadn't chased me."
Charlotte Cushman was with me at the time
and I had an amusing illustration of the way in
which she unconsciously threw herself into a
situation.
"Poor little man! Poor little man!" she said
in her deep sympathetic voice, as she observed
the bewilderment of the child, expressed in
every line of his tense little body, his puckered
features and bent fingers. "His little brain is
all puekered up, too. He can't understand how
this thing should have come to hun. Poor little
nan! It is wieked to mystify him so—bless his
little heart!"
In her sympathy she had assumed the pose of
the bewildered child, and her faee and hands
were "puckered up," as she had described his
brain.
This was Miss Cushman's last visit to Richmond, when she came as a reader, having left
the dramatic stage. When I first knew her she
was at the height of her wonderful career asMOST EVERYTHING, BUT 1 DIDN'T KNOW HE

oT me at edi wong ey Jan actress. I met her at the house of a friend,
and she often visited me when in Richmond.
She became very fond of our children and they
were fascinated by her. My little Corbell asked
her:
"What is the use of acting? Why don't you
be it—just be it?"
"Ah," she replied, "there is the trouble. I do
'be it, my child. There is where strength and
vitality go—in just being it."
Corbell was anxious to see her play, but she
would not let him see her as Meg Merrilies.
"No Meg Merrilies must ever come into the
life of a child like that," she said. "Of all the
people I have ever known, he would be the most
deeply impressed by Meg Merrilies."
.\ friend had sent in some birds for Corbell,
and he said to Miss Cushman:
"T wasn't brought up thinking it any wrong
to shoot birds or any wrong to eat birds, and
all the good people I know shoot them and eat
them. But things that have such pretty
feathers and such pretty talk in their throats
must have souls, and so I don't know for sure
about shooting them and eating them, not for
really, truly sure, you know."
"T think you are right, my child, about the
birds having souls, and IT believe horses and
dogs have souls, too. You know, dear, I believein reincarnation. We eat the body of the bird,
the feathers we put in our cap, and the soul is
the voice that must sing in another bird."
After that Corbell did not feel so bad about
the shooting of the birds. "The soul goes out
and another bird catches it and sings."
Charlotte Cushman told me how her idea of
Meg Merrilies had come to her. On the evening
of the day that she had been unexpectedly called
upon to play the eharaeter she was standing
in the wing awaiting her cue, book m hand, when
she heard one of the gypsies say, "\leg—why,
she is no longer what she was; she doats." Ina flash there came to her the conception of the
character in which she was to make her greatest
suceess.
T never saw her Lady Macbeth on the stage,
but retain a vivid impression of the awesome
personation when she showed me in my own
room how she had played the sleep-walking
scene upon her first appearance in drama when
she was nineteen. I still see her tragic face
with the dawning horror creeping over it as
she looked at the stain on her hand. With the
sudden impulse of a frightened woman, she
hurriedly took up a fold of her dress to rub
it off. The futility of the effort flashing upon
her, she removed her clutch from her dress and
a deeper terror gloomed into her face. Shewe
ww

wee
caught up her long hanging hair and tried to
rub away the stain. With her great awecompelling eyes fixed upon her hand she uttered
the words, "Out, damned spot!" in a tone of
anguished despair that thrilled me with terror.
She did not act Lady Maebeth; she ieas Lady
Maebeth in all her pride, all her ambition, all
her determination, all her despair. She said
that she did not like to play the character because it exhausted her. It is easy to understand that a woman of cold and unserupulous
ambition would drain the life of one so gentle
and sweet-natured as Charlotte Cushman.
In this engagement she did not play Nancy
Sikes, but she gave us her characterization of
the part because my Soldier wanted to see it.
Lawrence Barrett described it accurately when
he said: "It sounded as if she spoke through
blood." She was one of the few to whom a set
stage with scenery and music and costumes and
an audience are not necessary in the production
of artistic effects. A private room, or a grassy
plot under a tree, or an open space in the sunshine, was all the stage she required, one soul
that understood her was audience enough, and
when she threw herself into the character she
represented no one would have known whether
she wore the garb of a beggar or a queen.
I told her of having met Ellen Tree in Canada."Oh," she said, "that was worth losing your
name for," referring to the fact that in Canada
the General and I were known by our middle
name of Edwards. "The very fact that she
could not keep from acting when off the stage
made her interesting. Did you ever see her
wipe her nose?"
J never had, so, to illustrate Ellen Tree's manner of performing that ceremony, Miss Cush-
man slowly and mysteriously drew her handkerchief from her pocket. As she did so her eyes
opened wide and glared ominously, as if some
scene of tragic import were looming up in the
middle distance. Her form was tense and rigid,
all her museles drawn taut as if for a fatal
spring. The handkerchief was lifted and applied
to each nostril, while the face was stern and uncompromising as might have been that of the noble Roman sentencing his son to death for breaking the law. 'The handkerchief was returned to
her pocket in the same dramatic manner.
"The blood of all the Caesars was on that
handkerchief when it was put away," Charlotte
said, "Hllen Tree could not help acting; it washer nature."
Killen Tree's everyday tragedy was sometimes
productive of startling results. Going into
Price's dry-goods store in Richmond she asked
in her most dramatic voice:"Have ye any prints?"
"N-n-no, no, dear Madam," stamimered the
gallant but startled Virginian, "I-—D'm sorry."
One of the clerks came to his assistance with
the information that the lady meant calicoes, at
the same time taking down some pieces from the
shelf. The customer examined them with
tragic significance and looked up with eyes filled
with fathomless depths of emotion, inquiring
in a voice of intense power, dwelling with
dramatie force upon each word:
"Said ye they would wash?"
"N-n-no, Ma'am," replied the terrified clerk,
"TY d-d-did not, Ma'am."
Charlotte Cushman's manner was the opposite
of that of Ellen Tree. She was a perfect child
of Nature, and one meeting her would have
supposed that she was a gentle, quiet home-
keeper with no thought except to please her own.
Speaking of Joe Jefferson she said:
"T think his paintings are as marvelous as his
acting, and the colors in his voice blend as perfectly as those in his paintings. He really must
have had a dog named Schneider when he was
playing Rip Van Winkle, and if you had told
him differently he would not have believed you.
He could fool himself into thinking that whatever he acted was a fact, and his audience readily took the same view."Onee when Charlotte Cushman was with us
Judge Moneure, then an old man, came in and,
meeting his wife, greeted her with great chivalry, bending and kissing her hand. Judge
Joynes, of Petersburg, asked, "How old is Mrs.
Moneure, Judge?" Judge Moneure replied,
"She was sixteen when I married her, Judge,
and to me she has been that age ever since."
The little incident reminded Charlotte of the
Brownings, whom she had known in Florence,
and of the beautiful eompliments that Robert
Browning used to pay his wife. She spoke of
his indignation when Mrs. Browning's poetry
was compared with his own in a manner unfavorable to her. He really felt that she was
superior to himself and had no patience with
people who could not appreciate her greater
meri
She was fond of dialects, saying, "Everything
is more fascinating than plain English." In
Ireland she talked the brogue with the peasants
so well that she might have passed for one of
them. She was equally at home with Seoteh,
German and Italian dialects, and when in the
North had been noted for recitations in negro
speech, which she thought the most beautifulwe

aw
of all. But on coming to Richmond she found
that she did not know anything about the lingo
of the darkies. Being anxious to learn it, she
used to talk with old Wash and Julia, two his-
torieal characters at the Ballard and Exchange
Motel, repeating their expressions over and
over. Later she would try to say them, finding
that she was no more expert than in the beginning. Thus she learned that to know plantation
talk one must be born to it; it eannot be
acquired.
She was at that time victim to a painful and
wasting disease. Seeing her suffering one day
from the treatment for the malady, I said:
"Oh, lamsosorry! You can't play to-night."
"Yes, my dear," she replied gently, "I shall
play to-night, and, it may be, all the better for
the pain."
Watching her wonderful performance that
evening I thought it might be that pain is the
gateway to the highest realm of art.
The last time I saw Charlotte Cushman was
in Philadelphia. A great sorrow had shrouded
me from the sunlight, and she tried to shelter
me in the warmth of her own heart.
"You ought to have been an actress," she said,
"and then you would have regained happiness
by simulating it."
Another of our friends from the mimic world
was Joe Jefferson, whom we saw now for the
first time since meeting him in Canada. On
eoming to Richmond he found that his old
friend, Mr. Caskie, who had helped him to a foothold upon life, had lost his fortune by the war,
and was in even greater need than the unknown
boy had formerly been. The famous comedian
was not one to forget a kindness. '"Let's give
him a benefit,' he said to my Soldier. IJt was
characteristic of Joe Jefferson that he never
said "I will do" thus and so. He said ''Let's do
it,' as if the suecess of the project depended
upon the one to whom he was talking rather
than on his own ability. The benefit was given
and the man of ruined fortunes had reason to
be glad that in the days of the full larder he
had "east his bread upon the waters."HE old Ballard and Exchange Hotel in
Richmond, Virginia, celebrated for having entertained more distinguished visitors than any other hostelry in this country,
consisted of two houses on opposite sides of the
street, connected by one of the most picturesque
bridges, where the guests found a pleasant
meeting place as they passed from one building
to the other.
Colonel Carrington, the proprietor, was a
courtly, gallant and hospitable old Virginia
gentleman, a peer of peers, yielding to no
superiority of position, as was evidenced in his
reception of the Prince of Wales on his visit to
Richmond. After cordially shaking hands with
the royal visitor he slapped him on the back
and said:
"Make yourself at home, Prince, make yourself at home, sir. I extend to you my heartiest
welcome, sir. Old Wash will look after you
and if I can be of any service, Prince, just call
on me."
I never heard whether the Prince returned
the Colonel's slap but T know that he accepted
the cordiality in the same spirit in which it was
offered. We visited the Colonel's stables and
discussed the pedigree of his fine thoroughbred,
dreve with him behind his fastest trotter, and
so liked the old Virginia mint juleps which he
drank with his host, that he asked for and received the recipe for making them and took it
back with him to the motherland, with some
mint roots to plant in his palace garden.
The Colonel was our life-long friend and devoted to our children who, while they returned
his affeetion, stood in awe of him from the
time that he gave them a graphic illustration,
by pulling his wig awry and turning his eye-
hds wrong side out, of what had happened to
"peeping, prying, inquisitive Jerry."
On our return from Salt Sulphur Springs the
summer our little Corbell was in his eighth vear,
as we drove up to the Exchange Hotel the dear
old Colonel came out to the carriage and said:
"Your rooms are all ready, General. We received your telegram and prepared for your
coming, but we have two eases of measles here,
so I have arranged to have you taken eare of at
the Monumental Hotel till the danger is over."We thought it best not to run any risk, and
went to the Monumental. The rooms were large
and comfortable. Dr. and Mrs. Barksdale were
the first to greet us. They, too, with several
others of our friends who had little children,
had been obliged to leave the Exchange for the
same reason,
Our precautions proved in vain, for my sister,
a young lady just entering society, who was
staving with us, was stricken with the disease,
and my schoolboy brother and my two children
eaught the contagion. At the end of three
months, however, all were well exeept our beautiful, gifted, wonderful boy, our little Corbell,
always a delicate child, who now became weaker
day by day.
There was never anything like the goodness
of the people of Richmond in those trying
months. Relatives, friends and strangers came
daily with toys, hooks, good things, carriages, as
long as we could take our darling to ride, for
his beautiful angel face, his wonderful mind and
his glorious voice had won a place in every heart.
While Corbell was ill Mr. Davis called on us
for the last time, as he was never again in Richmond. When he came in I drew up a chair for
him, but he said:
"May I not sit on the bed beside our sick
boy ?"When Corbell's lunch was brought in he asked
that luncheon be brought for Mr. Davis, to which
Mr. Davis added his voice.
"Shall I say grace, Mr. Davis, or will you?'
asked the child,
"You, if you please,' Mr. Davis rephed, "for
I should like to hear your grace."
Closing his beautiful eyes Corbell said the
grace his father had taught him:
,
'Dear Jesus, be our Guest to-day,'
adding, "and never mind, Jesus, about Mr.
Davis being here for he would like to have
you,"
I do not think that the child took his eyes from
Mr. Davis's face, except to say grace, during the
whole time the visitor was there. Oh, but that
face was so awfully, so pathetically changed!
Kvery expression, the sound of his voice, the
look in his eyes, all betokened a broken heart.
Only the harmony of motion and the melody of
tone remained,
On Good Friday night, seven months afterward, in sorrowful tones one and then another
of my friends as they left me for the night whispered resignation to the will of God. Our Cor-
hell was dying. All through the long weary
night my Soldier, Mary and I breathlesslywatched and listened beside him. As we were
moving softly about the room he said:
"Pm not asleep, our mama. 'Tisement
thought I was dreaming 'cause I was laughing,
but I wasn't. I was laughing about the
funny thoughts I had when I was young.
I just couldn't make my eyes open wide
and when she caught me laughing I could seethe first time I found out that God was ahead.
It was that time in the bathroom when I wanted
you to turn on the snow and 'Tisement said you
couldn't do it, and couldn't any of you do it;
neither our mama nor our papa nor Thomas
could turn on the snow. You said you could all
of you turn on the water. Well, I couldn't see
why you couldn't just as well turn on the snow
aus the water. Then all of a sudden the thought
came into my head that God was ahead of you
all and that only He could turn on the flaky,
flying, zig-zag snow, and I began wondering
what more He could do that nobody else, not
even our mama and our papa, could do. Do you
remember how Thomas laughed at me the next
day when I told him about it? How funny I
was when I was young, wasn't I? I reckon all
the little children are just as funny, though,
and all of them think there isn't anything in
the world that their father and mother can't
do. I know I thought so until that very morn-ing and then I knew that God was ahead even
of them. Once I asked our papa which was the
oldest, he or God, and oh, my, but I was so hurt
and disappointed when he said God was the oldest."
Little streaks of light were just beginning to
scramble in through the slatted blinds. My
Soldier smiling, stooped and kissed our darling's
little wasted hands and said, "Yes, my boy; God
is ahead," and then he walked over to the double
windows and opened wide the blinds so that all
the dawn-colors might stream in untrammeled
and light the room, that our little one could seethe eastern sky and watch for the sun he loved
so well. The sky beeame a deeper red and moving across it was a black specky cloud.
"What are those dark specks, Soldier; are
they erows?" I asked as I walked through the
window onto the veranda to take a better look
at the long queer line and to breathe in the
morning alr.
"No, little one," replied my Soldier, "they are
wild geese; the cold weather is all gone."
"Then summer has come, our papa," said the
child. "I was watching those little moving
black flakes, too, when our mama asked you
what they were."
A wrangling of voices from below grated
upon our ears.
"Some unfortunate fellow has been overcome
and is in the hands of the police," explained my
Soldier.
The sacredness of our watch, the loneliness
of the hour and the hollow silence of the deserted streets made the harsh voices seem more
discordant. I looked over the rail.
"Oh, what a pitiable sight!" I exclaimed.
"The poor man looks like a gentleman, too, refined and distinguished looking. Poor fellow!
He seems so angry and—so sick. Please, my
darling, go to his reseue. Who knows but perhaps somewhere there are belonging to him little ones like ours?"
"Yes, please go, our papa, please, sir," echoed
the pleading tones from the bed, "go and bring
himin. He may have little ones of our kind and
maybe he has a little one of our mama's kind,
too, waiting for him somewhere."
My Soldier went out just as the round red
rim of the sun burst into sight out of the east.
There was a greater joy than a smile on hus face
when he came back. He had brought the
stranger in and registered him in the hotel as
our guest. Our lives frequently came in touch
with this stranger's in the years that followed,
and he told me that often and again when he
was attacked by that same terrible, almost incurable, malady, the memory of the spirit of thechild in the dawn of Good Friday had saved
him.
A year later, when my Soldier went home and
little Corbell was placed beside him, the children of this man came to me and said, "We are
sorry Corbell is taken away, for we have been
putting flowers on his grave every day, as our
papa told us. But we can just as well put them
here and on the General's grave, too."
The long Saturday passed and Easter Sunday came over the hills in the whiteness of its
lilies and with melodious chimes rang out the
blessed tidings that a Saviour had risen to
bring Heaven to the world. But the golden
light brought no dawn of hope to the hearts of
those who watched sorrowfully over the little
life that was drifting out upon that sea of glorious music into the Heaven of which it gave glad
promise. Lulled to rest while the children sang
their Easter carols, our boy went to join his
brother angels. Through the open window the
voices were sounding "Christ is risen" as he
turned his head and laid his face against mine
and reached out his little hand to my Soldier
and Mary. I felt his spirit flutter and go. With
a shivering sigh for me his soul slipped through
the gate that Christ had risen to unlock.
During his long illness thoughtful friends
from everywhere had been untiring in kindness.All their gifts he had willed to the poor children.
His books he had left to his little brother, his
ving to Mary, his "Confederate Orphan" fund
to his father and me, saying, "Next quarter you
will both be Confederate Orphans, for I shall
be with the soldiers in the Lord's Army—maybe
Vil be His little drummer boy, so I want you
both to have that money."
His "Uncle Bev," as he called Judge Beverly
Tucker, had given him a little enameled democratic rooster and on the Saturday evening before the Easter dawn he asked his father to
give the rooster to the "poor handsome man who
had come in the early morning when the sun
was biggest and reddest and Good Friday was
getting out of the way for Easter."
Weeks before he had selected his pall-bearers
from among his little playfellows and had asked
them all to wear white. To Dr. Minnegerode
he said:
"Please, sir, Doctor, don't make the boys or
any of my friends or relations cry but, please,
sir, tell them something pretty, as you do at
Sunday-school sometimes, and make them as
happy as you can and have them all sing bright
songs; and I want everybody to bring me red
and blue and yellow and pink flowers, as well as
white ones, and when you all get through and
start back home I want the boys and girls toearry all the flowers with them because the
flowers would be so lonesome out there that
they'd fade and die. Birds don't care for
flowers and children do." He often asked me,
"Don't you think flowers can feel?"

re left him under the shade of the young
green leaves, among the blooming flowers of
the early spring, where the music of the waters
of the winding stream as it rippled over the
pebbles could be heard mingling with the sweet
song of the birds.
The morning that he went to sleep George had
come in with a waiter of white cape jasmine
from General and Mrs. Maury, who had taken
him to their home during these last days of his
little brother's perfect life. Tn his loving haste
to bring them to his brother some of the deli-
'ate white blossoms had fallen and been crushed.
Corbell looked down at the hurt leaves, then up
into George's eyes, saving, "Little brother, heTHEY DIE SO SOON"

Diy) ,gentle with the flowers; they die so soon."
These, almost his last words, my Soldier had
engraved on one side of the gold dollar, the
"Confederate Orphan" money which he had
willed to us, and wore it always on his watch-
chain. After he went to our boy I wore it and
always have tried to obey its voice and "he
gentle with the flowers, they die so soon."
My Soldier longed to take me away at once
from the scenes where so much suffering had
come to me and the next morning I summoned
all my strength for the trial awaiting me. I
went to Mary's room and found her dressed,
with the exception of her gloves, ready to go
out. Her trunks, marked and strapped, were
being taken down-stairs. Upon the bed were
my dress and wrap, bonnet and veil and gloves
of mourning, all laid out by her eareful hand.
"Come," she said, "let me help you off with
your wrapper. You have not much time; I was
just coming for you. You are to leave on the
ten-thirty train. George has gone with his
father while he makes the final arrangements.
T have said good-bye to them."
"Good-bye? Mary!" I said. "Good-bye?
What do you mean? You would never leave me
now when I need you so?"
Her beautiful face was as white as marble as
she said:"Weeks ago, my lady, when I saw that our
little darling could not live I made all my arrangements to take the veil. God has again
taken from me all I had on earth. When you,
too, like me, are bereft of everything come tome."
"Passengers for the New York express, time'sup!' rang through the hall.
For one minute we were clasped in each
other's arms; her cold lips pressed mine for the
first time. No word was spoken—she was gone
I was alone. I looked about me, dazed, eon-
fused. There was my hand satchel packed, a
book and a letter, Marvy's writing, on the bureau.
Mechanically I picked them up, shuddering as
I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
Was that pale, pinched face shrouded in crépe
mine?
"Dear Mother, where are you?" George's
little arms were clasping my knees. "Dear
Father sent me to take care of you till he
comes back. He says he will be up in a minute
for you and J must help you to get ready."
Always before our precious boy had called
me "Our Mama" and his father "Our Papa," as
he had been taught by his father. I sat down,
taking him in my lap.
"Our Mama' is ready, my precious boy," I
said."Dear Mother, you've got me and Dear
Father; don't cry—please, Dear Mother. I saw
Mammy-Mary again but she shook her head at
us and pointed up here to you and so Dear
Father wouldn't stop her. Oh, she looked most
as dead as you do, Dear Mother."
"Why do you call me differently, dear?" I
asked,
"Tt don't know," he replied, "but the words
'Dear Mother' just came to me and choked up
in my throat and so I said them out."
From that time to him I was always "Dear
Mother."
From the walls of a convent in France for
many years came at Easter time a message of
love, a book, an embroidered flower, a letter or
a prayer. Then, when all had been taken from
me and I needed her most, only silence came,
and I knew that she, too, had passed beyond.-

"Little one," he said to me, "you must go onto the Springs with our boy and I will join you
just as soon as this business is settled."
"Go without you? Not for the whole world!"
I replied. "No, indeed, my Soldier. I am going
with you. Why, I would not leave you even if
you were perfectly well. I am going with you."
He, with his usual unselfishness, urged my going to the Springs, pleading that he was not at
all seriously il and would be all right in a day
or two.

"I am gomg to Norfolk,' I said, "and that

"But think, little one, think,' he replied.
"You are packed and ready to start, your rooms

White where it is cool and pleasant—please,
now, my Lily, please, dear. This business may
not detain me over a day or two. Be good and

and sweltering; I want to be seorched with heat

ariel 'he ad proved more
complicated than were anticipated and his illness had been aggravated by hard work in the
intense heat. Feeling better the next morning,
he insisted upon going out again, but within the
hour came back with another ehill.
Thus began the long battle with death, in
which no impatient word eseaped his lips. With
the endurance born to the brave, trained in long
marches and agonizing eampaigns and steeled
in the fires of battle, his soul rose triumphant
above the shocks of physical torture. When
intense pain forced a moan from his lips he
would look up pathetically and apologize, saying:
"You must not mind my moaning, little one.
I'm afraid husband is getting into bad habits;
forgive him."
So solicitous was he for me that often he
would not acknowledge that suffering had
eaused an expression of pain, but would say,
"Oh, it was nothing." With serene face he met
the agony, fighting a braver battle than had
ever been waged upon a field of war. Oh, those
dark, dark days when hope failed and faith
waned! If there was one ray of light in their
gloom as I look back through the long weary
years, it was in the loving thoughtfulness and
sympathy of his people, the people of our. beloved land everywhere.
Especially do I recall, among the legion of
those who came to serve, my cousin, William
Jasper Phillips, a mere boy in years but a man
in mind and spirit, who with willing hand and
heart, with gentle words and loyal, loving eyes,
came to watch with me through the dark hours
~~holding my hands with a child's loving fervor
and a man's strong sympathy.
Long years afterward, when I stood by theopen grave of this cousin and looked upon
the many mourners whom special trains had
brought from all parts of the country to do him
honor and show their love, my thoughts went
back to that dread time and I wondered not
'hat a host of friends were saddened by his
_assing.
"n vain were all our prayers—in vain our lov-
eare. The time soon came when I knew
my Soldier's warfare was almost ended.
her Jansen, who had come from Richmond
iv Shim, asked, "Do you want to see me
alone?' With his hand on the Father's knee,
he replied:
"You know, Father, I never was a solitary
bird. J was never alone except sometimes in
the twilight or in the woods and then I had the
spirit of my mother and my little girl with me."
"J know you are reconciled to death," said
the priest. -.
"Ah, no; how could I be? I think God does
not want me to be reconciled to leaving my wife
and little boy alone in the world. He only wants
me to obey with the courage of a soldier who
receives an order that must be carried out because he is a soldier."
The Father was silent for a time as if going
back in memory to an hour long past. Then he
said:"The first time I remember seeing you and
having a talk with you was on Shockoe Hill.
Standing there alone, your little boy gathering
flowers some distance away, you seemed completely lost in the view before you. You held
a bunch of wild flowers in your hand and were
singing, 'As I view now those scenes so charming' I listened and when you had finished
the song you began to whistle. I asked you
what tune you whistled and you said, 'I was
thinking of Forsyth and of the boys and of the
old fellow who came into the camp at San Antonio and acted out "Bennie Havens, O," and we
all gave him money to go on his way and I
sang that song that night, and it came back tome,and Iwondered what had become of the boys.
The next morning at breakfast a young fellow
named May came in and said, "Boys, here is your
money and it is worth it. Iwas Bennie Havens,
O." Twas wondering where May was,' "
On the last day when the physicians wanted
to give my Soldier an anodyne, he said:
"No, I would rather suffer and know. You
say there is no help for me; that I've got to
cross the river. Well, I want to go over in my
right mind—-to know when I'm going; and I
want to see how to steer my little craft as it
pulls out from the shore and Jook into the dear
faces of my loved ones till T breathe my lastgood night. Now, please, Doctor, excuse me,
but won't you all go and leave me alone with
my wife? You have tried to save me for her
and I thank you. Now, all that you can do for
me is to say good night."
Just as they were going my uncle, Colonel
Philips, and his wife came in with our little
boy, who was staying with them.
"Well, Colonel," said my Soldier, "the enemy
is too strong for me again, you see, and, Colonel
~<my ammunition is all out. I am glad you
have both come. Thank you, and now goodnight, my dear friend; you are the last old comrade to whom I shall give an order-—watch over
my wife and child."
Calling our boy he said:
"Crawl up here by 'Dear Father,' my baby,'
and laying his hand on our boy's head he closed
his eyes and there was silence in the room.
Presently he spoke:
"This is the month that God sent you to us,
my boy, and this is the month, I am afraid, that
God is going to call me away from you. You
must take my place at the side of your Dear
Mother, begin at once to be the little husband
to her, the little man for her, and I will watch
over you and help you to perform all these
offices."
"What are officers?" asked the child."Offices. You are old enough to know offices
and officers. You must begin to learn words,
because words are things and their meanings
have much to do with our lives."
He spoke of Indian words and how the Indians had chosen their words.
"Klosch nonnitsh, look out, means you must
not tell anybody; it is a secret. Tum-tum,
heart. Klosch mika tum-tum, my heart speaks
to yours."
He turned to me and said in Chinook:
"T am trying to make him understand the
value of words and feel their meaning as indicated in their sound."
He gave George some money and told him to
treat his little friends, saying that he had found
that it brought him much more pleasure to give
than to receive, and that one of the expressions
of the eyes that he liked more than anything
else was gratitude and love.
"T have seen gratitude and love in a dog's
eyes almost as strong as in a human being's."
Little George asked:
"Tlow about a cat's?"
"Cats have secret eyes. They are eyes of
mystery; eyes that defy you to read them.
They are wonderfully beautiful, and there is a
jewel that looks like them and is called eat's-
eye,"They told Dear Father that he must not
write and he is a good soldier, but he is going
to risk a court-martial and write. Now, run
along and spend your money and have a good
time and remember when even you are having a
good time that it is at nobody's expense."
"What is expense?" asked George.
"You can have it at your own expense."
"What are you going to do to be court-mar-
tialed about?" asked the boy, returning to the
risk that his father was to take.
"Well, I am going to have pencil and paper
if I can get them. J would rather have pen
and ink if I could."
"T will get paper and ink and pen for you,"
replied George.
He went out and returned with paper, a bottle
of ink, a pen and a sponge. He said he tried
to get some shot because he had seen it downstairs to wipe pens on, but he did not see how
it could wipe pens, for he took one and tried
to wipe a pen and couldn't do it.
"Now, this is a love-letter and I don't want
you to read it because you would be jealous. It
is to an old sweetheart," said my Soldier, and
the old twinkle came into his eyes.
On that last day he wrote a letter to Mr. and
Mrs. Haxtun, dear friends at whose home I
had visited in happy days. Mr. Haxtun wasboth Vice-President and Secretary of the Life
Insurance Company which my Soldier represented,
"Sister," he said to the nurse, "I want this
letter mailed at onee."
"Allright," she answered. 'Would I not better ask the Doctor?"
"T want this letter mailed right at onee,"' he
repeated.
{un the letter he had written:
"The marching days are over and when the
train comes in and the call is 'All aboard' and
I shall have started on the last journey, I want
you to come and take my precious wife to your
home and keep her just as long as you can have
her and as she can stay. She loves music, she
loves the beautiful sky, she loves the flowers,
the ocean, and she loves you both. Lying here
thinking about it, T feel that if she went to her
own people they would remind her all the time
of her grief, because it will be a grief to her,
and it would be the same way if she went to
mine. With you there is nothing that will make
the sorrow keener."
When the letter was finished he said to little
George:
"My darling boy, your Dear Mother gave you
my name, George Edwards Pickett. I know
you will take care of it, and now T give you my
place, too, and my darling wife, your Dear
Mother. You understand, my son?"
The little head of his namesake son nestled
closer to his own, the little arms erept about his
neck and the child sobbed out, "Yes, sir, Dear
Father."
"Bless your heart, my baby, bless your heart.
Come now and kiss 'Dear Father,' good night."
After our boy had gone my Soldier said:
"Poor little man! Poor little loving heart!
Ile does not know what death is, even though
he saw his little brother go out of this earth-
life; and you, my darling wife, must not let him
know its meaning now. You must-—you have
got to take my place and be 'Dear Mother' and
'Dear Father," too, to our boy."
The moon was rising, filling the night with
radiance and easting mystie shadows on the
earth.
"Turn down the lights, please, little one,"
he said, "and come to my arms."
Again there was silence. The Doctor came
and gave him something and I have always
thought there was an anodyne in it.
"How beautiful the moonlight looks and how
peaceful! You will remember sometimes, my
darling wife, how often in the years that are
no more, I have sung to you under its silvery
sheen, but my guitar is unstrung and the stringsin my voice are all broken and I can't sing to
you to-night, and I want to—oh, how I want to
sing just one song for, as I hold you close and
feel your touch, I seem to hear again the chimes
ringing out on our wedding day—our blessed
marriage song, 'Believe me, if al] these endearing young charms,' and I hear the choir chanting it soft and low in the distance as the minister is saying, 'Those whom God hath joined
together let no man put asunder,' and the bands
playing the same song as they passed our ear-
riage on the way to the station. I feel the hand
of my wife creep into mine, and as the last faint
sound of the last band dies away I feel our hand-
elasp tighten and hear my own voice singing for
my darling, 'Believe me, if all these endearing
young charms,' and feel the thrill of our great
love."
My Soldier felt my tears. I could not speak.
I could only remember.
"Oh, my Lily—-my little one—my precious
wife! Pass over the dark days as bravely as
you can till our boy is safe and then come to
husband."
His thought went out to the home in which we
had spent so many happy years.
"If I had been at home in our little room
within the sight and the sound of the waters
below us and the old packet-boat coming by, thebirds singing and my own redbird that always
came and the mocking-birds, I think husband
would have been a long time with you and the
little boy. Maybe it is best. I think they must
have given me an anesthetic, though I asked
them not to, for I feel as if floating dizzily. Now,
little one, let's go

woe
Darkness came. Through it some of the
scenes that passed made pictures on my mind
which come back to me now in the dim watches
of memory. I recall the memorials and resolutions of sorrow that came from military asso-
elations, from Boards of Trade, from the many
organizations that had known my Soldier
through the years. From all over the country
they came to tell of the deep appreciation and
honor in which he was held.J remember the long procession of mourners
that followed him through the streets of Richmond to the beautiful resting place of Hollywood, the longest funeral procession, they told
me, that had ever been known in Richmond.
His staff officers, couriers and headquarters
guard met again to follow him as loyally as
when he led them into the whirlwind of battle.
His old soldiers who had Jeaped at the flashing of his sword and dashed with him against
the gates of death, and who were now scattered
through far distant States, had rallied to the
eall of the unblown bugle and the unvoiced command of their beloved leader to mareh behind
him for the last time. Those who had followed
other leaders came to do honor to the memory
of the great soldier who had fought for the
cause dear to them all.
A few years later another procession marehed
down the streets of Richmond to the sacred
ground of Hollywood to attend the dedication
of Gettysburg Monument, erected to the memory of my Soldier and his brave men—the first
Confederate Monument. Again Southern veterans assembled in honor of their leader and of
their gallant comrades. Loyal to them and the
past, they came from many States, faithful as in
the days of fire and storm, bringing their treasure of memories to Jay on that sacred shrine.William Florence and Joe Jefferson placed
their laurel wreaths on the grave of their friend.
From Pennsylvania «ame ex-Governor Curtin,
the war Governor, and two Union Generals,
The Philadelphia Brigade, that stood on Cemetery Hall and received the shock of that great
charge which will live in history while our country stands, marehed in a body to pay tribute
to the great Southern soldier whose heart was
filled with kindness, leaving no room for enmity.
Officers of the old Army of the Forties and
Fifties, who had loved my Soldier in those far-
gone days, three of them members of that
memorable class of 1846, were there, with the
golden flames of old camp-fires yet burning upon
the altar of the heart.
(General Longstreet thus recalls his old comrade:
In memory I can see him, of medium height, of
graceful build, dark, glossy hair, worn almost to his
shoulders in eurly waves, of wondrous pulehritude
and magnetic presence, as he gallantly rode from me
on that memorable third day of July, 1863, saying
in obedience to the imperative order to which I could
only bow assent, ''I will lead my Division forward,
General Longstreet.''
He was the first to scale the parapets of Chapultepec on the 13th of September, 1847, and was the
brave American who unfurled our flag over the castle,cor}

as the enemy's troops retreated, firing at the splendid
Pickett as he floated our victorious colors.
With George E. Pickett, whether fighting under the
Stars and Stripes at Chapultepee or under the Stars
and Bars at Gettysburg, duty was his polar star, and
with him duty was above consequences and, at a crisis,
he would throw them overboard.
In a memorial paper General George B. Me-
Clellan wrote of my Soldier:
