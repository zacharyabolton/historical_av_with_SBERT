Strictest secrecy was enjoined upon us. Only
my father and mother were taken into our con-
fidence. Lucey was bridled, saddled and brought
to the door. I walked with my Soldier, he
holding the bridle, to the upper gate. It was
ten o’clock; the moon was shining brightly and
all was quiet and still.
My Soldier’s plan for me was that I should go
next day to Norfolk, take the steamer to Balti-
more and visit his aunt, whose husband, Colonel
Symington, had been in the old army, and who
had not left it to join the Southern Confederacy,
though his sons had fought on that side, one of
them having been detailed on duty at my Sol-
dier’s headquarters.
“My aunt will welcome you,” he said, “and
you will remain with her until a telegram shall
come to you saying, ‘Edwards is better.”
(Edwards was my Soldier’s middle name.)
That telegram would mean that he was safe
and that I was to join him, starting on the next
train. I was to telegraph to “Edwards” from
Albany, on my way to him, sending my message
to the place at which his telegram had been
dated. If his telegram should say, “There is
still danger of contagion,” I was not to start,
but remain with his aunt until another message
should come.
