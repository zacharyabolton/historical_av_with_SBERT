see the place. Down in old Quincy, Illinois, where
I used to hear George Pickett whistle the songs
of Virginia in his bird-like notes, I have heard
him describe his home till in spirit I have been
here many a time. I have smelled the multi-
flora roses and the Lady Bankshire roses and
the golden cluster roses and those great cabbage
roses, I have seen the borders of hyacinths in
the springtime and the lilies-of-the-valley bloom-
ing in the chimney corner, the beds of violets,
the rows of beehives and the lily-beds that the
bees knew were theirs, had been planted just
for them. I have stood under the arbor and
gathered those strange green looking grapes
that are like the Virginia aristocracy, growing
each one on its own individual stem. I think
he called them scuppernongs. I have sat on
that back porch and listened to the music as his
sister Virginia, of whom he was so proud, sang
in that glorious voice he told me about, and I
have swung in this old swing here while the
moon and I watched and waited for the old eat
to die. So I wanted to see the place.”
I, listening, wondered who he could be, till he
finished and then he said:
“J. am Abraham Lincoln.”
“The President!” I gasped.
“No—no,—just Abraham Lincoln; George
Pickett’s old friend.”
