clothes in a bundle on his head, he said he must
go. I added a few lines to my diary, which I
always kept for my Soldier, and gave it to our
faithful letter-carrier to take back to him.
“Ina da days to come,” said Jaccheri in his
soft Italian voice “ina all lands, no matter,
mucha people, mucha gloly, nadie money, no
matter, you find Jaccheri here—and here—”
first putting his hand over his heart and then
drawing from his boot and gracefully brandish-
ing a shining blade. “Gooda-bye.”
At the door he turned back, untied his cravat,
and wiggled out five pieces of money, three gold
dollars and two ninepences. He walked over
on tiptoe to where the baby was_ sleeping,
erossed himself and, kneeling by the eradle,
slipped into baby’s little closed hand two of the
gold dollars and around his neck a much worn
and soiled seapula.
“Da mon—Confed—noa mucha good, noa now
mucha accountable—you mighta want some;
want her vely bad before you nota get her.
Gooda-bye, some moa.”
Dear, faithful old Jaecheri, he would take no
refusal, so I let baby keep the money. I was
kneeling by the cradle erying and praying for
my Soldier and thanking God that he had so
good a friend as this poor camp postman, when
the door opened softly and Jaccheri looked in.
