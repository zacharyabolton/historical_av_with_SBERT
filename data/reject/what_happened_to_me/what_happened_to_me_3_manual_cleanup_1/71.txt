MONG my childish recollections is an in-
tricate combination of great-grand-
fathers, white mulberries, gold dollars, a
lone eye, guinea eggs, pipes, and bloody mas-
sacres, all centering around a visit from my
own great-grandfather, Dr. John Phillips, and
his friend, Judge John Y. Mason.
“Somebody’s comin’ down de lane en it’s ole
Marser, kase I knows him by his high-top gig
en his star-face critter,” called out a little col-
ored boy, George Washington Cesar Napoleon
Bonaparte, whose keen eyes had caught sight
of an approaching gig. “Dar’s anudder gem-
man alongside of him en anudder li’! boy settin’
in de foots of de gig.”
By the time the visitors were at the gate,
heralded by the barking dogs and the little col-
ored children calling “II-y-e-r comes ole Marser,
h-y-e-r comes ole Marser!” the whole family had
assembled on the veranda to welcome the guests.
