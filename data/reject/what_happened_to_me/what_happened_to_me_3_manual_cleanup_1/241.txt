ment. Baby immediately became quiet in his
arms. Whether it was due to the change or not,
1 do not know, but in a little while he was fast
asleep. I covered him up with the shawl to
which the gentleman pointed, finished eating
my delicious dinner, taking my time and enjoy-
ing it, while he read his book and held my
baby. When the servant came and took away
the tray, I arose and, thanking the stranger for
his kindness, said:
“T will take the baby now, if you please.”
“Tf you would rather,” he said, “yes, but I
think he will be more comfortable with me for
awhile. Then, too, you might waken him if
you moved him. Let me hold him while you
rest. Here is a sweet little book, if you would
like to read it. IJ think, however, it would be
better for you to rest; to sleep, if you could.
You look really fagged out.”
The book he gave me was a child’s book-—it
may have been “Fern Leaves.” J can’t remem-
ber the name, but pasted in the book was a Jetter
written in a child’s irregular hand:
