and bridle, and that he would receive and re-
ceipt for the same every night between the
hours of midnight and daybreak. So suecess-
ful was this impostor that he had almost made
up his load before he was caught, and there
was hardly a bridle and saddle left in all the
surrounding country.
While my Soldier had confidence in Uncle
Tom, he did not much believe that the negroes
would dare make an attack upon him. He in-
sisted, though, that I should not run any risk,
but should take our babies and go to Richmond
for a few days. Finding that no persuasion
could induce me to leave him, he consented
that we might wait together, fearing, yet not
believing, that they would come.
The third night after Uncle Tom’s warning,
when we had begun to hope that he had after
all been misinformed, we heard a rapping at the
door and then a low growl.
“That’s Rufus, rapping on the door with his
tail,” said my Soldier. ‘Ie hears something
and is warning us. Listen!’
He opened the door and the dog entered,
trembling and with great tears of fear in his
loyal eyes. We listened but heard nothing.
My Soldier came in and shut the door.
“Lay the baby down,” he said, “and take this,
but keep it out of sight,” handing me a pistol.
