Y Soldier did not like to fight his battles
over. He said that the memories they
revived were too sacred and sorrowful
for utterance. The faces of the dead and dying
soldiers on the field of battle were never for-
gotten. The sorrow of widows and orphans
shadowed all the glory for him. In the pres-
enee of memory he was silent. The deepest
sorrow, like the greatest joy, is dumb.
“We are both too worn and weary now for
aught else but to rest and comfort each other,”
he said. “We will lock out of our lives every-
thing but its joys. From adversity, defeat and
mourning shall spring calmness for the past,
strength for the present, courage for the future.
Now that, in obedience to the command of Gen-
eral Lee, ] have finished and sent off the report
of the last fight of the old division, the closing
days of our dear lost eause, we will put up
the pen for awhile and lay aside our war
