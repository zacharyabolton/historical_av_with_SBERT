dially as you ean. Put your little hand in his
and forget everything except that he is one of

and really intended to keep my word. I loved
to do everything he bade me. I liked him to
make things hard for me sometimes, that |
might show him how sincere and loving my
obedience was. But when General Ingalls came
on board, was given a salute and received, as
became his rank, with the honors the absence
of which I had marked when my own General

and ran back to my stateroom as fast as I could.
There I burst out erying and shook our baby,
waking him, and told him how his dear father
had been treated—that he had not had any hon-
ors paid him at all, and that a dreadful old bad
Yankee General had come on board and taken
them all, and that when he grew up and was
a big man he must fight and fight and fight, and
never surrender, and never forgive the Yankees;
no, not even if his poor, dethroned father asked
him to do go. J told him how his father had
asked me to shake hands with this Yankee
General, because he was his friend, and that J
was going to do it because his father wanted
me to; that I tried and could not and that he
never must, either—-never, never!
