ILE close of the stormy career of the Con-
ite federacy was marked in blood by the
battle of Five Forks. The end was at
hand.
The Army had subsisted on corn for many
days. As my Soldier was riding to Sailor’s
Creck a woman ran out of a house by the road-
side and handed him a luncheon wrapped in
paper. Passing on, he saw a man lying behind
a log; a deserter, he supposed. What did it
matter? The poor fellows had fought long
enough and hard enough to earn the right to go
home. He spoke to the man, who looked up,
revealing a boyish face. He was thin and pale,
searcely more than a child.
“\re you wounded, my boy?” asked my Sol-
dier.
“No, General, [ am starving, sir,” he replied.
“T eould not keep up any longer and lay down
here to die. I couldn’t help it, Marse George.”
