cliff, a great rounded mass of roek which had
been hurled from its native bed so many cen-
turies ago as to be now covered with a large
forest. Directly in front of the cliff, separated
by a deep gorge, was a low level field partly
covered by a heavy crop of oats which, together
with a natural growth of broom-sedge, afforded
eoncealment to MeClellanâ€™s sharpshooters and
lines of skirmishers. The cliff was defended
by three tiers of field artillery and a heavy in-
fantry support.
