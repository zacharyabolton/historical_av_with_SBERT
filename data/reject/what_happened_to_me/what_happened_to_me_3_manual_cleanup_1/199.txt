George being killed, and you know it, you old
thing! Ill go down and smash his mouth for
him and kick him to death for searing you so, my
poor sister, ’deed | would; but it isn’t so, my
sister. You trust in the Lord. I know brother
George is not killed, for he said he wouldn’t get
killed.”
“No, it is not so. You are right, my darling.
Your brother George is not killed,’ I said.
“Ves, he will come back! he will come back! He
said he would, and he will.”
Thus I spoke and believed, for my Soldier
had never broken a promise. The days came
and the days went and the sun rose each morn-
ing with an auroral glow of hope in its golden
heart. When twilight drifted out from the
forest shadows, the sun went down in a sea of
erimson fire that burned out my dream of hap-
piness. Then night fell and the world and my
heart were wrapped in darkness.
