alighted—my father, always my ideal, tall,
stately, erect as an Indian, seemed to me more
than usually handsome as he lifted me up to
a level with his classic face. His holiday at-
tire, snowy ruffles, rigid stock, black broadcloth
and, above all, the flowers of his brocaded vest,
were to me an inexhaustible source of delight.
My beautiful mother’s coal-black hair, without
wave or crinkle, was carried plainly from her
face and wound in a plaited coil. She was very
fair and her cheeks looked as if they had stolen
two of the pink roses from the garden of May.
Her eyes were like sparkling sapphires. Her
black moire-antique dress had wide bishop
sleeves, and she wore a white crépe shawl that,
falling back, revealed the square of fine em-
broidered white thread cambric around her
neck, crossing in front to form a V.
When all the family carriages had come a
stranger might have wondered if grandmother’s
house could hold the many who claimed her
Yuletide hospitality. We knew that her home
was measured by her heart.
My father, the oldest son-in-law, was the first
to take down his Christmas stocking from
Santa’s rack. He was always sure of a knife,
a black stock and a silk bandanna, whatever else
old Santa might have left for him. His last
year’s knife was then given to the foreman.
