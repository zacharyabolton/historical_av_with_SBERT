saddle-bags in his hand. ‘Going up the road
a piece,’ he called out. It took the man a long
time to go up the road and the boy waited for
him week after week to come down the road.
After a long time there came instead a letter
from which the following is an extract: |
I never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especial-
ly if you have got a bad memory, is the worst enemy
a fellow can have. The fact is, truth is your truest
friend, no matter what the circumstances are. Not-
withstanding this ecopy-book preamble, my boy, I am
inelined to suggest a little prudence on your part.
You see I have a congenital aversion to failure, and
the sudden announcement to your Uncle Andrew of
the suecess of your ‘‘lamp-rubbing’’ might possibly
prevent your passing the severe physical examination
to which you will be subjected in order to enter the
Military Academy. I should like to have a perfect
soldier eredited to dear old Illinois—no broken bones,
sealp wounds, ete. So I think perhaps it might be
wise to hand this letter from me in to your good uncle
through his room-window after he has had a comfort-
able dinner, and watch its effect from the top of the
pigeon-house.
“Tnelosed in this letter was one from Mr. John
G. Stuart, Representative in Congress of the
Third Illinois District, together with an ap-
pointment to West Point.”
