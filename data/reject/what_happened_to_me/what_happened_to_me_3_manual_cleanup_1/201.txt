all good can know! All the privation and
starvation and blood-stains of the past four
years, all the woes and trials, griefs and fears,
of those last dreadful days were swept away
by those blessed, precious’ words, “Whoa,
Luey!” spoken in my husband’s tender tones
to his horse.
I could not wait to go down stairs in the
regular way; it was too slow. So I slid down
the bannisters with my baby in my arms and
ran out upon the porch just as my Soldier came
around the rosebushes that Mr. Lincoln had
deseribed, and which had just budded out. Baby
and | were both in my Soldier’s arms almost
before Lucy had been given into the hands of
the hostler. I do not know how to describe the
peace, the bliss of that moment—it is too deep
and too sacred to be translated into words. I
think that it is akin to the feeling that will come
to me in the hereafter, when I have gone through
all these dark days of privation and of starva-
tion of heart and soul here, victorious, and at
last am safe within the golden gates and, wait-
ing, and listening, shall hear again the voice
that said, “Whoa, Lucy!” here, bidding me wel-
come there as I weleomed him after the perilous
waiting.
