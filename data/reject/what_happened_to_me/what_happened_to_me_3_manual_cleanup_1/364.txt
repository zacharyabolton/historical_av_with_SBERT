ing and then I knew that God was ahead even
of them. Once I asked our papa whieh was the
oldest, he or God, and oh, my, but I was so hurt
and disappointed when he said God was the old-
est.”
Little streaks of light were just beginning to
scramble in through the slatted blinds. My
Soldier smiling, stooped and kissed our darling’s
little wasted hands and said, “Yes, my boy; God
is ahead,” and then he walked over to the double
windows and opened wide the blinds so that all
the dawn-colors might stream in untrammeled
and light the room, that our little one could see
the eastern sky and watch for the sun he loved
so well. The sky beeame a deeper red and mov-
ing across it was a black specky cloud.
“What are those dark specks, Soldier; are
they erows?” I asked as I walked through the
window onto the veranda to take a better look
at the long queer line and to breathe in the
morning alr.
“No, little one,” replied my Soldier, “they are
wild geese; the cold weather is all gone.”
“Then summer has come, our papa,” said the
child. “I was watching those little moving
black flakes, too, when our mama asked you
what they were.”
A wrangling of voices from below grated
upon our ears.
