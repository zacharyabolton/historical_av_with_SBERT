From the rim of gold around this “’heri-
tance,” as Uncle Tom called it, my Soldier had
made two pairs of beautifully carved bracelets,
one for his brother’s wife and one for his sister.
The miniature was made into a pin for me,
which I still have and wear, not only for its
quaint prettiness and because it 1s almost the
only relic of all those old household treasures,
but in memory as well of Uncle Tom and of La
Fayette’s appreciation of the hospitality of old
Turkey Island.
