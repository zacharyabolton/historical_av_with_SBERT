thy husband come as our guests to see our Ham-
let as we have conceived him to be?”
It was the first of Shakespeare’s plays I had
ever seen, and my blood ran cold as I breath-
lessly watched the portrayal of it by these, the
most celebrated actors of their day (Charles
Kean and his wife, Ellen Tree), with talents so
versatile that I cried over the tragedy as if my
heart would break, and laughed with equal
heartiness over “Toodles,” the faree which fol-
lowed.
At the close of the play the actress brought
her husband into the box and introduced him.
Unlike her, he did all his acting on the stage;
she stabbed her potatoes and said, “What! no
b-e-a-n-s ?”
We accepted their kind invitation to share
their carriage back to the house, and enjoyed,
too, some of the delicious supper prepared for
them. It was their last year on the stage, and
I never saw them again, though I treasure their
little keepsake, given me in exchange for one
not half so pretty, and gratefully remember the
pleasure they put into our lives during the days
they were our “Left-handers.”
Among others, there came in time that king
of comedians, noble in mind as he was perfect
in art, Joe Jefferson. This pleasant acquaint-
ance did not end with our Canadian experience.
