won’t-ery mouth-——here is a green chip for a pair
of red shoes.”
General Ingalls put into our baby’s hands his
first greenback, and it was the only money we
had, too—every cent. Baby and I said good-
bye, and he and my Soldier went out on deck.
While I was peeping into the basket “Mr.
George junior” tore the note in two. I caught
the pieces and stuek my bonnet-pin through
them till T could paste them together. One of
the officers brought me some glue, and I eut a
hundred-dollar Confederate note in two to mend
it with. Poor Confederate money!
*Representing nothing in God’s earth now,
And naught in the waters below it;
As the pledge of a nation that passed away,
Keep it, dear friend, and show it.
Show it to those who will lend an ear
To a tale this trifle will tell—
Of Liberty born of a patriot’s dream,
Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.
Too poor to possess the precious ores,
And too much of a stranger to borrow,
We issued to-day our promise to pay,
And hoped to redeem on the morrow.
* These verses were written on the back of a Confederate note,
and for a time were aseribed to John Esten Cooke and to
Colonel Wythe Mumford; afterward attributed to Colonel
Jonas,
