disregarded, he snatched the sleeping baby from
the nurse’s arms, saying:
‘Dis po’ li'l chile can’t he’p itse’f en I gwine
to sabe it anyhow fum bein’ guleched down dat
quicksandy debil’s th’oat, ef de yuthers won't
be sabed.”
Before the last echo had followed the negro’s
words-—before the frightened child could cateh
breath for another shriek—carriage, horses,
driver, footmen, maids, children and mistress
were all sucked in by the dark water. A few
bubbles here and there were the only sign of its
treachery. The horrified riders had followed so
close that the dash of their horses’ feet splashed
the water simultaneously on the screaming child
and over the swirling waves which marked the
fatal spot of its mother’s doom.
As a reward for his warning and for saving
the life of the child, Isaac, the negro, was given
his liberty and a home—the first of his race ever
set free in Virginia~-and was thereafter im-
pressively distinguished by the (to those of his
own color) opprobrious epithet of “Free-Negro-
Isaac.” This name was soon jargoned into
Frenigike, and afterward, through culture and
prosperity, into Freeling, the present family
name of the descendants of Frenigike. The old
place near Sandy Bottom is still called Free-
Nigger-Town.
