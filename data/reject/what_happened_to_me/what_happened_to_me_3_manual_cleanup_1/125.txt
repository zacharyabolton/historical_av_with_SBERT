away while he
| acorner with
my Soldier’s only sister.
In spite of my green olasses I could not help
forming a mental picture of the man who had
been chosen as our political head. He was tall
and extremely slender, but of indescribable dig-
nity and grace. He was a type of the Old
South, cultivated, refined, a brilhant converga-
tionist. lis eyes were clear and of a blue-gray
color. He had a high forehead, straight nose,
thin, compressed lips, pointed chin, prominent
cheek bones, and deep lines around his mouth.
His face was thin, features long and sharp, ex-
pression intense. There was no pomp in his
movements, neither was there anything uncer-
tain. His walk was wonderful; just what a
President’s walk ought to be but seldom is.
When he rode, the beautiful unaffected harmony
and grace of every motion were fascinating.
He pressed my Soldier’s left hand, laying it
gently down on the arm of the chair to avoid
jarring him.
“How soon will you be able to go back?” he
asked. ‘We need you in the field.”
“T should like to go to-morrow,” was the
reply.
