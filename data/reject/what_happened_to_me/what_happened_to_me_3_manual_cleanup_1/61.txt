She and poor Miss Sophia and “Miss Mary”
and several of the neighbors and servants were
standing around that little white casket rest-
ing on a table in the center of the room.
“Is the keepsake in it?” I asked.
My grandmother hfted me up and _ there,
sweetly sleeping, was my little Sara Elizabeth.
I whispered my wish to put the violets into
her lap so that she could see them the first
thing when she awakened and know that [ was
sorry and had brought her both our shares.
My grandmother held me while I gently, and
with no word, lest I should awaken her, put
my violets into her arms so as to “s’prise her
when she waked.” Then I whispered to my
grandmother as she carried me away, “Do
angels want little children for keepsakes?”
