Mr, Davis had not lived through those terrible
four years without making enemies. Who in
such a position could? But when he was made
to suffer for the mistakes of the whole nation,
every Southern heart went out in love to him,
regardless of past antagonisms. All personal
animosities, all political differences were for-
gotten, and the people were united in a loving
sympathy with the toil-worn, feeble, sorrowful
old man, as they never could have been by any
gifts or favors which he might have heaped
upon them had he won not only the object for
which he had given his life, but the gold and
jewels of a kingdom.
A generation later, when the people of the
South met in Richmond to dedicate a monument
to Jefferson Davis, they did not hold first in
their hearts the memory of the statesman, the
orator, the gracious gentleman, the President
of the Confederacy. Above all the pictures that
came thronging before them,as they recalled the
life history of the man in whose honor they
had met, was that scene in the gloomy cell and
that bowed and feeble old man with the wounds
of the irons upon him, in whose sad eyes the
light of love shone as he reached out to greet
a messenger of his own people and said brok-
enly: “My own! One of my own!”
