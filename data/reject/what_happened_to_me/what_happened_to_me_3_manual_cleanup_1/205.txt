been stored at Kent, Payne & Company’s, and
had been burned in the awful fire the night of
the evacuation of Richmond.
The General’s staff had, one by one, come in
during the day from field and camp, and all
breakfasted with us for the last time next morn-
ing in the old Pickett home. I observed that
each wore a blue strip tied like a sash about
the waist. It was the old headquarters flag,
they explained, the flag of Virginia, saved from
surrender and torn into strips by my Soldier
to be kept in remembrance. By our door was
a rose-bush full of white bloom called, because
of its hardihood and early blossoming, the
Frost-Rose. It had been planted by my Sol-
dier’s mother. He broke off some of the buds,
put one in my hair and one in the button-hole
of each of his officers. Then for the first time
tears eame, and the men who had been eloser
than brothers for four long years clasped hands
in silence and parted.
The second social parting was sad, too, for
they had taken me, “the child wife,” into their
lives twenty months before and they all loved
me and called me “Sister.” Their pride in each
other and in their command, the perils that to-
gether they had endured, the varied experiences
of good times and bad, had bound them together
in links stronger than steel.
