To a child whose infancy had shuddered at
the story of the Nat Turner insurrection of
L832, the John Brown raid in 1859 was a sub-
ject of horrible fascination, and I listened in-
tently as Colonel Lee talked of this strange old
fanatie and his followers.
“What do you think would be the effeet upon
the negro, Mr. Corbell,’ Colonel Lee asked my
father, “if we should be compelled to hang Jolin
Brown?”
My father replied, “Well, ’ve thought of that,
too, Colonel, and I asked my foreman, who is
a representative of lis race, if he did not think
we ought to hang old John Brown. He looked
at me earnestly for a while then, shaking his
head slowly, said, “IT knows, Marse Dae, dat po’
Marse John done en bruk de law, killin’ all dem
mens; but den, Marse Dae, even ef po’ Marse
John did bre’k de law, don’t you think, suh, dat
hangin’ him would be a W’l abrupt?”
Colonel Lee laughed and replied, “I think that
just about expresses the sentiment not only of
the colored people but of many others.” They
agreed that Jolin Brown was an honest, earnest,
courageous old man and that his friends ought
to put him where he would be eared for.
My eyes were turned steadily toward Colone!]
Lee with a large measure of that admiration
he won from observers older and more experienced than I.
