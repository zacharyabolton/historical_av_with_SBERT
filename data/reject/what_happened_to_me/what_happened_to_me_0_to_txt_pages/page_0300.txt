284 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
Uncle Tom pointed to a bucket of water and
looking at the General said:
“Yas, suh, Marsa; I spec’ dat’s so. En, suh,
ef I had dat pail er water in hell I could git a
inillion er dollars fer it.”
The visitors were also amused by the division
of the plantation property, as explained by the
servants,
“Whose horse is that?” asked General Tom
Pitcher of one of the boys “mindin’ de cows.”
“Dat hawss? W’y, Marsa, hawsses allers
longs ter de men-folks, so cou’se dat hawss
belongs ter Marse George.”
“And whose cows are those?”
“De woman-folks allers owns de cows, so
cou’se dey’s Miss Sally’s cows.”
“Whose chickens are those in the yard?”
“Dey’s woman’s t’ings, too, en cou’se dey’s
Miss Sally’s.”
“To whom do those mules belong?”
“Dey’s jest only mules en dey don’ hab no
owners. Dey don’ b’long ter nobody ’specially,
en don’ nobody want ’em ’specially cep’n fer ter
wwk. Dey’s dif’unt fum udder prop’ty; dey
ain’ one ting ner de udder.”
Looking up General Pitcher saw a flock of
wild ducks flying across the river in delightful
irresponsibility.
“Whose ducks are those?” he asked.
