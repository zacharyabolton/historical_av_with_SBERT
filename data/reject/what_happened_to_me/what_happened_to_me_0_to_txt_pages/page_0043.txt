by the spirits and written there. The trees
were centuries old and held the ancient Bible
stories recorded before the alphabet was in-
vented, when the art of reading was among the
undiscovered things, and not even the earliest
picture-writing had been evolved. It was only
the most important messages that the Lord
would permit to be confided to the old trees.
Some of the spirit records had broken lines
and the servants said that the angel’s wing was
broken as he brought the message down. There
was a deep and fearsome scar on one of the
“host trees” which indicated a tragedy, past
or to come, and I used to gaze upon it with awe-
some wonder, trying to read its dread meaning.
A few years later a great tragedy came and
the blackness of it shrouded our whole nation,
but whether that was what the old tree prophecy
meant I know not.
