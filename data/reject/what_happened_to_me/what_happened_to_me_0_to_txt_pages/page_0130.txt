1146 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
Ordway, pin tuberoses tied with crépe on the
lapels of those who with sad hearts followed
their honored leader for the last time. At the
grave each soldier took off his flower and laid it
on the sacred mound.
The question asked in °61, “Who is this T. J.
Jackson?” had been answered from many a
battlefield. When the shot that struck him
down sent its mournful message around the
world the fullest response to that query came
from the mourning hearts of friend and foe
alike. Beyond the sea he was recorded as “one
who took to a soldier’s grave the love of the
whole world and the name of Stonewall Jack-
son,”
General Garnett was one of those who had
been hurt by the severity of the hero’s military
discipline. My Soldier had charge of General
Jackson’s funeral and Garnett came to him and
asked permission to take part. Of all who fol-
lowed the great soldier to his grave there was
no mourner more sincere. All antagonisms were
drowned in the flood of veneration which surged
around his name and fame.
