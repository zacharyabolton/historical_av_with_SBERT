Ju my garden a lily grew, blossoming in
snowy purity, fragrant sweetness and stately
grace. It held the summer in its golden heart
and the love of the angels erowned its radiant
petals. It bade me “good-inorning” and the
dawn was bright with promise. It waved a
earess to me in the soft winds of the Junetide
noon and the day was filled with light and love.
It shone in mystie silver through the moonlight
and my night was aglow with dreams.
Thus a Lily-Soul blooms in the garden of
my life to make it glad with the glory and fra-
grance of her blossoming. Many hearts are
happy because of the flowers of Love and Hope
and Faith which she has planted. Many a life
which in its early dawn held little promise of
good has grown into usefulness and beauty in
the brightness that the Lily-Soul has given of
her own loveliness to light the dim pathway.
In cloudy days the whiteness of the Lily-Soul
has shone like a star through my darkness and
the sunlight in her golden heart has illumined
the black veil of sorrow.
