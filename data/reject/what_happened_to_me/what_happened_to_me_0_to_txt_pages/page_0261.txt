WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 245
The next day the captain went into the cell
and the surgeon, closing the door, turned to the
sentinel and said:
“Guard that door well and see that it is not
opened until [ come back. That man in there is
my relation, but we must not trust him too far.”
Having thus secured for the caller an unin-
terrupted interview with Mr. Davis, the surgeon
continued on his way.
“Mr. Davis, I have only a few moments be-
fore the doctor finishes his round. Can I do
anything for you?—anything? Tell me, quick.”
“No; there is nothing, my young friend—noth-
ing; but I thank you for the wish.”
The captain took from his pocket a eheque-
book and pencil, saying:
“Write on the backs of these cheques any
messages or letters you may want to send and
I will see that they reach their destination.”
Mr. Davis replied:
“T cannot do that. No; you would be risking
your life.”
“T have risked my life before and now would
risk my soul for you. But there is no danger,
Mr. President.”
Mr. Davis wrote messages on three of the
cheques, one to Senator Wall, of New Jersey,
one to a friend in Pennsylvania, a third to an-
other friend whose name I have forgotten.
