caught up her long hanging hair and tried to
rub away the stain. With her great awe-com-
pelling eyes fixed upon her hand she uttered
the words, “Out, damned spot!” in a tone of
anguished despair that thrilled me with terror.
She did not act Lady Maebeth; she ieas Lady
Maebeth in all her pride, all her ambition, all
her determination, all her despair. She said
that she did not like to play the character be-
cause it exhausted her. It is easy to under-
stand that a woman of cold and unserupulous
ambition would drain the life of one so gentle
and sweet-natured as Charlotte Cushman.
In this engagement she did not play Nancy
Sikes, but she gave us her characterization of
the part because my Soldier wanted to see it.
Lawrence Barrett described it accurately when
he said: “It sounded as if she spoke through
blood.” She was one of the few to whom a set
stage with scenery and music and costumes and
an audience are not necessary in the production
of artistic effects. A private room, or a grassy
plot under a tree, or an open space in the sun-
shine, was all the stage she required, one soul
that understood her was audience enough, and
when she threw herself into the character she
represented no one would have known whether
she wore the garb of a beggar or a queen.
I told her of having met Ellen Tree in Canada.
