199 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
In spite of the partings, the loss of our cause,
our disappointment and poverty, there was a
sweet, restful, peaceful feeling of thankfulness
in my heart and gratitude because the war was
over, my husband had been spared and belonged
now only to me; we were going home together,
free from intrusion, to live our own lives.
