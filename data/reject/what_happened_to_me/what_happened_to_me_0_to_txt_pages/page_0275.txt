WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 259
The next time we saw Joe Jefferson he gave a
performance in Richmond and turned over the
whole proceeds to a war-ruined Confederate
who had assisted him in early days, all in such
a quiet manner as to fulfill the spirit of the
Scriptural injunction regarding the right and
left hands. The kindness which was shown by
the wealthy tobaceonist—the seeming favorite
of fortune—to the poor lad in the beginning of
that career the distinction of which, even then,
could be foretold, was thus gracefully repaid
a thousand times by the successful actor. .
Our landlady made a tour of inspection of all
the rooms every Iriday, but to us she made her
visits longer each time, showing a growing in-
terest in our affairs. She could not solve the
mystery of our having come from such a
palatial home to her boarding-house. Then, too,
one of iny “shilling visitors” happening to be
the Governor-General and another an English
officer, they were also a cause of wonder. She
was so insistent in this unbounded curiosity
that we were compelled to seek a larger house
where we should be more lost to sight, especially
as just at this time two prominent Southern
gentlemen, Mr. Beverly Tucker and Mr. Beverly
Saunders, had been gagged and taken through
the lines, though their release was immediately
demanded by the English government.
