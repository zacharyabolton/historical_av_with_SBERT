Her little twins, my foster sisters, Mary-
Frances and Arabella, were placed in the care
of the “orphan tenders,” Mammy Duilsey and
Ole-Granny-Aggie, the latter claiming to be
more than a hundred years old. A cow was set

soon learned that the tinkle of the cow-bells
meant for them a banquet of rich warm milk.
For awhile they were brought up twice a day
to the “Gre’t House” to see “dar Mammy” and
sometimes were permitted to partake of the
erumbs that fell from the “rich baby’s table,”
which crumbs they soon disdainfully refused,
showing their preference for the libations of
“Spotty Sookey,”’ that being the name of their
barnyard cow.
