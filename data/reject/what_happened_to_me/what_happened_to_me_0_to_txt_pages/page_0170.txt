156 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
to his dear little wife. “What do you think of
this? I always did believe every word of those
Ali Baba and Forty Thieves and Magic Lantern
tales and this proves them, for they are not a
bit stranger than this sour buttermilk story.”
The stranger was Colonel William UH. Low-
dermilk, of Anglim’s Bookstore. When later I
lost all my worldly goods and was appointed
to a desk in the Pension Office, Colonel Lowder-
milk, then of the firm of Lowdermilk & Com-
pany, Book-Dealers, wrote to the Commissioner
of Pensions a strong letter of commendation, in
which he told in warmest terms of my care of
himself and other Union soldiers in Libby
prison, and asked that every courtesy and con-
sideration be shown to me for al] time and in
every possible way, in sacred memory of the
boys in Libby. Throughout his life afterward
he was a devoted, loyal friend to me and mine.
