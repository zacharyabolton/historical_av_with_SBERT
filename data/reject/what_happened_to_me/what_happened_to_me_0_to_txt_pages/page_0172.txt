158 WHAT ILAPPENED TO ME
“Here, take this,” said my Soldier. “Hat it,
and when you are rested and have slept go back
home.”
The soldier took the luncheon gratefully.
“No, Marse George,” he answered, “if I get
strength to go on [ll follow you and Marse Rob-
ert to the last.”
He did follow to the last, being killed a few
days later at Sailor’s Creek, where the parting
salute was fired over the grave of the Con-
federacy.
‘“They failed and fell, who bade the sun in heaven to
stand,
We failed and fell, who set our bars against the
progress of the stars,
And stayed the mareh of Motherland.”’
Many months before the farewell shot, when
some one applied to President Lincoln for a
pass to go into Richmond, he gravely replied:
“T don’t know about that; I have given passes
to about two hundred and fifty thousand men
during the last two years to go to Richmond,
and not one of them has got there yet.”
Some of those passes had been used and their
bearer had arrived at last, having made the
slowest time on record since the first camel
bore the pioneer traveler over an Oriental des-
ert. The queen city of the South had fallen.
