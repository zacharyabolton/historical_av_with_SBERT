960 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
Much to my husband’s relief, I volunteered to
assume the disagreeable task of notifying her,
which notice she seemed intuitively to have an-
ticipated and determined to thwart by telling
of her troubles, all of which she laid at her hus-
band’s door.
“He is got so high-minded now,” she said, “he
refuses to blacken all the boots at night—leaves
the top floor ones till morning. Wants to set
upstairs with me and the girls, instead of stay-
ing down in the kitchen, looking for chaws and
to be handy; expects us to lnunt tins to shine and
mend, and nails to drive; won’t eat the boarders’
leavings; reads the Stateser’s newspaper that
he sends to his girl; sets on it when he hears us
coming; took money from Stateser, too, and
was that sly he was going to spend it on himself,
and I giving him all he needs.”
Taking advantage of her pause for sympathy,
I edged in my notice. She immediately put all
the blame of our going on “that Johnson,” and,
though I assured her that he had nothing what-
ever to do with it, wailed:
“You ean’t fool us, you can’t fool us——he
drives every boarder out of the house.”
Our next rooms opened on the Champs de
Mars, the attractions of which in part made up
for the loss of the veranda, but not for that of our
“Left-handers,” who had made oases in our lives.
