2976 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
I had gone with my husband to hunt rabbits
and birds—a hunt more for the meat than the
sport in those poverty-stricken days when our
larders were greatly dependent upon the water
and the woods.
The day was fine and the dew was yet
glistening as we eame suddenly and without
warning within touch of the gray broken
monument shut in and surrounded by the great
forest trees. In silence and solemn awe, in
the strange light and sudden coolness beneath
the shadows my hero-soldier stacked bis gun
and, raising his hat, gently and silently reached
for my hand. I slipped it into his and drew
elose to him. Birds were singing in the dis-
tance.
“God’s choir,’ he said, and in his beautiful
voice sang his favorite hymn, “Guide me, oh,
thou great Jehovah.” Then he taught me these
lines:
““The groves are God’s first temples. Ere man
learned
To hew the shaft and lay the arehitrave,
And spread the roof above them,—ere he framed
The lofty vault to gather and roll back
The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood,
Amidst the cool and silenee, he knelt down
And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks
And supplieation.”’
