CHURCH VISITORS
Y grandmother’s old colonial home,
Holiday’s Point, so-called because of
the many holidays that my grandfather
had been accustomed to give his servants, was
on the Nansemond River, in Nansemond chant
Phe county came into existence in 1639, being
first called Upper Norfolk. Its name was soon
_. changed to Nansemum, spelled by Captain John
Car ET The Dismal Swamp ex-
ends along its edge. Its county-seat is Suf-
folk, the burning of which I, as a child, have
often heard deseribed by Ole-Granny-Aggie,
an eye-witness, while we would listen with bated
breath, hair on end and nerves aquiver.
“No, chillun,” she would say, “jedgment day
ain’t agwine to be no mo’ tur’ble to ’sperience
dan de burnin’ of we-all’s county-town by dem
furrin Britishers was, en de niggers en de white
folks ain’t agwine to be no skeerder den, nee-
der.”
