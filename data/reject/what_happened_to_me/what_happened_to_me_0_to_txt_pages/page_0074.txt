60) WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
“My child, when great-grandfathers were
little babies this—” taking out his tobacco-bag
and filling his pipe from it—‘was the only real
money in this country and was of greater value
than the kind which you now hold in your little
hand.”
Then he went on to tell me in words that a
child could understand that money debts were
not even reeoverable. Tobacco debts only were
valid, and to sell bad tobacco or pay a debt with
it was a crime, precisely as it is now to sell or
pay counterfeit money. Tobacco was the cur-
renecy, and an excess was as injurious as an
over-issue of bank paper, depreciating on the
market and causing everything to rise in price.
(rreat care was taken to burn bad tobacco, and
it was as important to the uniformity of the
currency in those days as is now the exclusion
of counterfeits. All the viewings, censorships,
inspections and regulations of the amount of
tobacco to be cultivated by each planter, the
quality to be gathered from each plant, the
rules prescribed, were as important as the laws
of the mint are now.
Judge Mason’s tobaceo-bag was the next sub-
ject of my inguiry.
“isn’t eloth-eloth. Is it tobaeco-cloth?” I
asked. “Did people have tobaeeo-cloth as well
as tobacco-money in those days?”
