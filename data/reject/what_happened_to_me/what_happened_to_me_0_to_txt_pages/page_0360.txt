340 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
and if | ean be of any service, Prince, just call
on me.”
I never heard whether the Prince returned
the Colonel’s slap but T know that he accepted
the cordiality in the same spirit in which it was
offered. We visited the Colonel’s stables and
discussed the pedigree of his fine thoroughbred,
dreve with him behind his fastest trotter, and
so liked the old Virginia mint juleps whieh he
drank with his host, that he asked for and re-
ceived the recipe for making them and took it
back with him to the motherland, with some
mint roots to plant in his palace garden.
The Colonel was our life-long friend and de-
voted to our children who, while they returned
his affeetion, stood in awe of him from the
time that he gave them a graphic illustration,
by pulling lis wig awry and turning his eye-
hds wrong side out, of what had happened to
“peeping, prying, inquisitive Jerry.”
On our return from Salt Sulphur Springs the
summer our little Corbell was in his eighth vear,
as we drove up to the Exchange Hotel the dear
old Colonel came out to the carriage and said:
“Your rooms are all ready, General. We re-
ceived your telegram and prepared for your
coming, but we have two eases of measles here,
so [ have arranged to have you taken eare of at
the Monumental Hotel till the danger is over.”
