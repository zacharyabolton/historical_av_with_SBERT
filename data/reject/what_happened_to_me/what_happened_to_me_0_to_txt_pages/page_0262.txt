246 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
“You can write to Mrs. Davis that you have
seen me. ‘Take my love to all my friends. I
leave them in God’s care. This means to me
more than all the doctor’s medicine--this one
glimpse of one who says, ‘Mr. President’—-who
eomes to me and recognizes all that I have tried
to do for my people.”
Just as the cheque-book was returned to its
place the surgeon came in, looking at him sus-
piciously. Seeing nothing, and knowing that
there was no pen, ink or paper in the room, he
went out, followed by the visitor.
Early next day Captain Bright left for
Williamsburg. When he and the surgeon were
on the wharf some soldiers came forward.
“Halt!” commanded the captain.
“What does this mean?” asked the surgeon.
‘We are ordered to search this gentleman,”
was the explanation.
“This gentleman is my kinsman and my
guest,” said the surgeon.
After consultation with the officers the em-
barrassment was relieved by the countermand-
ing of the order and Captain Bright departed
with the precious messages in his pocket.
“The feeling of fear,” he wrote, “came to me
for the first time in all my life; not for myself
but for that beloved old man who is dear now to
us all.”
