“Dear Mother, you’ve got me and Dear
Father; don’t ery—please, Dear Mother. I saw
Mammy-Mary again but she shook her head at
us and pointed up here to you and so Dear
Father wouldn’t stop her. Oh, she looked most
as dead as you do, Dear Mother.”
“Why do you call me differently, dear?” I
asked,
“Tt don’t know,” he replied, “but the words
‘Dear Mother’ just came to me and choked up
in my throat and so I said them out.”
From that time to him I was always “Dear
Mother.”
From the walls of a convent in France for
many years came at Easter time a message of
love, a book, an embroidered flower, a letter or
a prayer. Then, when all had been taken from
me and I needed her most, only silence came,
and I knew that she, too, had passed beyond.
