2830 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
down with him to take the steamer to Rich-
mond my Soldier, unobserved, took a ten-dollar
gold piece from his pocket and dropped it in
the road, hoping that the old Major would find
it. But the veteran walked by without secing it.
So his friend was compelled to find it himself.
Three times the ruse was played and at last the
Major saw the eoin and, picking it up, offered
it to his companion. ‘No, it belongs to you,”
said the General. ‘You must have dropped it,”
urged the Major. “I?” was the query. “How
could I have a gold piece?) The Yankees are
about the only people who have been down in
this country with gold, and now that you have
found it, it belongs to you.” After a long dis-
cussion the Major was induced to accept the law
that “finders is owners,” and he put the gold in
his pocket.
