WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 3817
were colored. Tinding that the child could not
become aceustomed to “black hands” and that
his health was endangered by his efforts to over-
come a weakness that seemed congenital, we
advertised for a white nurse but with no suec-
cess. Hearing us talk about advertising, Cor-
bell asked God to put in a “’tisement” for a
white nurse for him. He prayed for everything
he wanted and asked the Lord to do things for
him that his father and mother could not do, at
the same time begging the Father in Heaven
not to let us know that he had appealed to a
higher power, lest our feelings be hurt.
We were staying at the Ballard and Exchange
Hotel in Richmond. One morning as we were
going out for our daily ride a beautiful woman
dressed in deep mourning was standing in the
hall. With a startled expression she held out
her hands and my little Corbell ran into her
arms, exclaiming:
“Oh, you are the dear, good God's ’tisement
and you have come to be my nurse and take my
’Carthy’s place. See, our mother, see! Black
hands won’t ever, ever make creeps in me any
more, now that our Father who art in Heaven
has sent the ’tisement to me.”
The stranger clasped the child to her heart,
kissing his golden curls and sweet brown eyes
while her tears fell.
