(2 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
mother stood by a table whereon was a large
bow] of egg-nog from which, with a silver ladle,
she was filling glasses for us all, for even the
babies in old Virginia were given a taste of
egg-nog on Christmas morning.
After breakfast my grandmother went to ser-
vice and would return with guests who were to
come to us after the Christmas sermon in the
lavishly decorated village church.
Soon the first carriage rolled into the yard,
the eoachman proudly flourishing the whip,
which he used merely as an insignia of his of-
fice. “Dar dey come! Dar dey come! Dar
dey come!” We all ran out to welcome the
visitors. The carriage doors were opened, the
steps folded up on the inside were let down,
and the servants called out “Christmus gif’,
Marse, Christmus gif’, Missus,” all holding out
their hands and clamoring as my uncle emerged
from the coach, “I eotch him firs’! I eoteh him
firs’! I eotch Miss firs’, didn’ I, Marse?” each
claiming the reward, regardless of actual prior-
ity in time.
My uncle was immaculate in frock coat and
trousers of black broadcloth, new boots, snowy
linen front trimmed profusely with ruffles, high
collar and stock and shining silk hat. He turned
with courtly grace and helped Auntie from the
carriage.
