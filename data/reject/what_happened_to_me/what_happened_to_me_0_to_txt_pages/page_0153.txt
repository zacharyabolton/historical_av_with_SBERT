WHAT HAPPENED TO ME — 139
tack a part of the South Carolina brigade came
in and, being placed at Walthall Junction, about
six miles from Petersburg, drove back Butler’s
advance column. Wise’s Virginia brigade ar-
rived on the seventh and was sent toward City
Point. Then three brigades of Pickett’s division
began coming in as fast as the crippled ex-
press could bring them, and we had eleven
pieces of artillery.
We women carried the dispatehes, cooked the
food and took it to the men at the guns. At
train time we would go to the station and send
up cheer after cheer of weleome, hoping to blind
the Federals to the fact that the cars, returning
from their short trip to the country, brought in
only the half-starved railroad men. The roar
of cannon and the shrieks of shot and_ shell
filled our ears day and night. Durmg the en-
tire week, until Petersburg was safe and Gen-
eral Grant bad sent his famous telegram to Mr.
Lincoln, “Pickett has bottled up Butler at
Petersburg,’ my Soldier scarcely slept, and I
saw him only when I carried to him on the lines
a dispatch or his bread and soup and coffee.
This telegram so angered Butler that he came
up the James River, out of the line of battle,
at great expense to the United States Govern-
ment, and sacked and burned my Soldier’s beau-
tiful ancestral home.
