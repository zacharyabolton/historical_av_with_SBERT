204 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
Already bright visions and happy day-dreams
flit through my brain and thrill my heart; so
keep up a ‘skookum tum-tum,’ little one, and
take care of yourself. Watch for the telegram,
‘Hdwards is better,’ for it will surely come.”
I smiled up at him as he repeated the familiar
old saying, learned from an old Chinook war-
rior on the Pacific. In the darkest days he
would lift my face upward, look down with his
kind eyes and gentle smile and say, “Keep up
a skookum tum-tum, dear one.” All through
my life have the sweet old words come back
to me when the sun has been hidden by the dark-
est clouds.
I heard the footsteps of the horse keeping
time to my Soldier’s whistle, “Believe me if all
those endearing young charms,’ away in the
distance long after he was out of sight. I re-
membered a trick of my childhood which had
been taught me by a half-Indian, half-negress
and, putting my ear to the ground, I listened to
the steps until the last echo was lost. Later I
learned that the faithful Luey bore her master
safely to the station and when the train carried
him away lay down and died, as if she felt that,
having done all she could, life held for her no
more duties or pleasures.
The night-wind sighed with me as I walked
back, repeating, “Keep up a skookum tum-tum.”
