WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 121
of his division and they were then in camp on
the Blackwater a few miles distant.
When the division crossed the Blackwater and
marched on to Suffolk I went to the home of
my aunt, Mrs. Eley, at Barber’s Cross Roads,
a distance of about ten miles from Suffolk.
Here when all was quiet along the hnes my
Soldier would ride in from his headquarters al-
most every night between the hours of sunset
and sunrise to see me—a ride of about thirty
niles. While these short visits were glimpses
of heaven to me, they resulted sadly for my
aunt, whose house, in consequence, was burned
by the Federals.
At the earnest solicitation of my Soldier, who
feared my remaining within the enemy’s lines,
T went to an old friend in Richmond, Mrs.
Shields, the wife of Colonel Shields. When on
this visit I first met General “Jeb” Stuart, the
“Red Fox” of the Confederacy, thus named be-
cause of the blonde glory of his coloring and
the swiftness of his movements, as well as his
wiliness in evading pursuit. He was said to
be one of the handsomest men in the South,
and perhaps it was true, but I was at that time
too much absorbed in the contemplation of the,
to me, handsomest man in the world to have
discriminating eyes for the beauty of anyone
else.
