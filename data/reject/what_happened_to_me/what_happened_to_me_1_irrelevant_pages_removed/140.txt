126 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
Only a few days before he had ridden from
Gettysburg to Richmond, cheer after cheer fol-
lowing him along the way. Men, women and
children were at the roadside to welcome him
and hang garlands on his horse. Ile had been
the central figure in a scene so supreme that it
needed not victory to crown it with glory. Yet
‘not the flowers of love nor the echo of the can-
non’s thunder, the grave duties nor the heavy
sorrows that were laid upon him, could so fill
his heart as to leave no room for the ery of suf-
fering from an unknown child.
