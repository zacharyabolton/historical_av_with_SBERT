WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 357
good night. Now, please, Doctor, excuse me,
but won’t you all go and leave me alone with
my wife? You have tried to save me for her
and [ thank you. Now, all that you can do for
me is to say good night.”
Just as they were going my unele, Colonel
Philips, and his wife came in with our little
boy, who was staying with them.
“Well, Colonel,” said my Soldier, “the enemy
is too strong for me again, you see, and, Colonel
~<my ammunition is all out. JI am glad you
have both come. Thank you, and now good
night, my dear friend; you are the last old com-
rade to whom I shall give an order-—wateh over
my wife and child.”
Calling our boy he said:
“Crawl up here by ‘Dear Father,’ my baby,’
and laying his hand on our boy’s head he closed
his eyes and there was silence in the room.
Presently he spoke:
“This is the month that God sent you to us,
my boy, and this is the month, I am afraid, that
God is going to call me away from you. You
must take my place at the side of your Dear
Mother, begin at once to be the little husband
to her, the little man for her, and I will watch
over you and help you to perform all these
offices.”
“What are officers?” asked the child.
