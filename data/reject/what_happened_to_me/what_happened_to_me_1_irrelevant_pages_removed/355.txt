Charlotte Cushman’s manner was the opposite

Speaking of Joe Jefferson she said:
“T think his paintings are as marvelous as his
acting, and the colors in his voice blend as per-

He could fool himself into thinking that what-
ever he acted was a fact, and his audience read-
ily took the same view.”
