290 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
of having an operation performed on her dear
eyes? We had consulted the best surgeons and
had been assured that it was a very simple thing
and not at all dangerous, so we decided to have
it done. As the time grew near I got to worry-

always been. Arrangements had been made;

stopped and said:

to say this; but I don’t want your eyes changed.
They look just as they did the first time I ever

fell in love with you—the same that looked up
into mine and told me that my love was re-
turned. I have seen that expression in them
through all the years and I don’t want it to be
lost. You might look better to other people, but
to me you are prettier as you are. So, if you
don’t mind, please let’s keep your dear eyes just
as they always have been’
