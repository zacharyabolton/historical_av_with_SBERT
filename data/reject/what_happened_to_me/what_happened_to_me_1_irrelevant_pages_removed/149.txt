It was while my Soldier was stationed at

Plymouth. The military history of the move-

to the old North State was made. I went as

road.
The night was bleak and frigid; we were near-
ing our stopping place. My Soldier, always
solicitous for his men, was discussing with his
staff the discomfort to which they would be
subjected and the impossibility of alleviating
their suffering.
“Poor fellows!” he said. “They will be al-
most frozen and no wood, and General Lee will
not allow us to burn even a single rail. There
