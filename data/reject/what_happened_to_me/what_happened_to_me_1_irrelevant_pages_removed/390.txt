OU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
J remember the long procession of mourners
that followed him through the streets of Rich-
mond to the beautiful resting place of Holly-
wood, the longest funeral procession, they told
me, that had ever been known in Richmond.
His staff officers, couriers and headquarters
guard met again to follow him as loyally as
when he led them into the whirlwind of battle.
His old soldiers who had Jeaped at the flash-
ing of his sword and dashed with him against
the gates of death, and who were now scattered
through far distant States, had rallied to the
eall of the unblown bugle and the unvoiced com-
mand of their beloved leader to mareh behind
him for the last time. Those who had followed
other leaders came to do honor to the memory
of the great soldier who had fought for the
cause dear to them all.
A few years later another procession marehed
down the streets of Richmond to the sacred
ground of Hollywood to attend the dedication
of Gettysburg Monument, erected to the mem-
ory of my Soldier and his brave menâ€”the first
Confederate Monument. Again Southern veter-
ans assembled in honor of their leader and of
their gallant comrades. Loyal to them and the
past, they came from many States, faithful as in
the days of fire and storm, bringing their treas-
ure of memories to Jay on that sacred shrine.
