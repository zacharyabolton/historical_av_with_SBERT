346 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
child in the dawn of Good Friday had saved
him.
A year later, when my Soldier went home and
little Corbell was placed beside him, the chil-
dren of this man came to me and said, “We are
sorry Corbell is taken away, for we have been
putting flowers on his grave every day, as our
papa told us. But we can just as well put them
here and on the General’s grave, too.”
The long Saturday passed and Easter Sun-
day came over the hills in the whiteness of its
lilies and with melodious chimes rang out the
blessed tidings that a Saviour had risen to
bring Heaven to the world. But the golden
light brought no dawn of hope to the hearts of
those who watched sorrowfully over the little
life that was drifting out upon that sea of glori-
ous music into the Heaven of which it gave glad
promise. Lulled to rest while the children sang
their Easter carols, our boy went to join his
brother angels. Through the open window the
voices were sounding “Christ is risen” as he
turned his head and laid his face against mine
and reached out his little hand to my Soldier
and Mary. I felt his spirit flutter and go. With
a shivering sigh for me his soul slipped through
the gate that Christ had risen to unlock.
During his long illness thoughtful friends
from everywhere had been untiring in kindness.
