WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 6]
“NO; this is rattlesnake skin. ‘The snake was
killed by Charles Lewis, who lived a long time

him, tied his hands behind him and made him
walk two hundred miles. As they were going
along a high precipice he broke the cords and
jumped down. The Indians followed and he
escaped by springing over a fallen tree, land-
ing among the tall weeds. His pursuers did
not see him fall and they jumped over both the
tree and the man and ran on as fast as they

snake almost touching him. It moved its rattles
and twice they rested upon his ear and neck.
He was so numbed with fright that he could

to think he was dead, and so wriggled away.
