WHAT HAPPENED TO ME _ 249
“That man of mine,” she sorrowfully said,
“is a soggy Englishman, and you would hardly
believe it possible he could be the father of
our two beautiful daughters. Both of them are
going to do well, but they don’t take after their
pa. The oldest is engaged to be married to a
Stateser with nine businesses!”
By the “nine businesses” and “Stateser” I
gathered from her explanation, which she volun-
teered in answer to my puzzled look, that the
fortunate son-in-law-to-be was a Yankee living
in a small town in the State of Vermont, and
owning a little country store where woolen and
cotton goods, silks and flannels, pottery, queen’s-
ware, hardware, groceries, grain, and so forth,
were sold, the precursor of the department
store. In her admiration of him, after each
alleged “business” she affixed the, to her, high-
sounding title of “merchant.”
The second daughter, she told me, was learn-
ing to sing.
“She has a sweet voice, but she don’t take
after her pa,” she said, “and the young preacher
student in the next room to the right of the one
you have chosen is very much taken with her,
and it looks like I’d get both girls off my hands
before long.”
She said she could not give me the use of
the parlors when the girls wanted them.
