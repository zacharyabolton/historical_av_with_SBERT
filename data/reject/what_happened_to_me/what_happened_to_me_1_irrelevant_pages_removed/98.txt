84 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
ong, long iv:
At Riehmond a man in uniform boarded the
train. I looked at him with admiration as he
eame down the aisle. He was tall and walked
ereetly with graceful earriage and a command-
ing air not dependent upon bis military dress.
He stopped and spoke to iny father, who arose,
greeted him eordially and, turning back the
seat, invited him to join us. He accepted and
my father introdueed “Colonel Robert E. Lee.”
The Colonel shook hands with me m a gentle
way and began to barter for one of my long
eurls. In my diffidence I did not close with any
of his offers, though | would have given every
curl on my head for the asking, for even then,
{o my romantic vision, Colonel Lee was a ne)
aman. said that he had just returned frow
per’s Ferry, where there had been great excite-
ment. John Brown had descended upon the
town and taken possession of the United States
Arsenal. Colonel Lee, home on furlough from
the West, had been sent with the marines from
the Washington barracks and four companies
of troops from Fortress Monroe to dispossess
them and restore quiet to the little town in the
Virginia hills. It was not alone Harper’s Ferry
that had been terrorized; the entire state had
been thrown into a turmoil of excitement.
