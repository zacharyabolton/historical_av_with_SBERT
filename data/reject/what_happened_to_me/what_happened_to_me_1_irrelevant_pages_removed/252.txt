236 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
confiscated and given to those whom they have
so long and so cruelly wronged.‚Äù
As he in detail related the story of the seanty
allowance of the prisoners, the filth and dark-
ness of their cells, I longed to stand and plead
for my people, and tell how they, too, were with-
out soap, food or clothes; that we had no medi-
eines, even, except what were smuggled through
the lines, and that our own poor soldiers were
barefooted and starving, and that all the suffer-
ing of prisoners on both sides could have been
avoided by carrying out the terms proposed
by the Confederate Government. If I had only
dared to raise the veil and reveal the truth per-
haps sympathy might have tempered their bit-
terness, the flame of divine kinship smouldering
in their veins, hidden as in a tomb, might have
miraged over the gulf of wrongs a bridge of
holier feelings.
Yet the memory of the woman whose son had
been killed on the field of Gettysburg and whose
lily, now browned and withered with the years, I
eherishwith such tender care, softened the words
that were like blows to my ear and heart. Thus
the power of one pure heart radiating its love
upon the world as an odorous flower diffuses
fragrance on the surrounding atmosphere, up-
lhitts the sorrowing spirit and strengthens it to
withstand the rude assaults of avindictive world.
