WHAT HAPPENED TO ME 263
that I was looking pale, and suggested that I
go out for a little fresh air.
HNagerly taking advantage of the excuse thus
offered, I put on my bonnet and went down to
the office and took from my box in the safe an
old-fashioned set of emeralds and, asking the
proprietor to direct me to the most reliable
jeweler and to send some one to sit with my hus-
band until my return, went out.
I had had very little experience in buying of
merehants, and none whatever in selling to
them, but I feigned great wisdom and dignity
as ] told the young man who stepped forward to
wait upon me that my business was with the
head of the firm. He took me back to an inner
office, where an old man with grizzly-gray hair
and a very moist countenance was looking in-
tently, through something which very much re-
sembled a napkin-ring screwed into his right
eye, at some jewels lying on a tray before him.
H{e wore lis teeth on the outside of his mouth,
and his upper lip was so drawn, in the intensity
of his look, as to be almost hidden under his
over-reaching nose. His face, too, was wrinkled
up into a thousand gullies in his concentration
upon his work.
“We don’t hemploy young women ’ere,” he
said, looking up and frowning as he suddenly
became aware of my presence.
