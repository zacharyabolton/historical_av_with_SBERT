WHAT HAPPENED TO ME © 341
We thought it best not to run any risk, and
went to the Monumental. The rooms were large
and comfortable. Dr. and Mrs. Barksdale were
the first to greet us. They, too, with several
others of our friends who had little children,
had been obliged to leave the Exchange for the
same reason,
Our precautions proved in vain, for my sister,
a young lady just entering society, who was
staving with us, was stricken with the disease,
and my schoolboy brother and my two children
eaught the contagion. At the end of three
months, however, all were well exeept our beau-
tiful, gifted, wonderful boy, our little Corbell,
always a delicate child, who now became weaker
day by day.
There was never anything like the goodness
of the people of Richmond in those trying
months. Relatives, friends and strangers came
daily with toys, hooks, good things, carriages, as
long as we could take our darling to ride, for
his beautiful angel face, his wonderful mind and
his glorious voice had won a place in every heart.
While Corbell was ill Mr. Davis called on us
for the last time, as he was never again in Rich-
mond. When he eame in I drew up a chair for
him, but he said:
“May I not sit on the bed beside our sick
boy ?”
