62 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
abounded in great plenty, but the red clover
was not known until the blood of the red man,
shed by the Lewises and their followers, sud-
denly dyed the trefoil to its sanguinary hue.
The Indians fully believed this legend and su-
perstitiously held the red clover sacred. The
superstition spread among the settlers and for
a long time the milk of a cow that had eaten the
blood-stained blossom was believed to be tainted
with blood.
Little Ned Drewry, the third occupant of the
gig, with a boy’s natural indifference to poetic
effusion, had slipped away during my “twinkle
little star” and was playing “paterroller” with
the colored children and the bloodhounds, and
my elders began to talk of the man for whom
he was named, a victim of the Nat Turner insur-
rection. I was not usually permitted to hear
such gruesome stories, but if they thought of
me at all they must have supposed that I was
too young to understand or too sleepy to notice.
So they told some of the painful incidents con-
nected with the startling episode of 1832, while
T leaned back in my chair and drooped my little
head. Judge Mason’s sister, Mrs. Boykin, my
grandmother’s friend at Old Point Comfort, had
come near being killed in the insurrection. She
was saved by her maid, who hid her in a wood-
pile till the danger was over.
