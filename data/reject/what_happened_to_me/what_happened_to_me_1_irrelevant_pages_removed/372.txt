350 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
“Weeks ago, my lady, when I saw that our
little darling could not live I made all my ar-

taken from me all I had on earth. When you,
too, like me, are bereft of everything come to
me.”
“Passengers for the New York express, time’s
up!’ rang through the hall.
For one minute we were clasped in each
other’s arms; her cold lips pressed mine for the
first time. No word was spoken—she was gone
~~I[ was alone. I looked about me, dazed, eon-
fused. There was my hand satchel packed, a
book and a letter, Marvy’s writing, on the bureau.
Mechanically I picked them up, shuddering as

“Dear Mother, where are you?” George’s
little arms were clasping my knees. “Dear
Father sent me to take care of you till he
comes back. He says he will be up in a minute
for you and J must help you to get ready.”
Always before our precious boy had ealled
me “Our Mama” and his father “Our Papa,” as
he had been taught by his father. I sat down,
taking him in my lap.
“Our Mama’ is ready, my precious boy,” I
said.
