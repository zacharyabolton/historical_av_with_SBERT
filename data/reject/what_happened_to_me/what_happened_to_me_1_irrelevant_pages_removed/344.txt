326 WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
“Yes,” replied General Lee, “but he did not
fight with a sword. He is a preacher, a Bible
teacher, and fights with the spirit.”
“That’s poetry, isn’t it?” asked Corbell.
“Yes; that is poetry.”
“General, Dr. Minnegerode always says his
prayers with me and asks the Lord to bless me
and make me well,” said Corbell.
“May I say my prayers with you, too, my boy,
and ask the Lord to make us both well and bless
us?”
“Yes, General, but you are a soldier, not a
preacher.”
“No, [ am neither now, my little man,” re-
plied the General; “just a poor, sick, helpless
child like you, asking for health.”
We knelt by the bedside and prayed the most
beautiful prayer I ever heard.
It was the last time I saw General Lee.
