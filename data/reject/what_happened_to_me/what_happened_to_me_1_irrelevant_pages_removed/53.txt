apologies for my intrusion upon a stranger, and
the explanation that my nurse had been sent
to the Fort with a note for Lieutenant Pickett,
the son of one of her old friends, asking the
pleasure of his company to dinner. My new-

in «question, expressing his pleasure in the meet-
ing and assuring her that my visit had been a
charming episode in a monotonous waste of
loneliness. I explained:

“Yes, it has all been arranged,” he laughed.
From that time loneliness was at an end for
me. My soldier had no fear of contagion, as-
suring me when I asked him if he was too big
to have whooping cough that it was a privilege
of youth and diminutiveness. We built pine
bark yachts and sailboats and steamers and
sailed them on the lakes we made by damming
up the waves that dashed highest on the
shore. The waves of our lakes washed the
eoasts of every country on the map and our
stately ships brought back to us rich cargoes
from all the countries of the world. We built
forts and garrisoned them with men as brave as
those who fell with Leonidas in the great battle
of which my soldier told me as we worked.
