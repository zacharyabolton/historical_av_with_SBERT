ing. Later, when the devotion of the President
to his old friends and his confidence in them had
given his enemies an opportunity to criticize
with undue severity his habit of making ap-
pointments for friendship rather than politics,
T appreciated still more the generosity and wis-
dom of my Soldier’s refusal. Knowing the de-
mands upon the President, knowing that aecept-
ance of the appointment, sorely as he needed it,
would create for the administration a host of
enemies, he said:
“You eannot afford to do this for me, and I
cannot afford to let you do it.”
“T can afford to do anything I choose,” replied
the President.
I shall never forget the gratitude in my Sol-
dier’s tear-dimmed eyes as he turned them upon
the President, showing his appreciation of the
friendship and sacrifice, nor General Grant’s
look in return, nor what those old soldiers did
-—-never, as silently shaking hands and walking
off in different directions they gazed out of sep-
arate windows, and I stole away.
