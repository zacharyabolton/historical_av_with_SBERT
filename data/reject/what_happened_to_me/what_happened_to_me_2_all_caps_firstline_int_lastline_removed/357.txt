of all. But on coming to Richmond she found
that she did not know anything about the lingo
of the darkies. Being anxious to learn it, she
used to talk with old Wash and Julia, two his-
torieal characters at the Ballard and Exchange
Motel, repeating their expressions over and
over. Later she would try to say them, finding
that she was no more expert than in the begin-
ning. Thus she learned that to know plantation
talk one must be born to it; it eannot be
acquired.
She was at that time victim to a painful and
wasting disease. Seeing her suffering one day
from the treatment for the malady, I said:
“Oh, lamsosorry! You ean’t play to-night.”
“Yes, my dear,” she replied gently, “I shall
play to-night, and, it may be, all the better for
the pain.”
Watching her wonderful performance that
evening I thought it might be that pain is the
gateway to the highest realm of art.
The last time I saw Charlotte Cushman was
in Philadelphia. A great sorrow had shrouded
me from the sunlight, and she tried to shelter
me in the warmth of her own heart.
“You ought to have been an actress,” she said,
“and then you would have regained happiness
by simulating it.”
