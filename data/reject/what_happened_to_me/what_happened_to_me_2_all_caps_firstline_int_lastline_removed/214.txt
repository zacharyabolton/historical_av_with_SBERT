figs—nothing ever had tasted so delicious as all
these good things—and, well—the Yankee Gen-
eral who gave them all to me—the tones of his
voice made more peace than his words. Eating
the figs, I repeated the words to baby, saying:
“Never mind, baby, about hating this Yankee.
He said your father and he had trailed after the
same Indians and smoked their venison at the
same eamp-fire and had drunk from the same
flask. He said you looked like your father, and
he said you were a beautiful boy. So you need
not mind abont hating just this one. He said
geography and politics had forced your father
and nm to opposite courses and it took four
years to settle for their hot-headedness and am-
bitions. You must never be a politician, and—
you may love this one Yankee a tiny bit, and
may suck a piece of his beautiful candy.”
