and a pretty girl in a eap took baby from my
arms.
After that I remember only being tired
tired—-so very tired. When I had rested enough
to think again, I was on a sofa dressed in a
pretty, soft, silken robe, and J heard a kind
voice saying:
“The lady is better; she will be all right. Let
her sleep.”
Glancing up, I saw a benevolent-looking old
gentleman and a pair of spectacles. I closed
my eyes and heard the gentleman with the
familiar face say such beautiful things, and his
voice and touch thrilled my heart so that I kept
my eyes shut and never wanted to open them
again; and presently the pretty girl with the
cap on came in with baby in her arms, dressed
in a beautiful robe.
“Ze petite enfant—very much no hungry now
—he eat trés pap—he sleep—he wash—he dress
~~he eat trés much. He no hungry; he eat some
more trés much again. He smile; he now no
very much hungry again some more.”
Was I in the land of fairies, and was the
gentleman with the familiar face the prince of
fairies, as he was the prince of lovers? Our
baby’s outstretched arms and ery for me as he
recognized me dispelled any such delusion, but
I was too tired to hold out my hands to him.
