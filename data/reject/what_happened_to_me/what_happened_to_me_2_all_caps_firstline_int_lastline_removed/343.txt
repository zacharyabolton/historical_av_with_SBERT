ing my Soldier by his name, which ] had never
before heard him do.
Fle was President at that time of Washington
College, now the Washington-Lee University, at
Lexington, and this was the last time he was
ever in Richmond.
General Lee’s fondness for children made him
always a great favorite with them, and he and
our little Corbell discussed the Old White, its
nasty smelling sulphur-water, and the many
friends they had made there. Uolding up his
little thin hand, Corbell said:
“See, General, how wobbly my hand is. It’s
a heap trembher than Mr. Peabody’s was. 1
can write my name now, but I can’t write it to
do good with and to give things, as Mr. Peabody
did; I wish I could. My, wouldn’t I make it
fly?”
“Your dear little hand does more good than
it could possibly do by writing your name on
paper,” replied General Lee. “It is a hand of
love and that is better than anything else in the
world. I saw Dr. Minnegerode and he told me
how sick you had been and how patient and
sweet you were and how hard you were trying
to get well.”
“Dr. Minnegerode wasn’t a soldier like you
and our papa, was he?” asked our little darling,
shaking his head and changing the subject.
