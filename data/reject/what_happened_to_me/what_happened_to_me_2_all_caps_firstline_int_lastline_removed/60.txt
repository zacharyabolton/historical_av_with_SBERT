Granny-Aggie weave, but to be allowed to sit
at the loom and slide the shuttle through with
my own hands was a special rapture. Yet this
day I did not enjoy it, for I felt that something
unusual had happened and associated it with
my little friend.
The next morning mammy got out my new
silk reins and hitehed up Mary Frances and
Arabella, my “match of blacks,” for me to drive,
and as we returned after a long race I saw an
old gentleman with bent back carrying a bean-
tiful white box into the house.
“Oh, how pretty! What is it for?” I asked
my grandmother.
“A little jewel casket, ny darling, to hold a
keepsake that I am going to send to the angels.
There, there; run along now and play.”
I went into the garden where our own little
bed of white violets was in full bloom, and sud-
denly remembering with a pang that my little
Sara had wanted to gather them all and that |
would let her have only what I saw fit she
should have, I said, “She shall have every one
now,” and gathering my apron almost full I
ran into the house.
The door of the room which had been closed
to me for two days had been accidentally left
ajar and, hearing my grandmother’s voice, I
ran in.
