was Joe Jefferson, whom we saw now for the
first time since meeting him in Canada. On
eoming to Richmond he found that his old
friend, Mr. Caskie, who had helped him to a foot-
hold upon life, had lost his fortune by the war,
and was in even greater need than the unknown
boy had formerly been. The famous comedian
was not one to forget a kindness. ‘“Let’s give
him a benefit,’ he said to my Soldier. IJt was
characteristic of Joe Jefferson that he never
said “I will do” thus and so. He said ‘‘Let’s do
it,’ as if the suecess of the project depended
upon the one to whom he was talking rather
than on his own ability. The benefit was given
and the man of ruined fortunes had reason to
be glad that in the days of the full larder he
had “east his bread upon the waters.”
