The city council of Petersburg voted a resolu-
tion of thanks to my Soldier for his brave de-
fense of the city. The people wished to express
their gratitude by a gift to me. It was im-
possible to buy a service of silver, so each
brought a fork, a salt-spoon, a pitcher, as the
case might be, until more than a thousand pieces
were given to me. One woman, having no silver
beeause she had been compelled to sell her
household service, brought a pretty gilt-bor-
dered cup. The gifts of affection were of far
greater value to me than the most elegant and
eostly new set of silver could have been and
were carefully cherished until, in the fire which
marked the surrender of Richmond, they, with
all my bridal presents and everything of value,
were burned im the warehouse in Richmond
where they had been placed for safe-keeping.
