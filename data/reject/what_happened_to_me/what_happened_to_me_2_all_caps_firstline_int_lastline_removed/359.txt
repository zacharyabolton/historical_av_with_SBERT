EASTER FLOWERS
HE old Ballard and Exchange Hotel in
Richmond, Virginia, celebrated for hav-
ing entertained more distinguished visi-
tors than any other hostelry in this country,
consisted of two houses on opposite sides of the
street, connected by one of the most picturesque
bridges, where the guests found a pleasant
meeting place as they passed from one building
to the other.
Colonel Carrington, the proprietor, was a
courtly, gallant and hospitable old Virginia
gentleman, a peer of peers, yielding to no
superiority of position, as was evidenced in his
reception of the Prince of Wales on his visit to
Richmond. After cordially shaking hands with
the royal visitor he slapped him on the back
and said:
â€œMake yourself at home, Prince, make your-
self at home, sir. I extend to you my heartiest
welcome, sir. Old Wash will look after you
