tioned his prisoners in the trench beside them,
in order that the Confederates might not vield
to the otherwise irresistible temptation to fire
upon them.
Butler may not have been gifted with that
fascinating suavity of demeanor which renders
a man an ever-sparkling ornament to society,
but from a practical business point of view he
was not wholly destitute of commendable quali-
ties. His Dutch Gap Canal is not only a last-
ing monument to his progressive spirit, but a
benefit to commerce and an interesting feature
which has attracted visitors from many nations.
Out on a point of the plantation, back from
the river in a clump of trees—the beginning of
the big woods—is still standing a most inter-
esting monument. The top of it was broken off
by Butler’s troops in a search for hidden treas-
ure. It was erected by William and Mary Ran-
dolph in 1771. The following is a copy of the
inseription on one of its sides:
‘‘The foundation of this pillar was laid in 1771,
when all the great rivers of this country were swept
by inundations never before experienced; which
changed the face of nature and left traces of their
violence that will remain for ages.’’
My first visit to this monument is one of the
sweetest memories of my Turkey Island life.
