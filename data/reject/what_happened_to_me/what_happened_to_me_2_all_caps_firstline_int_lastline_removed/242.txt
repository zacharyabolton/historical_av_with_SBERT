grandad thats all. I says your prayers popsy
evry day fum little mary
Beneath-little Mary’s name was this line:
“Little Mary died on the 16th of May, 1864—
her fifth birthday.”
I rested, but thought of little Mary as I
watched my own baby who was sleeping so
sweetly in this childless stranger’s arms-—till
presently the waves brought back to me the
days of my childhood—the story of the sailor
with his stolen mill, grinding out salt, forever
and forever, and the lost talisman lost still—
back to my grandmother’s knee, listening with
wonder-eyes to “\ is salt,” the while
and tl 1e sha dows rose to make place for one
darker still.
