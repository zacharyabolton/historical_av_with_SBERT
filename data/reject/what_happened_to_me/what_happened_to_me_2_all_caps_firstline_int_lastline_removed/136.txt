Among those of our officers most noted for
personal attractions was General Longstreet,
who was thought to resemble “Jeb” in appear-
ance. <A story is told of an ardent admirer of
the “Red Fox” who, meeting the “old War
Horse,” General Longstreet, said, “General Stu-
art, I just met a man who told me of mistak-
ing you for General Longstreet, but I don’t see
how he could. Longstreet is not half as hand-
some as you are.” General Longstreet gravely
replied, “Yes, I am sometimes taken for Long-
street.”
As we danced at a ball at “Yellow Tavern’
General Stuart teasingly commiserated my Sol-
dier on his bad luck in belonging to the infantry.
“Tam sorry for Pickett, poor fellow! He has
to walk. Upon my word, he ought to be in the
cavalry. He deserves it. What a pity! And
you, Miss Lassie—why should you throw your-
self away on the infantry? You ought to marry
a cavalryman.”
I tried to defend myself and set forth the
greater advantages of the infantry service.
“Pickett is lucky,” he replied, “in having such
a champion. Iam in love with him myself and
agree with you perfectly, for Pickett can do
anything. When I see him dance I think he
ought to be a dancing-master. When I see him
ride I think he ought to be a cavalry leader.
