sad face died away and the look of helpless
suffering returned. Having finished his work
the surgeon said:
“Come, Captain.”
“And is this all?” asked Mr. Davis, as his
visitor passed on and again reverently touched
his arm.
“T would have given my whole fortune,” wrote
the captain, who had just succeeded to an inheri-
tance of considerable value, “to have stayed
there in lis place and let him go free.”
“There is not one of us in all the South, not
a soldier of us, who would not gladly take his
place and save him from humiliation and suffer-
ing,” said my Soldier, looking up from the letter.
Captain Bright pleaded with his kinsman to
let him make another visit and stay long enough
to speak some word of cheer to his heartbroken
chief.
“I do not think that I can,” said the surgeon.
“The risk to us all would be too great.”
“T do not see any risk,” was the reply. “The
whole place isdouble-guarded. Neither that poor
old feeble man nor I could possibly get away.”
As the surgeon really wished to serve his
kinsman, not only in return for past favors but
to be gracious as a host, after refleetion he said:
“To-morrow when I make my rounds I will
try to arrange to leave you there till I return.”
