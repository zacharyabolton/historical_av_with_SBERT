It
THE FIRST PRAYER
TILL euddled among the honeysuckles in
the basket I was carefully lifted from the
carriage.
“Please, Marm, Mistis, lemme carry de set-
tin’-aig-basket in to Mammy Dilsey,”’ pleaded
Pery, the driver, who had taken great pride in
giving me my first ride and covering me
over with his cherished honeysuckle blossoms.
“Mammy’s gwine to be so s’prised she’ll want
to knock me down. En I’s gwine to look solemn
en mousterious en hand her de basket en say,
‘’Tain’t no use er yo’ settin’ dese yer aigs,
Mammy Dilsey, for dey’s already done en
hatched out!’ I know now jes’ what she’s gwine
answer back. She gwine say, ‘Don’t you come
hyer wid none 0’ vo’ projickin’, you pizen-fry-
in’-size-limb-er-Satan, you. Ef you does Ill
smack you slab-sided into de middle of next
winter! Den I gwine say, ‘Well, look for vo’-
se’f, Mammy Dilsey,’ ”
