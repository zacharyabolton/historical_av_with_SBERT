Thus the simple-hearted, modest, unassuming
old man sat with his long fig-stem Powhatan
clay pipe in his mouth, smoking and talking and
making history for a little child who never for-
got the stories he told. Judge Mason was given
all the honors of his State—ten years a Mem-
ber of the Virginia Assembly, six years her
Representative in Congress, a Judge of the
United States Court for Virginia, Secretary of
the Navy under President Tyler, Attorney-Gen-
eral and Secretary of the Navy under President
Polk, Minister to France in the Pierce admin-
istration, one of the three who drew up the
Ostend Manifesto—all these he was to the
world.
To me he has always remained the gentle-
mannered man with sweet face and soft voice
who told the old-time stories in my plantation
home while all, from the master to the humblest
servant and the smallest child, listened with
eager attention and delighted hearts. Two
years before the opening of the war between
the States my grandmother’s heart was sad-
dened by the news from Paris of the death of
this old friend.
