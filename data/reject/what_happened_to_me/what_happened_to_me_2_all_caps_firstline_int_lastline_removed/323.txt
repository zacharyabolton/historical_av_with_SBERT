UNCLE TOM
NE evening just after the New York
steamer had blown her three whistles
in honor of my Soldier, as the river
steamers always did in passing our wharf, and
had gone around the bend, we saw Uncle Tom,
the faithful old negro fisherman, coming up
the hill with a bag over his stooping shoul-
ders and talking to himself more excitedly than
usual,
“Good evening, Uncle Tom,” I said, stepping
off the porch to greet him. “What have you in
your bag for me?”
“Tarepins—dat’s what I got fer you, but I
got a piece of my mind fer Marse George, en ez
dis piece of mind mought not agree wid your
temperation I reckon you better g’long in de
house en sing some of dem song chunes while I’s
mekin’ a present of de piece of mind to Marse
George.”
As my curiosity was greater than my fear
