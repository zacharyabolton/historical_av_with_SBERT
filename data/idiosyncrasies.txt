G. Pickett
  Many pages end in the form `j<int>`, `J<int>`, `IT<int>`.
  Robert E Lee has many embedded letters.
  Most letters are dated. E.g. `Richmond, Jan. 2$, 1S65. .`
  Pickett almost always signs off with `Your Soldier`, `Faithfully your 
  Soldier`, `Your Devoted Soldier`
  Many lines are just strings of special characters.
  Many letters begin with a 'setting' line, e.g. `In the Dark Days Before the 
  End` , `In Which Are Given Certain Important Details of the Battle of Seven 
  Pines` or `Written in Defeat, After the Battle of Five Forks`
  some pages are explicitly marked: E.g. ` â€” Page 12^`
  It seems OCR recognized the `^` as a `^` character, but it is actually a 
  superscript. Occasionally these characters were accompanied by a footnote. 
  E.g.
    "
    1 Grant's surgeon.
    2 Grant's quartermaster.
    "

The Bugles of Gettysburg is unclear about authorship. LaSalle, letters from 
Pickett, or letters to and from cousins Kate and some name yet to be determined 
soldier.

L. Pickett
  Many first lines (even after the first line all camps remover routine had been 
  run) were clearly titles. OCR had mangled them, but due to their similarity 
  and repetition, they were easy to identify and remove.
