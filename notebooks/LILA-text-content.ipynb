And are in camp by the road side. I am hardly able to march but I hate to be absent at such a time and do not wish to go to the Hospital, so I will struggle on - hoping the neuralgia will leave me tomorrow - I will sleep in a house to night. The Whole Army is in motion and the great battle will soon begin. There are  notes  which I will  down as I can and send you for a letter. Good night -  Thursday-- I have had a bad day. My love-- Such a terrible pain in my eye. We moved about fifteen miles closer down ... battle had commenced on our left with Ewells Corps. His firing was terrific but  Stuart told me a while ago that the old wooden leg soldier with his veterans whipped the 4th Yankee Corps badly - Capturing 2000 prisoners and 4  -- our loss heavy. Genl. Jones (from Charlottesville) and Genl. Stafford killed. Also poor William Randolph was    of the 2nd Va. The Regt.  to lose its commanding officers. Randolph was just wounded last week. I saw him & his wife at John Ballords. They were in fine spirits. He remarked that he thought bad luck had run with the regt. long enough. He thought it would change and he escape. God, not luck, [unclear: disposer] of our lives. And he  poor fellow - has fallen another martyr to Southern liberty and his young wife, so bright and happy a few days ago, is today a widow and her unborn baby fatherless. Oh the dreary  hearts that this day has made, and the blacker day   tomorrow! I feel sad and [unclear: wretched] over it all.

This is a dreary  country. Most [unclear: fifty]  sickness for many miles, not a house and not an open field. Nothing but a wilderness of trees and underbrush and marsh and perfectly flat. We are in a small field by the road side about 2 miles from the city of Battle - And here are Genl. Lee and Genl Stuart\\'s Hqrs -- and an  infinity  of wagons and artillery. But I must try to get a place to sleep. I am taking Quinine hoping to drive off Neuralgia tomorrow. Have seen Jim today. Adieau -  Friday morning -- What a din. What an uproar! -- the very heavens seem filled with sound. And in the midst of it all I sit by the road side and write to you my dear Thanking God that you do not hear what I hear, nor see what I see this awful day. The battle recommenced about sun-rise and as I write seems to be raging with intense fury. Oh how my heart sickens as I listen and think of the untold misery arising from this bloody day. Have you ever imagined a battle field and its vicinity, the throng of men hurrying to & fro, the trains of wagons and artillery passing and repassing apparently in inextricable Confusion. All is bewildering to the spectator. And yet how strange that one master mind should control all and bring desired results from this Chaos of War. At intervals there is a perfect Calm, and you might imagine all over, when suddenly the whole heavens reverberate with the clamor of the contending hords - Genl. S. has gone off in fine spirits to lead his Cavalry. May God protect him this day is my earnest prayer - It is now 8 o\\'clock and the last report from Genl. Lee was that he was driving the enemy back handsomely. This seems  from this sound. The firing having ceased in the centre - but Ewell is still keeping it up on the left. Longstreet came up this morning. I think we will whip them and be able to tell you tonight. My head is much easier today but I feel weak. Jim took breakfast with us. He managed to have something cooked even on the [unclear: verge] of the battle field at 5 o\\'clock. So far as heard from we have been successful in the day\\'s fight - And the Yankees are falling back. The fighting has not been as continuous as I expected this morning. No artillery hardly can be used - But my impression is that the fight will be renewed tomorrow - in fact is not over for today -- firing is still going on. I am sorry to tell you Genl. Longstreet was wounded in the shoulder to day - they say by our own men. His wound is not considered dangerous. Genl. Jenkins was killed today and Col. J. Thompson Brown was.

I have been very unwell for several days. A cold was so cruel as to catch me by stratagem or I caught it, one or the other of the ways. I am almost speechless, a certain young lady manifested a great deal of sympathy for me, sent me a very nice apple &c. You made inquiry as to how I enjoyed myself Holidays. In reply, I had a [unclear: soster ] of a time. I was in need of exercise, corporeal exercise especially. You seemed to be very much grieved because I did not come to see you, when I was so close, & used such an expression, that I had forsaken you, so true a friend. But I can reply for your consolation, that I have not forgotten nor forsaken you, though you think my actions may be that way in their tendency. Oh! no, it could not be possible. I cannot be very punctual in my correspondence, because I have a great many letters to write, & College duties are getting more burdensome. Our examinations have been going on for A about 3 or 4 week; had it not been for them I certainly would have responded sooner than now.

I think I could harly let my tongue use such language, though it get deceives me sometimes, what is Lucian doing anyhow? I heard that Astidore was very sick. I hope he will recover. You spoke of something about war I think there can hardly be any such in this Christian land, I can hardly believe that the cup of her iniquity is yet full, & this require many years, as we are taught in the Bible. You spoke of getting a Christmas gift a \"gold heart.\" If you have mine I hope it is not quite so hard as that gold one. Well I must close stop until Society closes.

I begged to be let off, but no excuse would be taken & I was compelled to consent to do so. I enclose you a copy of what I wrote. It was a difficult thing to prepare anything that would be just to Genl Lee's memory and yet not offend these people. I am told I have succeeded.

The Freedmen are generally at work, at an average rate of wages of ($10) ten dollars per month and board for males and ($5) five dollars and board for Females. There are but comparatively a few cases of extreme destitution among them. them, and these are generally confined to the Aged, Sick and Crippled, and those who have very large families of small children. About fifty person have been assisted, by the gratuituous distribution of Clothing, during the month sent here by the Pa. F. Union Com. There is a general complaint among them that they cannot collect their wages when due which of course is a great disadvantage to them, and the only assistance which can be rendered them by the Bureau  Agt.  is to draw off their Bills, and put them in the hands of an Officer for collection. And this often results in judgement being defered from one Court to another until their patience becomes exhausted, and perhaps their families suffer for bread. There is considerable suffering among the Sick, for want of proper medical attendance, and I would earnestly recommend the employment (by the Bureau) of one of the local Physicians, to attend to such as are unable, on account of extreme destitution, to pay a Physician. Am of the opinion that one could be employed at a salary of ($25) twenty-five dollars per month, who would attend to all such cases, and to this point I would respectfully invite your special attention.',\n",

Your father mentioned the stringency of money matters with him--and did not see [unclear: well here] he was to do it. I then proposed to advance $250 and that he should advance a like sum.

In anticipation of this and in view of the abundance and cheapness of vegetables and believing also that it is the duty of the prosperous to aid the needy of their own race I have not made any requisition fo Rations for issue in July believing that none will suffer. I shall observe closely, and if I find any cases where want exists and the full relief of which does not legitimately belong to the local authorities I shall promptly report the same to the S.A. Comr of the District and request needed supplies. This office is still sought by a large number of Freedmen who have been [unclear: overreached] or cheated in settlements for labor performed. As to these cases I repeat my former report that parties, as a rule, are ready to comply with every requirement of the Bureau and make fair settlements. The really important settlements will however as usual occur when those working on shares have an accounting for supplies furnished to them during the working of the crop and which supplies are chargeable against the crop returns. I heard less of threats against Freedmen in case they vote \"Radical\" as it is termed. I do not attribute this to change of sentiment on the part of the citizens, but the labor of the Freedmen is not absolutely necessary to the farmers and they think more of the present benefit of freedmen than the prospective danger of a Radical majority. The meetings which have been held at several places in Augusta Co. have been attended by a respectable \"outside\" sprinkling of whites and no interruption has anywhere occurred. The Freedmen are moderate in their ideas but to a man insist upon such legislation as will secure them present rights in the time to come. In Highland Co. the Freedmen are few and will not take any steps towards organization or public assertion of their rights, and from the character and expression of the citizens as seen & heard by my at Court held at Monterey, they could gain nothing by any association. The Freedmen left in that County are however generally well treated now as the citizens find they leave at once if any undue pressure is bought to bear against them. In both counties I have labored personally to instruct them in their rights by meetings (public) in the evenings so as not to interfere with work on the farms and I am encouraged to think that my endeavors have benefitted both colored & White and that a better feeling between the two classes is the result of the explanations made.',\n",

I have weighed the matter carefully and with a view to strict justice in the case, and come to the conclusion that in consideration of my having been to between three and four hundred dollars expense to furnish a House for, the Teachers that twenty (20) dollars per month you paying House rent furnishing fuel and paying the hire of one servant at eight (8) dollars per month is as low as I can afford to board them. But in consideration of the fact that Staunton must necessarily be a place where all your Teachers must stop over Night and frequently larger as the Stage does not run only alternate days to some points at which you have schools, I will take care of them while here without any extra charge. I have already accommodated the Rev. Mr Mclean in this manner twice, once from Saturday until Monday and once with Supper lodging and Breakfast and Mr Hammond from Saturday until Monday night, and Mr Johnston from Saturday until Monday, also the Misses Shearman and [unclear: Burt] from Monday night until Wednesday, and will continue to do so with all others that you may forward on this way to and from their places of destination Homeward.

I was unable to get possession of the whole of it without turning the people into the Street in cold weather, which of course I could not do, neither would you have me if I could, and I have not been able to collect but sixteen dollars ($16) rent from them on their half of it. But I was obliged to become responsible for the rent of the whole House or not get any of it. I have paid one quarters rent on it which amounted to fifty-six dollars and seventy five cts ($56.75). Deducting the sixteen dollars ($16) leaves your Bill for rent of School House forty dollars and seventy five cts ($40.75) Should I receive the balance due from the colored people which I am in hopes to do I will put it down to your Credit. We commenced to occupy the Building the 15th of November hence the quarter will be up the 15th of Feb. and I am in hopes by that time you will get rid of paying School House rent, as the Colored people have bought a building for a Church and I am aiding them every way in my power by turning over to them Govt. lumber and otherwise to fit it up with the understanding that we shall have the use of it for our Schools when it is completed. I am paying two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) House rent per Annum for Teachers, and have paid it from the 1st of Oct/65. to the 1st of March/66 which amounts to One hundred and four dollars and fifteen cts ($104.15). But I will give you these figures in connection with other items in the enclosed Bill, and close this letter by saying that I have endeavored at all times to manage your affairs as if they had been my own, always keeping in view the noble work in which you are engaged and the fact that you depend upon the Charity of the public to defray the expense of it, We feel very proud of our Schools here in Staunton and do not consider consider them second to any in the State and nothing would give us more pleasure than to have you, or any, or all of the Officers of the A.

Have Augusta & Fanny given up their wicked & unbecoming snarling at each other? Frequently when I awake in the night I think of them, & their want of that mutual kindness & affection in deportment, it distresses me greatly--It would delight you to see how affectionate cousin Elvira's children are to each other, & how respectful to their mother. Is Mary learning her lessons well now? Cousin Elly's boy who is but little older reads very well. She must spur up or she will be considered very dull if not a dunce--This would distress me exceedingly--If she could not learn I would not think much of it--But as I know she can if she will, I will take it very hard if she does not. When I get away from home, & have time for reflection, I think a great deal about the children, & am exceedingly anxious that they should try and qualify themselves to take a respectable position in the world--They have great advantages & opportunities for improvement, & if they neglect them, they will repent it when they get old enough to realize the importance of them--I fear for example that Baldwin cares a great deal more about a becoming coat than becoming deportment--And I know he feels a great deal more anxiety to do what Tom Kinney & some of idle boys think right, than what his father and mother know to be proper--May God bless them all! & you too my dearest wife in the constant prayer of your affectionate husband.\",\n",

       " 'p009_031': 'I have been intending for a long time to write to you, but having a very large family to look to, and the cares of \"public life\" too, I have found it difficult hitherto to do so. You and Aunt Sally have no doubt heard about that large boy of mine in Albemarle. Mrs Randolph says that he is a real monster, but I have neve seen him, and only know him as just by reputation. I shall take more interest in \"little folks\" now than ever, and after the war will add a \"Blue Beard\" to my library. My wife is well and writes to me every two or three days. She and the rest of the family have been somewhat disturbed about about Lewis Randolph-my brother-in-law-who was at Roanoake Island and was taken prisoner. They have heard however within the last few days that he was not wounded, and was upon the Ocean in a Yankee vessel destined probably for Fort Monroe or some more northern point. He was First Lieut. in a company from Albemarle commanded by Capt Robert Coles. The latter was killed. He was a very promising & fine young man, and was engaged to a daughter of Dr Fairfax, formerly of Alexandria & now of Richmond. He was engaged only two days before he left Richmond, and has left his intended all he had. His loss is the more to be regretted since he is the only child of Gov? Edward Coles of Philadelphia who was partial enough to the \"Old Dominion\" to live in it. The loss of Roanoake Island, Port Royal, Hatteras, Rich Mountain, Forts Henry & Donelson are as unaccountable to me as the singular manner in which Virginia\\'s favorite General-Robert Lee has been kept in the back-ground, and obscure men put forward. Our convention with a unanimity as unparalleled, as that manifested in the Congress that selected Genl Washington, singled out Genl Lee as if by a presentment of his fitness to lead our Armies. Genl Scott was dismayed at it, and yet this chosen leader and favorate of his state, owner of Arlington Heights, and acquainted with every foot of the District of Columbia was kept merely to organize the Army, and then to [unclear: keep] up Wise Floyd & H.R. Jackson, and then to stay the consequences of the disaster at Port Royal, whilst Beauregard from the swamps of Louisana, was sent to operate against the enemy on the Potomac, & Wise from the beach of the Ocean to manage the Mountain country, with that little Georgia [unclear: Fernin]-Jackson to man a line of mountain defence that honest [unclear: farmer] from the low-lands too could not help from being broken, and we have had old \"stone wall Jackson\"- a native of Harrison County-exasperated to the point of resigning because he could not be allowed to operate as he believed he could most effectually in a region so familiar to him. There is something about all of these things that is as I have said unaccountable to me. I thinkthat there has been mismanagement somewhere, but of course this is just between you & me. It will not do to express such opinions except to you, or my father, and knowing you to be a great thinker I thought that I would just feel your thoughts about these things to see if mine cannot be bettered by it. I have not felt dispirited by the news from Tennessee. I think that the losses we have sustained there & at Roanoake and Port Royal are mainly attributable to the advantages the Yankees have over us on the water. When we get them out on the land we can whip them. I am glad that our Legislature has at last had the good sense to adopt your suggestion about increasing the number of privates in our Companies to a hundred. I saw an extract from a letter of yours to a member of the Legislature, copied in the Whig a few weeks ago, and the plan you propsed met with universal [unclear: affectation] out here. It ought to have been adopted at the beginning of the War, and the Volunteers ought to have been received only for the War. We will now have only confusion and delay in bracing up, when this would have been unnecessary if we had started right. There are many who will reenlist for the war & many who will have to be forced to go- all this from our morocratic plan- everybody institutions, the prostitution of the ballot box, and the \"liberty, equality and fraternity\" feeling that has been pervading all classes in this county untilthe government has gone to decay, and our new one is contending against the evil effects of bad associations For my part I prefer the excesses of power to the excesses of liberty, and when the war is over I hope we will have a government that will stand the test of time, and keep the rabble quiet. The worst population we have in Va is over here. The journey men stay at home, sell whisky to the soldiers, trade horses and groan and complain at their bad lot whenever any service is required of the militia. The best ladies-or rather women for there are no ladies here-work, milk the cows, set the table, and sweep their houses when their husbands are worth a hundred thousand sometimes & the little negro chaps are petted and taken care of in the house with the whites. Indeed the Negroes are as good here as their masters & often more polite and refined. The idea of such people having anything to say in government. It would ruin any country. A good many of the refugees that come over the mountains have come to keep from being drafted in the northern Army, and they ought now to be taken & put in the front rank at Manassa, for volunteering on our side is the last thing that many of them want to do. They would rather trade in horses and whiskey. I have been emptying their whiskey barrels for five miles around & shall keep it up. I just send out one officer & men to search houses & destroy all that they find. Some of these rascals have been selling to my men at $27 per gallon & [unclear: meare ] whiskey and [unclear: dranking ] at that. They have been getting quite uneasy since I commenced the war upon them, and I shall put this rascally extortion & illegal trafic down if I have to break some of their necks. We are in Winter Quarters in a rich little valley called Crab bottom where the head waters of James River & the Potomac begin, our stream flows south & the other north and the fountain heads are only a few miles apart The proprieters are all grasers, and I learn that they easily make from ten to fifteen per cent on their Capital invested in land and stock clear of all expenses. It would be an interesting occupation amongst a different people. Maple sugar and Maple syrup are both made to a considerable extent here, and I have some every day on my table together with fine milk & butter, and then we have rice & coffee &c & live well enough. Our Cabins are all very plain but very comfortable and Old Scott-just like an Old Batcheler- has provided himself with sheets pillows & pillow cases and when he went to Powhatan left them in my charge together with his straw mattress so I am getting on very well with a good bed, Candles, towels, tin basin & a plenty to eat and a little indifferent whiskey which you know I only take occasionally. Col. Scott is still sick in Powhatan & will hardly be back I expect before the first of April. We will all have to come before the company officers in [unclear: time] for reelection I expect of course to continue in the field, and expect to be elected without any difficulty. Most of the regimt will reenlist I expect, and many are ready to do so now The law as regards exempts does not exempt overseers if I remember aught. for I saw the bill hastily. This will put me to great inconvenience & many others, but we will have to make a great struggle in the spring & I shall not grumble. I expect that the war will probably be over by midsummer, unless the English & French continue their heartless course of indifference towards us, and even without aid we may break down our enemies. Their funds must give out. I hope that all of our friends who can will save their tobacco until after the war for it must bring enormous prices. Everything seems to be getting high. An ordinary horse-a common plough-horse- will bring even [unclear: hire] a hundred and fifty dollars, and if the government continues to impress the teams of the farmers they will be be higher after the war than they are now. Our Genl Johnson is in Richmond on a short Furlough & Col. John Baldwin is in command on the Mountain. There are about three thousand troops out here in all, as much as is necessary now & as many as can be supplied at this time. You must give my love to Aunt Sally all the Children and all others at Saratoga & Mill-brook, and I would be glad to hear from you as soon as you can convieniently write-just mention the name of the Regt-44th Va [unclear: Vol ] care of Majr J.

You may depend upon it General that the Quarter Masters Department in the North West never can be managed with system & regularity until first rate business & experienced men are commissioned & placed at the important points on the line, & when commissioning they give security. Money can be drawn by them & many supplies purchased. Whereas when men are only occupying the place of assistants they are powerless & they probably never see their principal once in two months. Unless this Department is thoroughly organized on the different lines the Army must suffer greatly in the coming winter. You can judge of it by what your division has already suffered. I know you have enough to do without attending to these details. I expect to join my regiment in 8 or 10 days & hope to get the Department in working order in your line before I left. I hope you will write a letter to the Secretary of War on the subject. I have placed Capt. Funkhouser on the road in charge of the Pony Express line & Capt Mason in charge of the repairs to the road, and a good business man is needed in the Quarter Masters Dept at Monterey whose duty should be to purchase all the supplies of forage &c & also see to the proper management of the wagons, horses &c, and also to have repair shops, blacksmith & wood shops at that point. I have written  my views & I recd. a letter from General Lee yesterday which I enclosed to the Secretary of War stating the great difficulty about transportation on that line.

I got a furlough of 25 days the middle of December, and came home and was constantly busy to provide for the wants of my family for the coming year, intending to go back to your house, but the very day I got back to camp I was ordered to the Valley for duty, and have my headquarters now in Staunton, though I shall spend most of my time in the mountains.  But, oh my Brother, I have sad news to tell you, our sister Jenny is dead. She died after the birth of a child that died also; thus we depart, one by one,- how sad the condition of our poor parents, now living at the old home, by the bridge, to have one by one those that have been their solace and support taken from them. Would God that we might be near to comfort them in their declining years. It is a heavy blow, for Jenny was truly their only remaining daughter. Heaven help them in their deep affliction.  Nancy McKune wrote to Sara, by flag of truce, and the letter came yesterday. She did not say when Jenny died. Her daughter, Viola, is married to a gentm. at Port Jervis. Mrs. Comfort is very well. She says everything is [unclear: tight] and people have hard times to get along.  I come out last night, go away in the morning. I have an office in Staunton; Breeze Johnson's old office.

I do not see that I can get the potatoes you bought for me, so you had better dispose of them as best you can, unless you can send us some to Staunton. It costs us a great deal to live now, the currency has depreciated so much. I only look forward to the day when it shall become worthless, then there will be an improvement. Independence must come before long in spite of any impediments in currency, etc We must expect hard times, but we must learn to endure them. My neighbors kindly sold me provisions at government prices, or I should not have been able to support my family. We have 9 pigs, quite a windfull at such times as these. Sara has been quite sick, had something like quinzy. She is not better. I sold the animal I wanted you to keep to E. Geeing and bought another of Liehliter. Richard comes to us the 15th of April. I shall feel much easier then, having some trusty one here. I got a girl of Col Sterrett for Sara for $60. I hired William again for $300. Cy. wants you, if you come over, to bring his things. He lives with Mr. Baylor, I think. Did you succeed in paying up your hire? I shall try to come by your house when I return to the army if I can. I want to see you all very much.

       " 'p025_049': 'I have the honor to submit the following report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub-Dist for the Month ending October 31st 1866. The freedmen are very quiet seeming to feel that it is the better for them to submit to small inconveniences in order to live peaceably with their white employers - The number of idlers is largely on the increase the working season being nearly at an end; the majority of those who worked by the day must now be unemployed or work for their board during the coming winter. Many families throughout the Counties are now working on the same basis as before their freedom, this will if continued soon bring a large class of them completely dependent upon the will of the whites. This state of affairs is attributable in some degree to the manner in which Slaves were treated here - it seems never to have been the practice to exact the hard labor from them in this portion of the State, exacted through most of the South the consequence is that as a class their labor is not as valuable The fact that there is a great scarcity of money is another cause. The whites claim to be unable to pay high wages, actual monied transactions in everyday business dealings are rare and the enormous rates of interest which money commands would seem to justify a belief in their plea of lack of money. If whites in business transactions cannot trust each other how can it be expected that justice will be done the ignorant freedpeople. The marriage register of the County of Augusta shows more than an average of three children to each married couple. Many of these children are grown, still the system of sale so lately in vogue has left a large proportion of small ones for which the freedpeople are obliged to provide hence the services of the Mother are generally obtained for her board and perhaps a few articles of clothing, or if the family has more than its proportion of children the Mother must have a house to live in and the family be chiefly subsisted by the Father who if a first class hand may obtain from 8 to ten dollars per month for his services with the understanding that the employer shall furnish him with subsistance for his family at Store rates - the amount considered and the prices charged are sometimes curious, and of course indisputable proofs of what can be made way with in a small family. The effect in most instances is to leave the freedman little or nothing to look upon as saved at the end of a year of labor, indeed he may be thankful if he is not in debt. I make the above statement to show the system of labor in this County. I fear the result will be to leave a large class in very destitute circumstances this winter. The system of County taxation seems very [unclear: unjust] the County taxes in this Sub-Dist are altogether poll tax amounting in Augusta Co to three (3) dollars each this bears as heavy upon a poor man as upon a man of property, it is an outside matter but has its effect many of the freedmen call upon me to see about the payment of tax; they seem to think it unjust to pay so much, and many of them have ideas about voting in connection with paying tax, which in time will lead them to demand good reasons for doing one and not the other. It seems to have touched them in a sensitive spot when called upon to pay. The course of politics North is closely watched by them, in this town they are remarkably well posted and I have found that news of that kind spreads through the County very quickly. I am acquainted with one colored man who takes the \"Washington Chronicle\" and regularly imparts the news to his Color. The freedmen are laboring under many disadvantages now which will require time at least to remove. The prejudice of the white man against allowing any rivalry by the black man must be conquered before the latter can become in the full sense of the word, free.',\n",

At the time I wrote the battle was raging. And as soon as it was finished I rode along the lines to ascertain how this day was going. The firing was incessant and grand. By the time I reached our left where Jackson was engaged, the enemy were repulsed and driven with great loss into Fredericksburg and under cover of his heavy batteries over the opposite side of the river. I spent the night with Bud James. The next day we confidently expected a reversal of this fight. And I again rode along the line of battle. The enemy were drawn up in large forces and in sight; but the severe punishment he had reseived the day before deterred him from pursuing the attack. Thus the two armies remained all day Sunday and Monday. Monday Afternoon the enemy asked permission to bury his dead, which was granted. Monday night he hurriedly and quickly withdrew the slain army across the Rappahannock leaving some 200 or 300 of his dead unburied. Yesterday morning I rode over the battle field and counted in our place fifty five dead bodies, lying dark and cold. And almost naked. A most ghastly experience. They had been carried to some spot for burial, but their inhumane friends had left that duty unperformed and under cover of the truce flag vacated their position - So ends the Battle of Fredericksburg which I suppose Burnside will claim as a great victory. Prisoners said that he ordered a renewal of the attack on Sunday Morning, but could not get his men to come up to the scratch. His Generals remonstrated with him that it was impossible to carry our position. And then the On to Richmond is again delayed. Last evening Jackson's Corps moved towards Port Royal. And one now believes that place and Fredericksburg shows what the enemy are about. I have not heard. -- Changing his base I suppose.  It is bitter cold to night, but very comfortable in our tent.

       " 'p040_027': 'I write to you for counsel for do not know exactly what to say.  The suspicions that my assistant was not well adapted to this place are much deepened by her trial of the work; under my observation. As the colored people wanted me to take an assistant teacher, from their own color, and as the plan would pacify them (and amid their divisions this seems necessary) therefore I wanted a teach that I could trust with a part of my school, while I took another part, and gave a colored teacher the surplus The part that I gave to my white assistant I wanted send into another room and give her full charge of them. I shall be likely to have 150 scholars as I now have 110 and this number will warrant this arrangement or even 130 would. Now this teacher can not teach Long division--and yesterday morning I even showed her Short division--indeed I have children in this school not more than 12 yrs old who are father advanced than is this teacher. She is not more competent than several colored teachers. She dares not ask questions in grammar, and is obliged to review her Intermediate geography. Beside this,--she is entirely inexperienced and lacks mental discipline which some teachers have outside of school books,-- by reading etc. Nevertheless she seems to be a christian and of excellent spirit. She is also a dress-maker and a milliner by trade. She can not teach times; much less the  of music She is desirous of improving herself You will see therefore that while the school needs one competent teacher beside myself;-- beside such assistance as I could get from colored help.--that it has only such help as is equal to an incompetent colored teacher or one who can only take charge of the very primary classes If I had an educated teacher I could let this teacher come in as second; but then too if I had an educated teacher--(at least thro\\' Long division)-- a colored assistant could fill the place--which this teacher would naturally fall into--or necessarily take. Now the school needs separating but as I said before I hardly dare send her into a room by herself, and certainly not with all the classes which I could give a more educated teacher Now I can teach this teacher Long Division etc. but then one who is only just able to creep thro a subject herself is not fitted to carry these poor undisciplined people through the difficulties that beset the path of childhood, and ignorance. I am therefore teaching a school so large that I must do either injustice to the children, or send some away, or soon break down myself--with this apprentice as my only help. In a large graded school there would be more, purely primary scholars, and this lady could work there with more success--or even where no school had been before organized (tho I dont think she would do well at building up a place alone) She would also be excellent in an industrial school--tho\\' she wouldn\\'t like it perhaps fully as well. These are the facts--and while in nine cases out of ten I should not be so likely to get another teacher of such excellent spirit, as this lady (yet I might, and should hope to do so,) still something more is needed here, it seems to me. I can assure you that those excellent ladies of Beaufort,--(the graduates of Holyoke etc) are now often thought of as I remember last year; and found the principle well established that it requires a knowledge of higher branches as an aid in the art of teaching the lower--at least such information is of use, how much more then, a knowledge of Long Division I have just learned that there are two or three class of perhaps a doz. each in the outskirts of the city which want to be taught if any could come out to do it but now we can not go with this large number in our regular school. I am now all the while afraid that a knowledge of the inability of this teacher will leak out--among the colored people,--that some scholars will greatly embarrass her and the fact will come out; which will injure the school and give to those petty teachers about town, a chance to talk of her inability and to boast of their own ability. I have told this lady that I did not think she was the person--exactly, that was needed here. She was not the least offended, but remarked She \"was afraid not\" but she would rather like to remain, tho\\' would I think be willing to go to another field. (I think this letter will bear reading twice) but I have set before you the facts to the best of my ability and have done it thus early that if you choose to send another teacher or make changes it may be done during the Christmass Vacation (if we have any) or before the first of January 1869--as many more scholars are then coming. There occurs to me two advantages in sending this teacher away if you send me one competent. 1st When the warm weather comes the school will be likely to fall off--that is in April--so that two of us could make it successful and then if I had a colored monitor just to hear the very primary classes, thro\\' the winter--I should not be compelled to keep her a moment longer than she was needed thus save expense; and please the people at the same time who want a colored teacher. This could probably be done without injury to the work of education, if one competent teacher was here to help me. Another advantage would be in the example to the colored people. Dr  says that it took the world 4000 years to learn correctly the idea of God; and it sometimes costs communities a good deal of training to learn some one idea, and is often worth all it costs To remove this teacher on the ground of inability would teach these people that it is the belief of the Great American Missionary Association that uneducated teachers are not fit to do so grand a work as many here suppose themselves capable of doing This is a most important lesson--for even the ignorant minister here,--said, to his people\" just befor I came, --\"We are now a free people and therefore ought to depend on ourselves\"--meaning in the connection in which he put it that they were able to act as their own educators The spirits and intentions of this woman seem excellent, but she is not very well qualified in my opinion to do general missionary work, as she is passive and confiding in her nature--rather than cautiously and wisely aggressive and endowed with christian dignity and humble energy. One must have the grace of being able to \"go out into the highways and compelling them to come in\"--to do much with these poor dormant people.--After all she will not be useless here if she remains, but I want you to understand the situation of things. I am getting to weary for the beginning of a term. My books are not yet here!! There is a Miss Hine in Middlebury who has been out once under the (Vesey St.) Freedmens Union Commsson. She wants to come south. I think. And I don\\'t believe she has yet come. She wanted to go to Virginia. She is a christian and will answer the necessities of this place. I had thought of asking you to send for her at first but did not know but you might send me even a better than she. I think the church might pay partly for her support. I have enclosed two letters to which you can add what you choose, seal and send on if best or do otherwise or better if you can I leave it with you.

       " 'p002_007': 'I have the honor to submit the following Report of Bureau affairs in this Sub. Dist. Since I made my last Report the troops have all been withdrawn from this Sub. Dist., thereby giving us the oportunity to make the experiment as to whether the operation of the Bureau could be successfully carried on without them, or not, and I am free to say that the Civil Authorities thus far have done everything in their power to prevent the interruption of our schools or the operations of the Bureau. Yet I am not prepared to say by this that no troops are needed but I believe a very small number, for the purpose of making arrests, when necessary, would insure the complete success of the Bureau in its operations. It sometimes happens, and there are several cases of the kind on hand now, that men refuse to appear here when summoned, that they refuse to come, and treat the summons with contempt. There is also occasionally a case in which persons refuse to comply with decisions of the Court, and in such cases as these I am completely powerless with any troops. One case in particular which I desire to call your attention to is that of E.P. Walton, who was tried by the Court for a violation of Contract which he acknowledges to have been made with a freedman, and by which he brought complainant from Kentucky during the war under the promise of returning her to her parents whenever she desired it. The Court heard all the testimony in, and carefully weighed the case, and unanimously rendered the following verdict: Said Walton to be allowed thirty Days in which to furnish necessary funds to defray the womans expenses back to her parents. The time expired on the 15th of January, 1866, and he has failed to comply, or give any explanation why. Now, unless the decisions of the Court can be enforced it is all a farce, and might as well be discontinued. What I would reccommend in the case is this: That you immediately write to Richmond giving a statement of the facts, and request a guard to be sent here at once to arrest said Walton and take him to Richmond and compel him to comply with the decision of the Court. Our Court here is composed of myself and two as respectable Citizens as there is in town. One of them is a middle aged man, the other an aged man and neither of them disposed to do any injustice to their fellow citizens, and there was no disagreement in their opinions in the decision of this case, and they, like myself, feel that it should be enforced at once. The freedmen, generally speaking, behave well and are entering into Contracts by the year with monthly payments; true that few of the Contracts are made at this office, but I am inclined to think that this is owing to the Charge that is made for them here and the prejudice of the Whites to coming here. Many of them, however, make their own contracts and bring them here for approval, which I do, if properly made, without any charge. Our schools here are in a very flourishing condition, and, we think, second to none in the state. This, I think, is owing to the efficiency of the teachers, and to them the credit belongs, and I think we are all gaining ground every Day in the estimation of the respectable citizens of the place. I had a long conversation yesterday with the Editor of the \"Valley Virginian\" who has been continually throwing flings, through the Columns of his paper, at the Bureau, in which I told him that I had never seen any thing of the kind in the other papers issued here, and that such flings were calculated to excite the populace against the Bureau, and lead them to some overt acts for which he would be responsible, and he has promised to desist from such communications. If he does not, I shall again call your attention to the subject and reccommend that he be notified by Maj. Gen. Terry that such things will not be allowed. This, I think, is due to the better portion of the Citizens here, and I have no doubt they would be glad to have it done. With reference to Highland County, I cannot say anything which would be based upon actual knowledge, but as the number of colored people there is very small indeed, and as I have heard no reports to the contrary, I am inclined to think that matters are moving along quietly there. No rations have been issued this month, neither have we had any enlisted men detailed to this office; consequently there is no report to make upon either of these subjects.

But Chum is in Page and I have no correspondent in Augusta to give me news from you; emboldened therefore by having heard you say; first; that when you received a letter from a friend you always answered it, and secondly that you considered me one of your friends, which two propositions combined in the form of a sylogism necessitate the conclusion that you would answer my letter. I have concluded to write, and trust to this very indirect promise. I think the conclusion which I have drawn is clearly demonstrable by any rules of logic from Aristotle to Whateley and hope you will not violate even this indirect promise. I think I heard you say some time ago that you agreed with me in thinking the prevalent prejudice against ladies and gentlemen corresponding with each other, both unreasonable and injurious; and that it was the part of wisdom to disregard it. I hope therefore that although I am asking a great favour of you you will not consider it too great a one to devote an hour occasionally to writing a letter to me. I own it is hardly fair, for you will have usually have long boring letters to read without either correction or order in the arrangement, while I cannot fail to be very much improved as well as interested by corresponding with one who has gained so young, a litterary reputation. I had the pleasure of meeting you cousins in Leuray and spent an hour or two very pleasantly in their company. In Rappahannock I called on a gentleman whom I had met only once before with the intention of staying all night but he insisted so on my remaining longer that I found it impossible to escape for nearly three days. H. B. He had a very pleasant daughter. I stopped then a day in Warrenton and saw two of my lady friends from Washington, both very strong southerners, and several gentlemen in the army from Alexandria with whom I was acquainted. Of course the time passed pleasantly and I was sorry that as my visit had already been protracted two weeks beyond my first calculation, duty bade me hurry on. I arrived at home on Wednesday about noon much to the joy of Pa & Ma and myself too in fact, for I had been away so long that I was beginning to wish for the quiet pleasures of home once more. Day before yesterday I went to Leesburg to get me a copy of Gilhams tactics but could not find one in the place and heard a gentleman say that he bought a week ago the last copy in Richmond so I sent by a friend of mine who is smuggling military stores from Baltimore for the south. I hope the abolitionists will not catch him and I will have my Gilham by next Thursday previous to that time I shall prosecute as fast as possible the study of Hardee which I shall commence to-day.

       " 'p021_010': 'The last letter we received from you was written last July, and reached us in September. Since that David & I both have written you, but I think it doubtful whether our letters ever reached you. The last was written the last week in December by David; which I infer never reached you, as Mollie has just received a letter from the Rev. Mr Lockridge, which he commences by saying that he had promised her friends in Chattooga County to write to her. I, hence, infer that he had recently seen her friends. He closes his letter in these words: \"My love to Mr Gilkeson and his aged father if he is still alive.\" Now, my Dear Brother, if that last letter of Davids had reached you it is not probable Mr Lockridge would have closed his letter in those words: for that letter contained the mournful intelligence of the death of our dear father. I will give you the particulars of his death, as this letter will very likely convey to you the first intelligence of this sad event. He died very suddenly on the 23rd of December, and on Christmas day we laid him to rest by the side of our sainted Mother. Truly it was a sad Christmas, and although seven months have elapsed, yet time seems to bring no healing on his wings to me. His health had been quite as good as usual up to within two or three days of his death, & even then he did not complain as much as he often did. Uncle David told me that he thought the last two or three times he saw him he seemed to be more lively & cheerful than he had seen him for a long time. And this was strikingly true, he remarked, the last time he saw him, which was the Monday morning previous to his death. On that morning they met at Wm Guthries on some business; and whilst there a shower of rain came up, and cousin William took off their saddles and laid them in his porch. When they left Father picked up his saddle and put it on his horse, whilst Wm Guthrie put on Uncle David\\'s saddle. When ready to mount, Uncle David lead his horse some distance to a stump to mount from, but Father gathered up his reins, put his foot in the stirrup, and mounted from the ground, and at the same time looked back over his shoulder & remarked in [unclear: his] usual pleasant manner, \"brother David, I have that advantage over you yet, I can still mount from the ground.\" On the day before, he went to church although it was a very rainy, disagreeable day. On Monday night he complained of having caught cold, & continued to complain of not feeling well, although he went about as usual over the farm up to Thursday night. On that night and Friday morning he took medicine. David asked him before breakfast on Friday morning if he should feed his hogs for him; he replied, \"oh no, that he would attend to them after a while\" After breakfast, however, he told David to feed the hogs, as he would not go out there. He went from the dining room into his chamber and amused himself with the children as was his custom. He had the lounge drawn up before the fire on which he reclined a portion of the time during the fournoon. About 12 O\\'Clock he read a chapter or two in the bible verse about with David\\'s oldest child, whom he taught to read and whose  and proficiency pleased him much. Directly afterwards he went into the parlor and in less than half an hour returned to the chamber and took a seat on the lounge and made some inquiries of David, who was present, relative to business. He very soon laid down on the lounge & almost immediately David heard him snore, and said to him, \"are you asleep already, Father\" but receiving no answer went to him, but says that he does not think that he drew a breath after he got to him. Thus, my dear brother, passed away our dear Father. How we should cherish his memory, for I know you will agree with me in saying that not many persons have been blessed with such a Father. He was certainly one of the most perfect models of a man and a christian I ever knew. Enclosed I send you an obituary which appeared in the Central Presbyterian about a month after his death. He made a will in January 1863 in which he left all his property to David & me excepting his Bank stock ($2500) which he left to you; stating that, in his opinion, that amount together with what he had already given you would about make you equal with us. I very much fear, however, that in the present conditions of the banks you will never be able to realize much from it. Mr Stuart has just stepped in, & says that it can never be worth any thing. Will it be possible for you to pay us a visit this fall? Do try to come. We will be so much delighted to see you. It would do my heart good to see you again, after the awful conflict we have passed through. I would enjoy a visit from you now so much more than when you were here before, as I am now keeping house. Do write immediately, and do say you will visit us this fall. My little family are now in pretty good health. My oldest boy Willie is just recovering from a severe attack of dysentery. We thought for several days that we should certainly have lost him, but without a relapse we now think he will get well. He is just beginning to walk. He was six years old in April. We have four very interesting children, two girls & two boys. David and family are all well. We have been very anxious to communicate with you ever since the close of the war, but could not ascertain how we could send a letter in the absence of mail facilities. One of our citizens starts for Georgia tomorrow, and I had made up my mind to write you and enclose the letter in an Envelope directed to [unclear: McClung] of Rome & get this friend of mine to try to convey it to [unclear: McClung]. But on yesterday Mr Lockridge\\'s letter came to hand, and he directs Mollie to [unclear: direct] any letters she may write home to him at [unclear: Ringgold] & he will convey them to their destination. So I have concluded to send this by my friend to convey to Mr Lockridge instead of to Mr [unclear: McClung]. Mr L. does not say whether they have a mail to Ringgold or not, but if there is, then will now certainty of his getting this if mailed in Atlanta or Augusta than if mailed here. Therefore I will give it to my friend to mail in Georgia, or if the mails are not running yet to convey it to Mr L. in some other way. We had not heard a word from you since your letter written in July last until some two or three weeks since David received a letter from James Gamble written in Camp [unclear: Chaser] which gave us news from you as recently as March. And Mr Lockridges letter gives us news from you I suppose up to about the first of this months. \"Much has occurred here\" which will be news to you but I do not know where to begin. I expect you have not heard of Carlisle Gilkeson\\'s death which occurred in August last. Do write immediately and if possible do visit us this fall. I feel so anxiously to see you once more.

We crossed the river near Leesburg after the battles at Manassas & proceeded to Fredrick City in Fredrick County. We captured some few stores, & all the wounded & sick in Hospital, numbering some 500, the most of whom were convalescent, took [unclear: possession] of the Baltimore & Ohio Rail Road & Telegraph wires, destroyed the bridge. here we camped a few days, from thence we marched in the direction of Hagerstown to a little town called Boonsboro here we had a little skirmish with some Yankey Cavalry, which resulted in killing one & capturing one, from thence we marched to Williamsport a little town on the Potomack, where we recrossed the river, from thence to Martinsburg where there were several thousand Yanks (Longstreet & Hill Divisions remaining in Maryland) but before we reached the place they made their escape to Harper Ferry. We remained there a short time, after which we went on towards the Ferry, in the mean time Hills division marched on to the \"Maryland hights,\" &  on the \"Virginia\", Jackson bringing up the rear. When we got about 3 miles of the Ferry, we could see the Yankee tents  on \"Bolivar hights\" - this was on Saturday evening. On Sabath morning our batteries opened on them from the hights, which was responded to by the enemy, but our men having a much higher position rendered their shot inaffective. we were then completely around them with no chance of their making an escape. Old Jack sent in a flag of truce demanding an unconditional surrender they asked till the next day. The firing was kept up all day & on monday morning our batteries opened again having changed their position, it was not long until they hoisted the white flag. Old Jack was soon in their midst, thus ended the scene - about 13,000 prisoners were taken including 1,500 Negroes, 15000 stand of small arms, 50 pieces of artillery, 1500 horses 4 or 500 wagons ambulances & a  We were then marched on to Shepardstown Crossing into Maryland were our forces were attacked by McCleland, Burnside, & in fact the whole of their army from Washington & on the 19th just one of the greatest battles of the war was fought, of which I have no time now to speak, suffice it to say our loss was very heavy, & that of the enemy eqal as heavy if not more so.

We have some teachers who are so accustomed to the climate, that they would stay through the summer and open schools at these places if they could be supported.

The condition of freedpeople is improving slowly it is true, as the large majority of Whites who are employers are in straitened circumstances themselves but surely they are being thrown more and more on their own resources, and are learning the value - here at least - of time and money. The fact that the Freedman is now a citizen is generally recognized and he is spoken of and treated with more consideration. Employment is readily procured on farms, public works and lumbering at fair wages and the large crop of grain and grass which will soon be ready for harvest must place labor at a premium in this Valley. Numerous complaints are made at this office of refusal to pay for labor under old contracts or sharp practice in settlements under them but as a general rule I find the parties willing to settle promptly and justly. Threats of discharge of Freedmen vote contrary to the wishes of employers are very common but I attach but little importance to them for the Freedmen will vote Republican almost to a man and the farmers of the two are the most dependent upon the other as with their large prospective harvest they have the most at stake and they will care less how the Freedman votes than how he works. The feeling between the Freedmen and their [unclear: former] masters is friendly with remarkably few exceptions. The condition of the sick, aged and helpless both old and young has been much improved by the issue of rations received at this Station and I am hopeful that with the incoming of garden vegetables, further assistance from the Bureau will not be necessary as most have small garden or corn patches and these will supply considerable food, while friends will be able to help also. As to Medical attendance I respectfully renew my remark as to the needs of freedpeople in this Division. Dr. S.C. Harris completed this month twelve month gratuitous prescriptions and supply of medicine to the most indigent and afflicted colored people in Staunton. I have been personally cognizant of these services since my assignment to this station and I regret much that Dr. Harris informs me this morning he cannot afford his services and medicine longer, without remuneration sufficient to pay for the latter. I received a copy of Genl. O. O. Howards Cir. Lett. of May 15/67 with reference to establishment of \"Lincoln\" Temperance Associations and the general discouragement of drinking intoxicating liquor and have made a suggestion in accordance therewith to some of the leading colored men in Staunton. If a copy of the constitution and bye laws of the Central Society at Washington can be furnished I have no doubt a branch organization can be established here. I am happy to state that in Augusta & Highland, drunkenness is much more prevalent among White than colored people and quite exceptional among the Whites. Generally the future of the Freedman in my Division is full of promise. The aged and orphans, of whom there are many, must continue dependent upon local or National charity for some years, but the able bodied male and female will shortly be able to take care of themselves, physically and politically.',\n",

I then had the bridge carefully reconnoitered and it was reported that no enemy was to be seen, then I sent 3 men with a captain to burn the bridge and ordered the rest of the men to feed their horses 3/4 of a mile off, the men went forward to burn the bridge and had put hay in the mouth of it and set it on fire, when a column of the enemy appeared and fired a volley and their dragoons charged, a messenger at once reported that they were coming and I ordered the men to their horses and told Jordan to front his men -- and I went forward to reconnoitre, when J. followed me instead of attending to his men, and the enemy came charging up and firing when our men broke at once except some 3 or four, and a perfect stampede of them took place, the enemy pursuing for 3 miles, every attempt to rally was unavailing, some actually throwing away their guns, many their coats, blankets &c &c -- I never saw a more disgraceful affair -- all owing no [unclear: doubt] to the state of intoxication of some of the men, and to the want of discipline -- One of our men was killed, one wounded and we have not found out how many were taken prisoners -- I went on when I found the men could not be rallied, and looked after the party I had left behind and with them brought up the rear -- most of the others having taken to the woods &c--. The enemy now hold the lower bridge, but we have burned the upper. Our escape was providential considering the panic of the men and the rapid retreat over a rough road. I suppose you all thought you were abandoned when you heard that we had left the Valley, but now you see that we saved the Valley by that very movement, for the enemy at once fell back. We shall be reinforced in a day or two I suppose, and a battle will no doubt be fought before many days, and on that may hang the fate of our country, and I do pray that it may be favorable to us. Gen. Ed. Johnson of Alleghany was here last night and went back this morning, so concert of action will be secured by the union of our Generals in council. The weather is still bad -- very bad and the mud deep, making it very disagreeable for our troops. There was some skirmishing at Yorktown a few days ago -- favorable to us, and I suppose the great fight must soon come off -- The varied success of war has been our fate, and I suppose will be, but of our ultimate success there cannot be the shadow of a doubt if our rulers and people do their duty, and I think they will, though we must be tried in the school of adversity before we use our strength as we ought to -- and be -- willing to be disciplined -- Of course it is not my business to tell what I may happen to know is to be done, for such things should not be made known [unclear: I] am somewhat stiff and sore today from my long ride and exposure yesterday, but am perfectly well -- We are quartered in a house, and therefore are secure from inclemency at night. I am sorry, truly sorry, that Jordan was in such a condition yesterday, and I do not know what may come of it to him, but I am sure the Gen. will see that he is properly looked after -- when Ashby's men are with him they behave gallantly, but when they are away they lack the inspiration of his presence, and being undisciplined they often fail to do any good -- only a few days ago a company of 50 of them were taken prisoners through a lack of care in guarding themselves. The excitement was intense along the line of our march this side of Harrisonburg, and many left their homes -- I suppose they will return now -- But I do not look for quiet for some time to come, the war is only begun and Heaven only can tell what the future has in store for us -- but the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, and he will do right, and if we are right we shall surely prosper, no matter how dark the heavens may now appear they must become brighter, and through the thick gloom I think we may see the glimmerings of a brighter dawn -- God grant it may soon come. Give my kind love to relations and friends, and kiss my spared children for me -- I wish I could see you, but the Gen. says I may not be spared now -- Send this up and let Brother and family read it, as I have not time to write him now though I desire to -- I have been busy all day, though it is Sunday, by order, and may I be forgiven for it. Send your next letter to Staunton, care of Capt. Bell A.Q.M. to forward by Gen. Jackson's courier -- if we are not back into the Valley before you get this.

       " 'p043_002': 'I have had to wait ever so long for a letter, but have been fully compensated today by yours of last Saturday - the 24 th . How often I thought of you that day, and the next - Christmas, and wished I was with you. I am even vain enough to believe that you would have been happier for my presence. We spent a very quiet Xmas here. And all this week has been unusually dull to me. Indeed I have been rather \"under the weather\" with a wretched cold, which became so bad as to lay me up all day yesterday in my chamber. Today I am better. I think it would be a most unfortuate thing for me to be taken sick where you are, before our marriage, for it makes me so cross & crabbed generally that you would discard me right away & send off to Texas for that despairing youth who has gone there to forget you & his sorrows. So next Saturday the 7th is your birth day. Why are the fates against my being with you then? It does seem to me that all my calculations upon other people miscarry. Do you know that up to this time I have not been able to get Col F from Danville to N. York, and must have him here before I can go home. I wrote two letters to him yesterday. Col. McKaye too is still in Europe. I am frank to say I am not pleased with the present condition of our Company affairs, both R.R. & Land Co. Complications are springing up that will perhaps take a great deal of time & labour to untangle. I am trying by all means in my power to put the \"machines\" in good running order, at great labour and infinite trouble and annoyance. I really think it was well that we did not fix definitely on March for our marriage, as my engagements and affairs do not now promise to be in such shape as early as March, as would enable me to take the season of leizure for several weeks I propose on that happy occasion. It may yet be, that within a couple of weeks when I hope to return to Virginia, I will get them so arranged, that we can even then have time to agree upon March as I originally insisted - if not then I must acquiesce in your original proposition for a later, and to all except me, a more pleasant month. But I will not tire you with the discussion again of a matter we can only settle properly & satisfactorily when I am with you. So our engagement is generally known and discussed in the County. Why not? If it does not annoy you I am sure I feel proud that your good people know how blessed I am to be the accepted lover of the sweetest girl in Eastern V a . Why did you not give me Dr Alexander\\'s opinion, as you say it would amuse me. I know the Dr is not a marrying man and I suppose he thinks I am one most emphatically. Thank Miss Lacey for thinking so well of me as to tell you my presence would make you happier. Assure her that whatever might be the effect on you I should certainly have been very happy. It was very sweet in Ella to send me that kiss through such a channel. I shall certainly have it delivered with interest. I hope her going further south is not from any increase of her malady, but only because this winter has been so cold even away down South. Is it not delightful to know that Sister Lou is coming on to see us married? If anything in addition to the main event of the day could add to my happines then, it would be to have her present. I know how much I owe her for my good fortune, and I wish above all things for her presence to see the hopes I expressed to her crowned with fruition. I hope I shall have but few more letters to write to Miss Annie Lockett from N.Y. Continue to reply to me here until I notify you of the day of my departure, which I will do the very moment I can see my way clear to leave here and not return soon again. You speak of the dull quietness of the Country. You cannot imagine how I long to enjoy it with you. I am tired to death of this great crowded city. I so long for a few weeks back in old Virginia - not in Richmond - but in the depths of the wilderness of Mecklenburg. You make it an Eden to me.

       " 'p032_013': 'In compliance with the requirements of Cir Order No. 6 Series 1866 (B.R.F.&A.L.) I have the honor to report a condition of Bureau affairs in this Division (counties of Augusta & Highland) that Freedpeople are peaceable and generally industrious, while employment is readily procured at fair wages. While this is the rule there are of course exceptions - some Freedmen are restless or indolent and many employers are not disposed to treat with entire fairness the laborers that hire. This is becoming more apparent as engagements for the crop season or year come to a close, and disputes arise (now frequent) on the settlement. The system of long open accounts with Freedmen is a door wide open to admit cheating. The laborer cannot get his money from the employer but his family must eat and he takes Bacon, Flour &c for which he is charged store prices, while for Sugar &c or clothing he must accept  on some storekeeper who charges his own price & quantity and even if these are fairly charged he is not able to keep an account and without knowing it he spends all his earnings. During the past month complaints of this kind have been numerous, but as the Freedman has no check account of his own he cannot substantiate his side of the transaction while the employer has books to verify his side and the complaint falls to the ground. When I ask the question, why did you take all these goods or orders when your contract calls for money, the common answer is \"I could not get money and my family had to eat and be clothed.\" If the Freedman had eduction sufficient to keep an account of quantity & price of all they receive in lieu of money wages it would be no disadvantage to them to take pay in the way but as it is now with them such a custom which is rapidly becoming the system will give opportunity for endless fraud. Where the facts in the case are clear I still find no difficulty in securing payment of wages where there is doubt I can do nothing. There is a general disinclination to come to the Bureau agent to have contracts drawn some employers will not hire a man who wishes it. The circumstances of a majority of Freedmen here are comfortable but those who have to [unclear: incumbrance] are prone to frequent change and do not, while those with large families cannot accumulate. The Aged and helpless will be reasonably cared for by the Overseers of the Poor, but medical aid for the sick in the absence of any Dispensary in the county is out of reach of the poor or if availed of in many cases involves the sick person in debt he cannot pay. I regret the Department is unable to furnish some Medicines for the indigent Freedpeople here, the Social relations between white and colored though in the main unchanged present no sign of improvement, in fact more complaints than usual have been made during this month of both Freedmen and women being beaten by whites on trivial or no provocation. I refer such cases promptly to the District Magistrate but redress is so slow, uncertain & expensive that the result practically increases, not remedies the injury. Nothing can set this right but having at least a majority of Magistrates selected from the non slaveholding class. The Political relations of the White and colored are as friendly as can be expected between parties whose principles are diametrically opposite. That Freedmen will cast their votes for Republican candidates is certain and it is equally certain that their doing so will give great offense to many employers. Already men are being punished in advance in the various ways, so easy for proprietors or employers to resist to without infringing the letter of the law. The moral condition of the Freedmen admits of infinite change for the better and such changes must be brought about before they can advance in the social scale. Even yet the marriage relation is considered more a legal than moral bond and nothing but religious education of the young can obliterate the demoralizing effect of generations of promiscuous intercourse between the sexes, but consent if not encouragement of their masters. I regret I must again report that no Division has yet been organized in Augusta or Highland in connection with the \"Lincoln Temperance Association\" I have tried publicly and privately to form such Divisions but the apathy of those who should lead neutralizes my efforts for the present. There has been less intoxication among freedmen here, during this month than the past. Numerous enquiries continue to be made for relatives sold & separated from each other, but in the large majority of cases the clue is too indistinct to render successful enquiry probable and I do not forward them. The general aspect of the Freedmens future is favorable compared with their former position. Still they have much to do and much to learn to enable them to advance in the march of progress in a corresponding degree with white men and of this fact the Thinking men among them are becoming rapidly convinced and the disposition is not to act aggressively against white men\\'s rights but to be most severely careful of their own rights so suddenly accorded to them.',\n",

For a man never feels more sublime and poet-like than when intoxicated by the voluptuous strains of music; and we who do not wish to deal in rhymetricalrythmical composition had better be on our guard when under its influence, lest from the impulse of the moment some sweet little verses come spontaneously forth.  Oh; music, sphere descending maid, Friend of pleasure, wisdoms aid. how [unclear: just] look there, from singing I can refrain scarce  Hush, my [unclear: lyne] I shall not sing again. Who can properly estimate the effect of music upon the human heart, or the magnitude of the great end for which it was created. In it there is nothing to incite us deeds; but on the other hand it animates those more exalted passions of the heart, creates glorious sensations, and inspires us \"_____ to noble God like deeds.\" Music lulls the fretting babe to sleep - wakens youthful aspirations - destroys the plethora of the sorrowing heart - reanimates the christian\\'s zeal - creates mental inspiration - electrifies the poets fancy - makes the statesman more eloquent - the patriot more devoted and arms the warrior with two fold courage to face the battle storm, to rush undaunted upon his foe shouting \"liberty or death,\" and does a thousand other things too numerous to mention. To me there is music in almost every thing I admire, to me there is music in a pretty woman\\'s eye, in her sweet voice, and in her smile, especially if she is one that I Love.  \"Ther\\'s music on the sighing of a reed, Ther\\'s music in the gushing of a [unclear: hill], Ther\\'s music in all things, if man had ears There earth is but an echo of the spheres.\" Then to what shall we compare a man who has neither taste nor ear for music?

Your sweet letters of the 18th & 19th have been received & read over a dozen times. How much I think of my own little Annie - and how I wish I could be with you at Lawrenceville next Monday night. But there is no chance for that. I am waiting here for the return of Col McKaye from London & may not get back to Virginia for two or three weeks - as long as I could not be in Mecklenburg perhaps I had as well be 500 miles away. You did not inform me where to address my letter during your visit to Brunswick, and as mails in all that wilderness region are like angel\\'s visits, I am afraid to send this to Lawrenceville, lest it gets there a fortnight or so after you have gone. I will therefore continue to write to Lombardy Grove. By the way there is another good reason for this. If you become very anxious to hear from me it may bring you home from your frolicking, and take you out of danger of falling in love with a handsome young heathen from the fine woods of Brunswick. So there is such a sweet, nice very young, lovely Cotton Broker from Nashville just dying for you - and you are so sorry you didn\\'t know it before my visit. Well let him die. Who cares? I am not afraid now of all the Cotton Brokers in Tenn & Ga. Not a bit. You can\\'t scare me by such a ghost. You see I have such implicit confidence in you since you said you would marry me, that I don\\'t feel afraid of rivals but do feel sorry for the poor fellows.

If you love another better than me you can never be happy as my wife - and I would not hold you to the fulfillment of an engagement that would render you miserable. Go & marry him & forget me.\" Yes my darling Annie, all jesting apart, marriage is too serious & solemn a transaction for all time to come to be entered into lightly and thoughtlessly. None are justified in marrying unless they love each other alone all the world besides. Better even at the altar and at the last moment of escape, recede than go forward with certain misery in propsect. But this is all nonsense. You know how tenderly & truly I love you, and I believe I have your heart as completely in return. So I say \"poor Cotton Broker.\" I today recd. a mighty sweet but very short letter from Sister Lou. She was going out & could only answer briefly my letter from Lombardy Grove. By the way I will enclose it to you as she considers me crazy - and advises you to have me put into an asylum. But towards the close of her letter she is very sensible, as you see she will help me to secure you in March. By the way you write so sweetly in regard to the time, deferring so entirely to my wishes that it makes me ashamed to think that I may have appeared too importunate. I wish it to be as early as possible. I therefore urged March. You & your sister seem to have a dread of that chilly blistery month. She urges June. That is too far off & besides is almost in the hottest season of the year - when I would prefer that we should have become quietly settled down rather than being off on a bridal trip. As to next fall that is out of the question. There is no use discussing it. Whilst I then still insist on March, I will not be unreasonable, but will compromise if I can\\'t have my way on an early day in April. I know how much you desire the presence of your sisters and I would not subject them to a trip at a season all seem so much to dread. Understand me I only will agree to this postponement, so that I might not appear so selfish as to disregard entirely the comfort of others. As for you my darling one month will be about as pleasant as another, for I shall bring you right away to the city, the very day we are married, and we will be almost independent of the weather in town - either in Richmond or N. York. I know you will have a pleasant time at Lawrenceville & at the wedding. If our engagement is known it will spoil your flirtations. You will be astonished to find how the beaux will stop making love to you, as soon as they find out you are about thro to throw yourself away on an intruder like me. I want you to write me all about your trip. Tell me how pretty you looked & how sweetly you sung. Tell me all the sweet things said to you, & your sweet replies. I hope you will say to every young rascal that makes love to you, that he is too late. That you are engaged to a most excellent old gentleman \"with 5 children besides you.\" That you begin to feel old yourself, and wish all young fellows to cease talking nonsense to you. I wish you were here now with the girls & me. They are enjoying their N. York very much, as you will yours one of these days soon. I am glad I am so often & so affectionately spoken of in your family. I hope your father will become more reconciled to giving you up. You will be in safe hands tell him.',\n",

Tis useless for me to undertake to give you an idea of the pleasure it affords me to receive a letter from you or to discribe the feeling & interest with which each & every line is carefully read. Would that I could be the recipient of such dear letters every day but truly it is a pleasure that such a character as I do not deserve. Well Christmas is over, it past very quietly with me I met with no gay crowds or rather visited no place where there was merry making. Christmas day I went to Church & heard a very good & appropriate Surmon delivered by Doctor Duncan of this City in the after noone I called on a friend for a Short time & at night went to Church again. Thus past the day making the fourth Christmas Since the war all of which I have spent away from home. The only treat I had during this Christmas week was the receipt of you Ever welcome letter which was handed me yesterday about noone. I am just learning how to appreciate such pleasures. it was always very agreeable to me to correspond with my friend, but situated as I am now makes it doubly so. a way from my home & among Entire strangers leaves me quite a lonely life, it is truly more monotonous here than it was in all my Experiences in camp. tis true, I believe that I have made many freinds while here but I am deprived of the social comforts that I enjoyed with my company for there, I have a fond brother whose society has been the greatest source of my pleasure ever since I have been old enough to duly appreciate a brothers love and were I deprived of a correspondance with you dear Kate - dreary, & all most comfortless, would be Every hour of my life. Just think what a pleasure to have some dear loved one who, though separated from me by many miles, still I have the pleasure of speaking with though it be through the silent medium of the pen, tis truly gratifying believing as I do that I am honored to night with this pleasure of writing to one who loves me with a pure sisterly unselfish love on whose word I may, with impunity confide, believing that her pure heart knows no treachery, one whom I love above all others of her sex, save her to whom I have given my heart & hand, with the promise that the arm & hand which wields this pen shall shield her fragile form, through a life time that I hope may be as pleasantly ahead as the few short hours are now in writing to my dear Sister Kate. You stated in your letter that you wished to know how many brothers & sisters I have. I have four brothers & four sisters. There are nine of us in all. My Father and Mother are both living. My Father is nearly 75 years old. My Mother about 66. I am the youngest son living, I have one sister younger than my self. She is the youngest child & she is grown. Well Kate last Tuesday the 20th one year ago we parted a day Ever to be remembered by me. what wonderful changes has taken place since that Eventfull day. Twas there & then that I gave took the last fond looks upon one who has made a lasting impression upon me though I never (at that time) Expected to see or hear from you again but so forcibly was I impressed though you and strangers as we were these lines presented them selves to me. \"We met as perfect strangers, \"But when we came to part \"Love had improved its image \"Upon my throbbing heart And upon the impulse of the moment I determined to write to you regardless of the result which I did & am proud to say that I have never regretted it. I have found that my ideas of physiognomy & human nature in my slight observation has served me justly. you have proved to be the realization or rather the result of my course has been a realization of what might have been termed a castle built in the air for you are all that I had fancied you were in my silent musings  simple language, a pure hearted kind affectionate good girl. Well dear Kate, I will not impose any longer on your patience, but will close my uninteresting & uninstructive letter. you must remember me kindly to your dear parents & your sisters. say to your Sisters that I am glad to hear that they are so merry hope you all spent a gay Christmas. I wish I could have been with you, tell miss Molly that I did not get light but probably it was for the want of spirits. tell her not to leap to soon - who knows but what Lou may give me a sacking - the Old Augusta then Rose Dale might have increased charms for me, goodby dear Kate I hope miss Molly will pardon me, for my bold suggestion. with my warmest wishes for your wellfare & happiness,',\n",

And I am sorry to inform you that your brother was taken prisaner, also Sargt Hays, James Trotter, Samuel A. Lightner and James Hutcheson, we were on picket at Waidsville on the Opecken river one & a half miles from Brucetown; only thirty men of the 5th Regt was thare a very small force to contend with two brigads of Cavelry, We held them in check for about three quarters of an hour. When about two Hundred charged across the ford getting into our rear, we all clubed together & fell back about two Hundred yards, When the cavelry that had got in our rear charged us cauling loudly on us to surrender, But the little band heeded them not but continued pooring volley after volley into thare midts, almost evry shot taking effect. one charged up within six or eight yards of me whirling his sword around one of company D who threw down his gun & surrendered, he then cauled on me to surrender, the boys kept hollowing to me to shoot him but unfortunatly I had just shot out at the bulk when he road up I pretended to have my gun loaded & ready to shoot him if he moved. Several of the boys fired at him & the balls coming so unplesantly near him he whirled his horse & made tracks we soon percieved we were getting them demorolised & we charged them, driving them from our front, we ha'nt got more than three Hundred yds when thay ware reinforced & charged us again in wich our boys ware taken. thay ware trying to get to a small bunch of timber; seeing they could not reach in time they whirled & fired into the advancing foe & kept loading firing untill thay ware all mixed up with the foe, Seeing thay ware overpowered & a further attempt to whip the enimy usless, thay surrendered. Several of our boys seen them going back under guard, all of us that made for a deep ravine got out safe, one overtook little George Hutchison just as he got to the ravine & ordered him to surrender George said he was almost scared to death at the old sword whizzing around his head but he jumped into the brush & shot the Yank dead of his horse, our loss in killed & wounded was very light One of Comp. H was mortally wounded & died in the eavning his name was Strausburg, a brother to the Strausburg in our band. One of Comp K. recieved a flesh wound in the arm. Our loss was the heavyest in prisaners. Some twelve or fifteen from the regt. The enimy mostly usede thare sabers I am certain thay did'nt loose less than forty in killed & wounded. Jake was enjoying very good health I hope he may meet with kind friends & mild treatment also the rest of our unfortunate friends. Again we are left without an officer in our Comp. It is reported that Sam Hays is on his way down to the Comp. I think the rest of Comp. E will have to go to fort delaware to recruit, we have Eleven hear yet & I am sure we can whip twist that nuomber of Yanks. My health is very good & hope this may find you enjoying the same. Thare has been a great deal of wet weather down hear It has been raining all morning this is a very cold rain. It will not be very long until we will need our over coats. I heard from both of my Brothers C is at Camp Elmira New York & J at the hospital in Baltimore J can begin to use his arm & is enjoying good health, I must close write soon.

       " 'p036_011': 'In compliance with Circular Order No. 6 S. 1866 B.R.F.&A.L. I have the honor to forward the following report of condition of Bureau Affairs in this 4th Div. of 9th Sub Dist. Va comprizing the counties of Augusta and Highland. This office is still visited by many Freedmen asking assistance in making settlements or seeking redress for grievances. Most of the crop accounts of 1864 are now adjusted and the unsettled claims for wages are generally against men who cannot pay and where no written contract exists. Contracts to labor for the year are not so common as could be wished. Two reasons for this are assigned by freedmen. Some say their employers will not make contracts for the year as they intend to discharge them if they do not vote to suit them but most say they can do much better when their agreements are by the month as they can have monthly settlements and know how they stand. I encourage written contracts by the year as much as possible because my experience shows men so employed prove best off at the end of the year, provided they refuse to open store accounts with their employers. The great drawback to Freedmen not employed by the year, is the outrageous rents demanded for Tenements in which to live. As a class freedmen here are not making much progress in material prosperity, the long hard winter eats up the surplus earnings of the harvest season and the sick & widowed and deserted women experience much suffering. The distribution of clothing at this office has done much good, enabling many to go out to labor who otherwise from want of clothing would have been prevented. The corporation and county officers relieve such cases of distress, as have been presented, and no complaints can now be made, except perhaps about the regulations in some county districts, which disallow out  relief and present to the poor only the option of poorhouse or nothing. This month there has been less than usual number of complaints by freedmen of ill usage at the hands of white citizens. Little is now said on political questions it appears to be conceded useless to \"fish\" for the colored vote with the \"base hook,\" and not worth while to offer anything, as the conservatives are confident they will reject the Constitution whatever it may be, either by remaining at home on election day, or dragging every white man to the polls to vote it down. The freedmen are uneasy but hopeful, and will generally cast their votes, but not near so unanimously as at the last election a large proportion of the white men will stay at home anyway. No prospect has been made in organizing Temperance organizations in this Division and I regret that since the distillers here have resumed operations whiskey drinking has become too common among freedmen in country districts where it can be procurred from the still houses.',\n",
       " 'p042_034': 'How I wish I could drop that \"Miss\" and substitute \"my own darling Annie\" for it. I am so sorry to learn from your letter recd. yesterday that my precious little sweet heart is sick. You dont know how I prize the compliment of a letter written by you when you were suffering so much discomfort. That act more than all else you have said or done gives me hope, for when we are sick we do not trouble ourselves about people we are indifferent to. But when you tell me that in your hours of suffering I am remembered I know that your dear heart begins to warm a little bit towards me. If I could only have been with you last week to pet & care for you while sick I believe my tenderness would have met some little response. I have seen so much of human suffering, so many long, sad weary months & years of my life have been shaped by the Couch on which lay for the time the most loved one of all the world to me, that I have acquired the tenderness of your own soft sex in the presence of an invalid - I trust shall never see you sick & a sufferer, but if such should unhappily at anytime be the case how gently I would try to alleviate your pains, and dispel by all the arts love could suggest every thought and feeling of depression. Your sickness has given my thoughts a direction this morning that I am conscious will affect the tone of my letter to you. It seems a strange Providence that those I love should without any known cause suffer more than falls to the general lot. Will you pardon me for alluding to those who were so dear to me, and whose memory I shall always reverence with a tenderness of feeling which their undying virtues merit. Lovelier women than were my wives never lived on earth and with each one my happiness was complete till death destroyed it. I am not conscious of any difference in the degrees of my love for them. Each had my whole heart - And it is now one of the sincerest pleasures I can enjoy to talk about them, & not let their names and memory die in my family. I will & do love you as well as I loved them, and if you are ever the wife of my bosom as they were, I want you to appreciate my feelings on this subject and to feel that as the living possessor of a heart that was and is so true to them, you can afford to listen sometimes to the recital of their love history. It is because they were so good, so noble, so pure & so beloved by me that I feel that it were better for me to be dead than not to have a living object, in all respects as lovely as they were, upon which to pour out the pent up affection of my oft lacerated, wounded, but I know still loving nature. The human heart is a curious study. It is in my opinion capable of almost infinite love. And I believe that the man whose whole soul has been dedicated at the shrine of wedded love to the service & worship of a pure & noble woman, is after her death capable of more devotion to a similar object of adoration, than if he had never known the joys of this holiest of all relations on earth. To be plainer, the widower whose married life was supremely happy can renew that life with another, and unless he does so his existence becomes more miserable every day he lives alone. No man knows fully the incalculable worth of a true woman till he is called upon to part from one forever, who was \"love of his life & flesh of his flesh.\" If he would honor her virtues rightly he can best do so by finding another like her, and then the memory of his past loss makes him appreciate more highly his newfound treasure. If you were this day my wife, how I should watch over and guard you from all harm seeing in you the impersonation of all your sex I have ever loved. These are unusual topics of discussion in such a correspondence as ours. But I feel as if I wanted to say these things to you even before we meet again - for I address myself not alone to your heart, but to your excellent sense. I know if I ever saw your whole heart, & less I would not have, it must be after your judgment has passed upon my history and character. I am not yet prepared to say on what day I will return to Va. Col. Flournoy went home yesterday. On Friday our Board of Directors ordered books of subscription to be opened here this week for $200,000 cash banking capital and I was appointed one of a Committee to attend to it. I hope to get away now in a very few days, but I want you to write here again. If I have gone the letter will be sent to Richmond after me. I am very anxious to hear that you are well again. So write at once. I did promise you that picture & you shall have it, but I think I would rather take it to you than to send it. I will send your sister one to Atlanta. How you must miss her. You ought to love her very much for she is a most loveable woman. If ever she is my sister I shall love her as devotedly as ever an elder brother loved a sweet sister. Always remember me to her when you write. I am glad I am sometimes spoken of in your family. Do they tease you about your old widower beau? Did any body do so at Buffalo? Hang the Knights of that Tournament for their lack of taste, if you were only second, & not first at the coronation - I would put you first every where. I am at the Grand Central Hotel here with a house full of Virginians - Major Intherlin of Danville & family, Gen. Anderson & family of Richmond & many others. I spend my evenings with the old ladies of the party. I wish you were here as one of the old ladies, matronizing my pretty daughters Jennie & Russie, who would astonish the folks around in the Parlor by addressing you as \"Mama\". Wouldn\\'t you look grand & old? In my next I can tell you where I will be at Lombardy Grove. Flournoy wants me to go to Tennessee first but I won\\'t do it.

Then we were up by day the next morning, poking along through towards Culpeper C.H. driving the Yankee picket before us, and camping along the road for several miles last night -- in fact reaching some 6 miles, the Division of Gen. A.P. Hill being in the rear. The enemy attempted to fall upon our rear last night, with a strong cavalry force, but they \"caught a Tartar,\" finding us ready for them, & were repulsed, we taking some 15 prisoners, at one point, and they attacked at another point & met the same fate -- we have taken some 350 of Pope\\'s Cavalry, now, some officers that we shall hold as hostages for the treatment of our people by Pope -- ( here we were ordered forward & away from my seat under a tree) I resume my writing on a hill top, in full view of several thousand of the enemy cavalry that have been drawn up all day in the hot sun, -- while we are maneuvering to take them, have been sitting round here all the evening -- trying to find out the enemy\\'s position 4 P.M. the battle has opened -- & we must  on -- it is about 6 miles west of Culpeper C.H. -- Sunday 6 A.M. -- the firing has opened again We had a bloody day yesterday -- as desperate a fight as I ever saw -- but we drove the enemy away from the battle field, took 12 leads of ammunition, 1 large piece of artillery, some 400 prisoners, one Brig. Gen. & a good many officers. The fight continued until 9 P.M. Our Gen. Winder was killed & we had a good many others killed & wounded -- We lost a good many men & killed & wounded large numbers of the enemy most of which they left on the battle field.

I had the pleasure of listening to an excellent sermon this morning delivered by the Revd Mr. [unclear: Cee], Pastor of Tinkling Spring Congregation. He read for his morning\\'s sermon the 4th Chapter of Daniel, prefaced by a few remarks & then took for his text, the words found recorded in the 5th Chapter of the 1st Epistle general of Peter and 6th Verse.

Aug  Annie: I failed to finish my letter yesterday owing to the fact that there was a lot of clothing came in to the Regt. which had to be issued out to the different Companies, which necessarily consumed some time and then the preaching. I must say that yesterday was one of the most interesting days I hve ever spent in camp; it [unclear: appeared] more like sunday that if it had been, so quiet was every thing around. By the way there were some dozen ladies in camp too who added very much to the interestingness of the occasion. I would have liked so much could I have been with you all. Suppose the [unclear: Dr] held  at Providence or was it his time at the Ridge? Suppose you had a gay time while the Miss [unclear: Corrans] were down. Would liked to have happened in some night about the time you were cutting up, as I know you did.

       " 'p032_033': 'A letter dated Staunton Oct 4/67 purporting to be but not in E. Lawson\\'s handwriting, forwarded by you to Mr. Whipple Oct. 8 has been sent here for recognition. Some statements are palpably and some inferentially untrue and did it not reflect upon the present condition of schools and lead to a possible supposition that my application for aid in fitting up the room here was unnecessary, I will should not, as I must say the letter is written by Mr. Tukey and is only a continuation of the [unclear: undermining] operation which the schools here have had to contend against from the same source. In fact, \"the house\" was rented for school purposes at $25 per month because there was no place in which to teach school as the church building spoken was not even roofed in. Through the influence of Mr. Brackett, seconded by yourself the B.R.F.&A.L. appropriated $300 in aid on the condition that the building aided should accomodate all scholars in Staunton. [unclear: Promises] were fairly made but when Mr. Bowser, the [unclear: co\\'d] presiding elder came to Staunton he candidly told me that under no circumstances would he permit the use of the church upper room for school purposes, nor ever give an assurance of continued possession of the basement (which only cost $150 in addition to the contract) for school purposes if I paid over the $300 which I of course declined to do. The basement has not been fitted up even yet and when the estimable ladies who have left, taught a pay school after the close of regular session which of course was small [unclear: compared] with a free school the room was unfit to accomodate any orderly school, but when school was talked of for the winter and I applied for the room the Trustees, induced I expect by the writer of the letter in question, asked $15 per month and would not fix up for a school room. Feeling that after the church had rec\\'d $1,000 from the N. M. E. conference and repeated aid from the Bureau and Teachers, I proposed to expend $100 in fitting up the room to be occupied rent free for the season which they refused, and took no steps to fit up at all. The parents of the children began to complain bitterly, many claiming they had subscribed their money for a school house, not a church. Mr. Brackett came here and a meeting was called which I attended with him and laid the case so strongly before them that the Trustees were shamed into doing something and agreed to give the room free if I would get them $100 to fit up, which thanks to you, I have obtained from the Bureau and I expect to have the room ready for permanent school on Monday Oct. 21. The $60 alluded to was begged I believe in aid of the main building if used for a school but (as I with the $300) they properly refused to give it to a church who would not encourage even a school. The conceit spoken of was got up at great labor by the Teachers and the money raised which was a mere trifle expended for school but not church purposes. The real writer of the Lawson letter did not even attend the concert nor has given a cent or even an hour labor in Sabbath school. The real object of the letter is not to aid the cause of education but to bring Mr. Scott here under Am. Miss. Assn. & through him employ Mrs. Tukey and Miss Dunn as Teachers. To accomplish this \"financial\" desideratum every effort has been made and if fair means were used or good would result I should gladly say \"Take the work\". We have now 112 scholars registered for Miss Rowells school a number she cannot possibly control but I cannot recommend that Mr. Scott or any one who would bring back the \"old regime\" be sent to aid her, as the joint work would certainly prove unpleasant and so far unprofitable. I fear my letter to you may offend Mr. Brackett and I trust it will be confidential except in so far as it may affect your opinion of my application for aid, and even by inference reflect upon the active, conscientious and able management of Mr. Brackett or his teachers.',\n",

       " 'p021_026': 'I have the honor to report that I have made a tour through the greater portion of my District, which is yet unorganized owing to my inability to procure officers, and the lack of troops in the several counties. I have stationed civilians as Assist Superintendents at the principle points, Winchester, Staunton, and Lexington, and have thus been enabled to [unclear: convey] the impression throughout this region that the freedmen are being cared for, and that they may not be ill-treated with impunity. The freedmen are generally at work but whether or not for their former masters cannot be determined in the absence of census returns. The feelings of the former masters are now [unclear: adverse] to the interests of the Freedmen whose newly acquired rights they are not disposed to respect although they verbally acknowledge their freedmen as \"free persons of color.\" If left to themselves by the withdrawal of the military, the former masters would generally resume the old mastership, and the condition of the freedmen [unclear: becomes] worse than when they were slaves. The freedmen in this Shenandoah Valley, as a class, are superior to those of the James River region, have a brighter appearance, quicker movements, and more readily appreciate their new relations and responsibilities. Nearly all of them have gone to work, the larger number under definite contracts or agreements, which will terminate in December - \"Christmas\" of this year. The selection of this time for the ending of contracts appears to be owing, first, to the fact that the freedmen have been accustomed to look forward to that time as a period when work ceases, and have but rarely been able to look beyond that time, and, second, because the employers would then be able to dispense with the services of many of them, having very little work to do in the succeeding three months, coupled with a malicious desire to [unclear: throw] them on their own resources in mid Winter, or compel their friends the Yankees to support them. It appears to me that these charitable designs may best be met by giving them, the Whites, to understand that they must support their paupers. A simple and just measure that would at once put a stop to \"cabin burning\", \"sending \\'em to the yankees\" and other similar characteristic proceedings of our Southern brothers. If some such step be not taken there will be a large number of dependents to be supported this winter. As yet there have been very few cases of helpless ones in this District but they are beginning to come in and will increase until about Christmas when a great number will be thrown out of work and home. When our troops occupied this place, Staunton there were barrack hospitals and other buildings which would have been ample for the shelter of the destitute in this portion of the District, but they have been demolished and the lumber used or sold so that there is nothing left available for the use of the Bureau, nor is there a vacant building of any description to be obtained in or near the city Throughout this District the same characteristics are noticeable. There are no vacant houses, no abandoned lands. The people generally remained at their homes and raised subsistence for the rebel army. The few who left speedily returning at the close of hostilities. There are no sources of [unclear: revenue] that I have been able to discover. The collection of [unclear: b---] could not be prosecuted for want of men, - they were at work - of wagons, more could be had - of [unclear: b---], - they had been gathered; the Sheridan Mine at the lower end of the valley completely [unclear: ---ted]. Necessary funds must, then, be procured from without the District. Rations have been issued to but a very small number of twelve (12) and no estimate can now be made of the number to be supplied, and if that number shall not be considerably increased there would seem to be no [unclear: interference] with the ordinary supplies for the troops, and no issuing officers [unclear: necessary]. No demands have as yet been made for medical attendance, but there will be frequent requests when the cold damp weather of this season in this climate shall set in and at this moment I am inclined to the employment of a local physician when suitable persons can be found, as they may be presumed to be familiar with both the patients and the diseases of the place. The establishment of schools is ardently desired by the freedmen all over the District, and the difficulties in the procurement of School rooms, Teachers, Books, and everything else will, I hope, be speedily overcome as the time for beginning to shed light upon darkness is close at hand.',\n",

After I left you I went up to the Provost-Marshall\\'s office but found such a crowd then that it was impossible for me to get a pass in time to leave on the train. Consequently I went down to the depot with the the determination in my cranium to \"run the block.\" When a arrived there I found this to be impossible for the guard was too vigilant for me. I then jerked out my letters from [unclear: Ted ] Smith directed to Col Smith and Gen Wharton and marching up to the officer of the guard told him that \"here was dispatches from Gov. Smith that must certainly go up by today\\'s train.\" He said he could not help it, no one could get on the train without a pass from the Provost- M.  I then thought I must would have to [unclear: prolong ] my visit in Richmond another day. But just as the cars were about to start, the captain of the guard came to me in company with the officer whom I had solicited to let me pass and asked to see the dispatch which I had to carry. \"Certainly said I you can see them.\" Now in the corner of one was the inscription \"Through the kindness of Maj. Gen. Breckinridge.\" (It was the intention of Mr. Smith to send them by Gen. B. but did not get to do so). This inscription of course [unclear: added substance] to the subject, and the Captain said if I would bear all responsibility - he would let me pass. And as there he did not want to let the guard know anything about the affair he took out his key and let me into the ladies car - there being no entrance at that door. So I had a nice ride in the ladies car the whole way to Fishersville. Did you get off on the Petersburg train or did you have to walk? I felt very sleepy on my way up as I did not go to bed the preceeding night until one oclock. I tell you I made things \"   \" with Miss Emma that night.

One box of  & fixins fell off one wagon & there was a smash up -- they picked up the fragments -- It was late when we got here. The king of the fleas holds a court there -- bit Hanger & Crawford badly. The Mts here literally milk the clouds for the dew covers everything like a rain -- it looks beautiful on the leaves -- especially those of the cucumber trees, which are very large here. The sides of the Mts are finely variegated by the flowers of the laurel, snow white, & the deep yellow evening primroses. Hanger says it is time to start --  Monterey -- Friday night -- We got here just at dark quite tired -- the road is rough & where it has been McAdamized the stones are not much broken down yet. It has been a very fine day -- warm & clear -- the Mts look finely -- the laurels cover the sides in many places. We took dinner at McDowell on the bank of the river We met a good many that we knew today; Little John Crawford, Wm Sterrett, Bol. Christian &c at different places on the Mts. My team keeps ahead of the others and I wait for them & rest my horses very often and make observations -- have taken the elevation of all the Mts. we have passed over. The wheat, what little there is, in this country, is very green yet, it looks strangely. The grass looks very fresh. There is no news of importance from the Army -- it is rumored that the Federal forces are leaving Philippa & that we are advancing, slowly, because the Federals have obstructed the road as much as possible, felling trees across it &c.

It is reported that our troops have gone to Buckhannon, that is our Cavalry & those with them that have been on Rich Mt. I suppose I shall know what has been done or is doing, when I get to the camp. We eat out of doors from our boxes & Hanger & Crawford sleep out by the wagons -- I think I shall try a bed tonight -- don't know. Montery has not grown any in 10 years, it looks weather beaten & well it may for it is up in world high enough to get the benefit of all the storms -- the head spring of the South Branch of the Potomac is here & the James heads only a half mile off so it is on the top of the water shed -- It seems a long, long way here, but they go to Staunton in a day, 46 miles. The stages meet here for breakfast in the morning very early, so we shall hear the news from each way before we start. We came across three Mts today. My fingers are stiff & sore from holding the lines & I cannot write much. I hope you have gotten entirely well & are getting along finely be sure to write to me to Beverly & I shall get it the day we get there if you write by the next mail after this comes.

Gen. Ayres has found it necessary to send a guard with the supply wagons, because the drivers were stoned by mobs. I attempted the establishment of a civilian Asst.

       " 'p040_011': \"In compliance with Circular No VI - dated Head Quarters, Asst Commissioner Richmond Va Jan'y 29, 1866 I have the honor to submit the following Report of Bureau Affairs in 4th Division (Comprising Highland and Augusta Counties) 9th Sub District Virginia viz: Nothing has transpired during the present month calculated in any way to change the tenor or my last report. The main difficulties under which the freedmen labor are just and proper settlement of their accounts with their employers, yet through the aid and instrumentality of this office many complaints of this character have been fairly adjusted. On account of the disposition manifested toward the colored population even while the latter were under the protection of the Bureau, I fear that its withdrawal, at this time will have a very damaging effect upon the interests of the colored community. Some suffering [unclear: evidently] exists among a class of this population chiefly I think among women and children for want of the necessary clothing for winter wear. They wages in this locality are small, not averaging over $4 or $5 00  per month for females, and it requires all they can possibly earn to buy provisions and pay house rent which is exorbitant [unclear: without] parallel, Consequently nothing remains with which to provide for their warmth and comfort. Applications to this office, by females especially, have been numerous during the present month, but as all articles suitable for this class of applicants had been previously issued it was impossible to alleviate the suffering so plainly demonstrated. The Aged and indigent are also in some distress for want of proper care and provision in this respect. The County of Augusta has made provision for its paupers, but there seems to be a great disinclination to aid any except they become inmates of the Institution provided for this class of persons. -- (With the exceptions above enumerated the freedpeople seem to be doing as well and are as prosperous as could be expected.) The school at Staunton, opened on the 23rd inst under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, and taught by Mr. Jno Scotts At this time there is every prospect of a large and increased attendance over any previous term and I have no reason to doubt that a successful and profitable session will ensue. The only drawback now apparent is the want of a suitably and properly arranged and ventilated School room. The one now in use is the basement of the ME Church (colored) which in my opinion is inadequate and in almost every respect unsuitable for school purposes at this place. It is found necessary, for the accommodation of that class of colored persons who are obliged to labor during the day, to carry on a night school - at least four evenings in the week, but by present indications I fear trouble in procuring the use of this basement even for this purpose, as the Church authorities require its use for religious meetings nearly every evening. The Schools in other localities are very backward, for want of proper pecuniary support of the community. The one heretofore in operation at Arbor Hill Augusta County, the teacher was forced to close for the season on the 31st ultimo. The school at Waynesboro will probably open sometime during the coming month The slow progress made in finishing the school building and the inability to procure a suitable teacher soon has caused this delay. Intemperance does not seem to be increasing in this locality to any marked extent among the freedmen, and so long as the white population does not set them an example, I have no doubt very little can be accomplished toward overcoming this Evil.\",\n",

       " 'p012_001': 'Having just returned from my imprisonment in Washington I hasten to offer my deepest sympathy in the sad bereavement which has fallen upon us in the death of yr. noble Husband. On the fatal day of his immolation upon the altar of Patriotism, I was guarded by hireling Yankees, in full view of our forces; compelled to witness their heroic sufferings, without being able to offer aid or consolation to my wounded and dying companions. Late Saturday evening a prisoner was brought into our crowd, who informed us that Col. Baylor had fallen, mortally wounded, that day; while lifting the Colors of his his Regiment from the ground where they had fallen wh. the gallant color-bearer of the 5th. I can not describe my emotions on receiving this intelligence. I felt as if my own brother had been stricken from my side. I [unclear: rebelled] at the Providence that denied me the privilege of being by his side and following his remains to their final resting place. I recalled the hours wherein we had [unclear: communed] together upon our beds; and remembered the deep anxiety which he always expressed in the success of my efforts to awaken a religious interest, in the regiment; how he cheered up, as I would tell him of one and another of his men, who had come to converse wh. me, on the subject of religion; and said wh. earnest emphasis \"I would rather a revival of religion in my Regiment than to realize any temporal advantage whatever\" This solicitude for the conversion of souls, manifested by word and acts, is one of the most satisfactory evidences of a change of heart. It is the first impulse of a renewed heart to long forthe conversion of others. Another characteristic struck me as very indicative of a saving change. I never knew a man addicted to swearing that could refrain from profanity when provoked, without Divine assistance: and yet I have seen Col. Baylor under the most harrassing provocations, without yielding to the promptings of his old habit. He had completely mastered, at least, that habit. Before I had indulged the hope of his conversion, I was frequently astonished at his discriminating views on the subject of experimental piety. He seemed to delight in spending hours, after others were asleep, in analyzing the emotions of his own heart and repeatedly said that he would make a profession of religion; but for his fears of being again ensnared by the world. He also expressed a preference for the Ministry as a profession above all others. But his conversation during the last day we were together (Tuesday before his death) furnished the strongest proof of his concern on the subject of religion and his faith the power of Prayer. He asked not less than half a dozen times, during the day, an interest in my prayers, in view of the impending conflict, and the last words that he spoke to me were \"Walton, I do hope that Christians are praying for us, at home.\" He frequently conversed with Gen. Jackson on religious subjects. It is well known that the General indulged the warmest feeling of esteem and affection for your Husband. On one occasion, when he thought that Col. Baylor was absent from his command and a severe engagement was going on he expressed fears that the Brigade would not maintain its reputation; but when he was told that your Husband was at his post, he replied \"all is right, they will prove worthy of their commander.\" Our whole Brigade mourns with you his irreparable loss. I have sent a short obituary to the Religious Herald and will forward a copy to you. Now dear Gawsey, Harken to this solemn call, learn its fearful teachings and cease more entirely from earth & the joys of earth, that you may obtain a firmer hold upon those joys that are eternal. Love from Jeanette & self to all your Mother\\'s family.',\n",
       " 'p039_005': 'In compliance with Circular No. 5 Series of 1867 from your Head Quarters, I have the honor to submit the following report of a tour of Inspection through this Sub District viz: First Division, comprising Frederick Co. 1st The General Condition of the Freedpeople in this Division has steadily advanced, since last report. They have been generally employed at fair wages, are industrious and prosperous and beside being self-sustaining very many have purchased small lots of land and built dwellings in which they reside. The example of the latter class has stimulated others, who are making every effort to secure homes for their families. The moral condition of the race, though improved, is not as satisfactory as could be desired. Many desertions of husband from wives are reported, and bastardy is still too common. The indifference with which the public looks upon the latter crime, in white and colored persons, renders it if not respectable, as no obstacle to future preferment. Until public opinion undergoes a radical change on this subject, but little improvement can be looked for. Except in cases of old age or sickness, but few applications for relief were made  the public. As the winter approaches, herewith and labor becomes scarce, many heads of families, with the most tireless industry find that the product of the years labors insufficient to clothe and feed the many helpless children. The [unclear: compromising] appearance of the corn crop in this county adds to their fears for the coming winter. The religious divisions of the people has also made divisions on the school question. This is very much to be regretted, and although each denomination is making arrangements to sustain sectarian schools, still by an unanimous cooperation a good site for a schoolhouse can be obtained, free of cost, the title to be vested in a board of trustees, to be used for school purposes forever, and a school established on such site without sectarian prejudice could not fail to be much more efficient than the others. The house in course of erection by the Bethelites, and one contemplated by the Freewill Baptists will not be in condition to use for School purposes the coming winter if ever. 2d The disposition of local Magistrates to administer impartial justice is good. Local class prejudices are too strong, however to expect it in jury trials. In almost all cases wealth, influence and race will influence justice against poverty stricken freedmen. 3d The Register of Marriages is completed, and each of the four paragraphs of Cir. 11 Series 1866, have been fully and repeatedly read and explained at the several churches, and none can plead ignorance of the Law. The state authorities take no action to prevent lewdness and adultery, and altho cognizant of the existence of both; do not attempt to remedy. 4t The County Authorities provide for indigent freedpeople, as they do for the same class of whites and the means at their disposal are adequate for the purpose. Few freedpeople, however, can be induced to avail themselves of the privilege owing to a superstitious belief that \"all who enter the Poorhouse will soon die there.\" 5t The Supply of Labor was less than the demand during the quarter, while for the coming months it will be largely in excess. Wages range from $8 to $15 per month, according to quality of help, few however receive money for labor but are compelled to take Corn, Bacon, Clothing and such other necessaries as they may require, and are frequently astonished to find themselves in debt, at the expiration of contracts where they expected to find a balance in their favor. The total inability of the Freedmen to keep accounts of time or articles received operates greatly to their disadvantage in the settlements of claims for services rendered. 6t No Schools were in session during the quarter. This month closes the vacation and teachers are shortly expected to return. Efforts are being made to organize schools at Newtown and Middletown, the only places now destitute where a sufficient number of pupils could be found to attend. Second Division comprising Clarke, Warren and Page Counties. 1st In this division the general condition of the freedpeople appears to be prosperous No considerable numbers are congregated at any one place and consequently labor is in acute demand at fair prices; and all are employed. In consequence of their isolated condition, and the consequent difficulty in organizing for mutual consent of action, their advancement socially is slow. The Schools were presided over by teachers altogether incompetent for the work, and although the moral effect was advantageous to the people, the actual progress was exceedingly slow. As at other sections, the complaints of bastardy are numerous and white men are not infrequently accused by colored women of being the fathers of their children. Owing to the constant demand for labor, by very little of any actual suffering exists at any season in this division. The freedpeople are generally reported as peaceable industrious and willing to abide the terms of Contracts. 2d Local Magistrates seem disposed to render fair and impartial justice in cases in which freedmen are parties. It cannot be denied however, that the prejudices of juries are against the freedmen and that wealth, influence & the pride of race oppose a powerful bar to the claims of justice. 3d The Register of Marriages is believed to be complete as far as practicable, in each of the Counties in the division, and each of the four paragraphs of The Records, Books and papers at Captain Ripley\\'s office are in a satisfactory condition, and everywhere throughout the Division, progression in freedmen\\'s affairs is evident. Third Division, comprising the Counties of Shenandoah & Rockingham 1st General Condition- All the freedpeople who are able to work, are employed at prices varying from $8 to $12 per month. At Harrisonburg they appear to be in a very prosperous condition, they have erected a good schoolhouse at an expense of about $600, and during the last term of the school paid by contribution about $40 per month toward the supply of teachers. Extraordinary efforts will be made in this Division during the coming winter to increase the number of schools and it is hoped with success. The very bitter political prejudice of a large number of the Whites in is   made manifest [unclear: whenever] the slightest opportunity [unclear: presents] is very [unclear: much to be] regretted. Woodstock, [unclear: Edinburgh] and New Market are noted for the hostility on the part of their citizens towards men from the North, Officers of the Government, and to men of [unclear: Union] Republican [unclear: principles]. Bt LieutCol. [unclear: Wm. Lynch] 44th  Infy recently on duty in the Bureau was  on the  of Woodstock by parties      him  and  the [unclear: officer] of political   at  has    the  of his house and the cut into [unclear: fragments]. Such outrages have the effect to [unclear: infuriate] the colored persons. Selina Jackson, a freedgirl having been repeatedly assaulted for giving evidence against a party of men accused of cutting down and burning a flagpole in front of the Bureau office at Woodstock and being unable to obtain redress or protection, was compelled to [unclear: leave] the County to escape further violence. Since the arrival of Mr. James Agent of the Bureau at Woodstock, no reports of abuse have been made, and it is sincerely hoped such [unclear: censurable] practices will soon cease altogether. 2d It is believed the Magistrates intend to administer fair and impartial justice altho\\' complaints have been made that they have not done since the case of Selina Jackson. Perhaps it is fair to presume that they are not prepared to fully oppose strong local prejudices which could not fail to be disastrous to Magistrates engaged in business. It is very doubtful if fair and impartial juries can be found to try cases in which colored men are parties. 3d The Register of Marriages is completed in each County, and each of the four paragraphs are believed to be carried out as far as practicable. 4t The County Authorities provide for the indigent freedpeople as they do for the whites, and their means are ample. 5t The supply of labor is less than the demand but no encouragement can be given for the introduction of more at this season In the Spring from three to four hundred (300 to 400) agricultural hands could find ready employment at prices before stated. 6t There were no schools in Session during the quarter - Strasburg, Mount Jackson and New Market, in addition to the places at which schools have already been established seem to require schools, and at least fifty (50) pupils at each place would attend, but the people, from indifference and poverty will offer no reliable inducement towards an effort to organize schools at those places. The interest taken by Mr James in the affairs of this division will it is believed be production of excellent results. As the freedman\\'s friend, he will labor for their advancement socially, encourage education, and it is hoped bring about a better state of feelings between the race than has heretofore existed. Fourth Division, comprising Augusta and Highland Counties 1st The General condition of affairs indicate that advancement in intelligence is gradually being made by the Freedmen. They are generally employed at reasonable wages, are industrious and show by their deportment that they are disposed to make themselves athrifty, self-supporting and law abiding population. But little idleness and much less drunkenness prevails - improvement in that respect being observed. They are disposed to abide by the conditions of contracts, and the obligations and duties they sustain to each other in assuming a more substantial aspect. Taking everything into consideration the condition of Freedmen\\'s affairs, especially in reference to those matters for which they are responsible, is marked by steady advancement. They have a lively appreciation of the importance of education and are generally interested in the question of Schools. Extreme suffering is not reported nor observed and with the exception of the Aged, and decrepid, all appear to be contentedly employed. 2d In cases where a colored person is opposed to a white man the influence of wealth and race are strongly felt by juries and not seldom overpower evidence & facts. The higher courts, I am satisfied do not to any observable extent refuse justice on account of race & color, but the statement of a colored man, as compared with that of a white man does not appear to have the same weight with Judge or Jury. 3d The Registry of Marriages is completed for Augusta County and nearly so for Highland. The difficulty of getting the people to attend to this matter, owing to imperfect communication with those at remote  has caused the delay. Par. 1 of Cir. 11 Series of 1866 is fully carried out in Augusta and nearly so in Highland County Par. 2d The officers and Agents have fully explained the provisions of the paragraph in all the Churches Par. 3 Clergymen and others are fully congnizant of the provisions of this paragraph - The State Authorities do nothing to prevent adultery or lewdness. Par. 4  Has been fully explained, and none can plead ignorance of the law. It is believed that but one surname is used. 4t The Overseers of the Poor seem disposed to provide for both races alike, and render to our relief in many cases where parties can do something for their own support. The means to provide for all is ample for the demand. 5t The supply of Labor as in the other divisions is unequal to the demand. All are at work and others could find employment at from $8 to $12 per month. 6t No Schools were open during the Quarter It is the cause of much regret among the Freedpeople that the operations of the Bureau are to cease on the 1st January next. The prosperity and social advancement which has attended their progress each year is attributable to that protection with which the government has shielded them in their efforts to realize the blessings of freedom. Without the continuance of that protection they will be as heretofore, defrauded by men who have been accustomed and still do look upon them as their property. The law it is true protects them; but without the means to employ the law with efficacy and too ignorant & unsophisticated to take the proper initiatory steps for their protection they becoming [unclear: disheartened] and hopeless of success abandon their just claims. When told that the local civil officers are loyal and good men, they reply that those same local officers were slaveholders before the war, and that altho\\' loyal to the government the same local prejudices and interests in business will influence them to as great an extent as if over  they naturalyfeel that their only dependence is on the officers who are entirely independent of local influence, and who they know are their friends, and they say as they feel, that if with officers who are appointed at Washington, with no local prejudices whatever they can barely get justice how can we hope when they are [unclear: rendered] to obtain the slightest recognition of our rights from those who if no influence was felt would claim us as their chattels.\" That the view they have thus taken is well founded there can be no doubt. The evident desire to defraud the freedmen of their hard earned due in very many cases, cannot be disputed. The amounts tho\\' generally small are nevertheless of great consequence 15 destitute families, and without some officers whose special duty it will be to attend to this class of complaints, a large sum in the aggregate will be annually lost to the freedmen. It is a matter of congratulations to record the marked improvement in the condition of the colored people throughout the whole Sub-district With industry and economy applications for relief of food and clothing have almost ceased. The Churches have been filled with well-clad, and orderly congregations, and very many [unclear: p---t] with pleasure and  to the little house and lot, which tho\\' not all paid for, they call with honest pride their own. It has been found impracticable to organize temperance societies, still amongst the freedmen drunkenness is rarely to be seen and only in cases of confined  in the larger towns. The great necessity of the race (as of  any) is education (and cultivation, and tho\\' unwilling to contribute much material aid to the support of schools, owing to the fact that little if any assistance has been required of them heretofore, they fully realize and appreciate the advantages which instruction in the elements of education confers upon the fortunate possessor, and gradually perceive the worth of knowledge for its own sake independent of the pecuniary advantages its possession confers. The proficiency of the pupils and the marked attention noticed in many cases on the part of both parents & teachers is the signal of success, and there can be no doubt that the feelings of pride in their children and love for them will as in the case of white people be found a sufficient stimulus for them to exact themselves as much as possible to send their children (& go themselves to school), and it is confidently expected that a wide attendance and still more liberal support on the part of parents will be had by all the schools which may be [unclear: started] in this sub District this winter.',\n",
       " 'p038_005': 'I have the honor to make the following brief statement, and application, to which, I venture to hope, you will accord a favourable consideration. I claim to have been strictly a loyal man to the U.S. Gov. during the Rebellion - have ever been so - refusing to aid the Rebel Gov., at the point of the Bayonet, in this city. After suffering, more than I should be willing to inflict upon you in a communication, or otherwise, I made my escape through the lines. I am a native Virginian, and after the suppression of the Rebellion, returned to Staunton (Augusta County), at which place I became connected with the Bureau R. F. & A. L. as Comr. or agent, on the part of the Freedmen; and also clerk for Mr. F. S. Tukey, then Asst. Supt. of that Sub-Dist. After the Freedman\\'s Court was abolished by orders I was connected with the U.S. B.C. at Staunton. Upon the completion of the work returned to Richmond where I have attempted to resume my profession (I am a teacher of Music) but owing to the fact of being well known as an uncompromising Union man, having been connected with the Bureau, and having testified before the \"Reconstruction Committee\" (to which I beg leave to call your attention) I find it totally impossible to make a support for myself and child at my profession on account of the direct and indirect influences operating against the interests of loyal men. Having no means I have no resources but to seek employment in some branch of the Gov. In view of these circumstances, General, I herewith respectfully make application to you for a clerkship or any situation in your gift in your Dept. where I could be useful and derive a support for myself and child. I refer to Mr. F. S. Tukey, Asst. Supt. in Caroline County, Lieut. Lahea Asst. Supt. at Farmville, Prince Edward County, and will present the [unclear: endorsation] of loyal citizens of Richmond. I will have certificates from [unclear: Messrs.] Tukey and Lahea in a few days.

       " 'p023_003': 'You will notice by the enclosed \"Report\" that some of the schools have not increased in numbers during the last month and that in all there are but 3 more scholars than before. In regard to this fact I would say that a change of place among the freedmen has somewhat annoyed us, during the past month, especially in our night work. There has been many new scholars added to the roll but, Christmas seems to be a time for making changes among these people. I have crossed off 200 names from my register, and added several but those coming to Staunton to spend the winter generally defer coming to school til after the holidays, When I expect a larger attendance than ever, at both the night and day schools. I think the schools are all making fair progress both in manners and study. Our Singing in the morning comes after repeating the \"Lords Prayer,\" and the reading of a few verses from the Bible, by the teacher, in which children engage by repeating after him, line by line. The singing is grand, and in the morning is exclusively Sunday School songs, that they may be learned for the Sabbath. At the sound of the bell it would be pleasing to see them form into line after recess, and prepare to march into the school room. As the bell strikes again the different lines headed for the different rooms more quietly forward, removing their hats as they enter the room. Then again comes the singing, and to accommodate two of the schools, that wish to sing together, and to save fuel I have cut a door through the partition, which we slide open during this exercise and our morning devotions, and sometimes to warm the other room as nothing but the stove pipe heats it. Yesterday was a grand day for Mrs Dunns first class who came marching into my room with a new Testament as a New Years gift, and a reward for the study by which they gained their promotion. We have had a weeks vacation during the holidays, but it was has been but a poor vacation to me. I have worked nearly all the time from 6 in the morning to 9 at night, Saturdays and all ever since I have been here. The colored people have relieved me of much anxiety in regard to the Sabbath School by purchasing an old market house, which they are going about fitting up as a church They had become so opposed to meeting in the basement of the Methodist Church, after they were told that the colored preacher could not preach in that church, that nearly all the Sabbath School refused to come Out of 210 names of scholars and 23 teachers, not more than 35 of the former or 6 of the latter came, and reasoning with them appeared useless. But I managed to get them together last Sunday and secured a vote to remain in the Methodist Church until the new church can be made ready. The church with a small spot of ground adjoining cost $2,000. It is well situated and I should judge was about 60 X 35 ft in size Last night they held the last \"Fair\" to pay for the church, It was held in an old building used as a store house for carriages, in which preaching has been given on Sundays, since the Methodist church was left They have raised some $300 think by the fair, and $200 by subscription among the white people of the place. I took occasion to address the most happy audience upon which I ever looked in my life, at the fair, upon the duty of reviving their \"Benevolent Society\" and taking care of their own poor,-- as God was blessing them. It was well received. I mean to connect an industrial school with it, when they yet reorganized.',\n",

       " 'p025_028': 'I have the honor to submit the following report, upon the General condition of Bureau affairs in the 7th and 8th Dists Department of Va. (as late constituted) made in conformity to Special Orders no. 121 C.S. Bureau R.F. and A.L. Headquarters Asst Comr Dept of Va. dated August 4th 1866. . . . . . . Counties of Augusta, Highland & Bath. These counties constitute a sub district under charge of Lieut. G. T. Cook V.R.C. as Asst. Supt.. The freedmen are generally engaged at labor but do not appear to be in a prosperous or contented position. Lt. Cook makes grave complaints against the local magistrates for their utter indifference and inattention to the complaints of the freedmen, who come before them, especially where such complaints are made against whites. Reports of outrages are frequent, and almost invariably the freedmen are the sufferers, with but little if any chance of redress. When the attention of the magistrates is specially called to a case, and it is at the same time intimated to them by Lieut. Cook that any refusal or delay on their part to act promptly in the matter, will necessitate a reference of the matter to the Asst. Commissioner, they will act, but generally their action amounts to nothing more than to bind both parties over to keep the peace, the innocent with the guilty, the aggressor with the victim. Lieut. Cook does however, report one instance in which the magistrates protected an outraged freed-girl and bound some white citizens over to answer to the grand-jury for a gross assault upon her. Justice to freedmen is however here, the exception and not the rule. Circular No. 7 Bureau RF & AL Washington DC. [unclear: I] inquired of Lt. Cook as to what inquiry the Freedmen were making in the matter of Lands in certain states offered to them by the provisions of the Act of Congress approved June 21st 1866 and in regard to which information has been [unclear: promulgated] in Circular No 7 Headquarters Commissioner Bureau R.F. and A.L. and in reply he informed me that he had not received the circular and knew nothing of its provisions. Marriage register The registry for the county of Augusta had been completed, before the arrival of the blanks distributed for that purpose. I examined it and found it complete with the exception that it did not furnish the names of the former owners of either husband or wife. The Asst Superintendent was convinced that it would be impossible even to get the Freedmen together again, for the purpose of completing the record and in consequence, I directed him to copy his present registry numerically upon the blanks, [unclear: trusting] to time and opportunity to make it gradually more complete. The calling of these people together for the purpose of registry has had an excellent and noticeable effect upon them, especially in imbuing them with a greater respect for the marriage relation that they have heretofore had. Support of Destitutes The county authorities of Augusta county have made proper arrangements for the support of the poor, and expect and intend to provide for all \"freedmen paupers\" who are properly thrown upon them. In Highland and Bath counties similar provision has been made. So far as Bath County is concerned, it has been but lately added to this sub district: and the officer in charge has as yet had no opportunity of examining into the condition of the freedmen therein. The slave population of the county in 1860, was but small, while in Higland County it was still less. The official records of this office are in good condition, books are well kept, so far as furnished, and all orders, letters &c properly filed. Lieut. Cook appears to be a competent officer and successful in the discharge of his duties. . . . . . . In this as in the 7th I found such of the officers as I said men of more than average ability and discretion.',\n",

       " 'p008_007': 'Your long and interesting letter was received yesterday evening and perused with the greatest pleasure. Indeed I do owe you many thanks for your punctuality in writing and for your long letters; they assist very much to relieve the monotony of camp life, but even that reason for appreciating them is small when compared with that of cultivating the friendship of one whom I love so much, though a recent acquaintance. But \"time is measured by heart throbs not by figures on a dial\". I am sorry that I am compelled to write with a pencil. I know that in going so far it must become very dimm, but it is almost impossible to procure ink and pens which will write, so that it has become an almost universal custom in the army--and I believe with soldiers at other places to write with a pencil. We are now encamped about six miles from Leesburg, eight from home and about half that from the enemy. At preasant we are living next door to a cornfield and of course live very well, as the owner is a patriotic Southerner and has given us full permission to pull and eat. Besides this my cousin and myself have a nice little box in one corner of our tent which is usually plentifully supplied with provisions from home. So you see as we have a private tent, made at home for us we live quite pleasantly and do not stand so much in and of your sympathies as you supposed. All this is very fine but I can\\'t tell how long it will last we were ordered this morning to pack our knapsacks and be ready to march at a moment\\'s warning, so by to- morrow we may be down on the river without either tent or bed other than one blanket. We have one company of howitzers attached to our Brigade, two of the pieces are here with our regiment and the other two have been down on the river for the last three days during which time they have fired upwards of a hundred rounds and killed a good many of the Yankees. One field officer was seen to fall dead after a fire on yesterday. When we cannot get provisions from home our fare is so bad that it is almost impossible to eat it unless near starvation. We can get enough grease by skimming the coffee to oil our boots, and the bread is much worse than the coffee. War is unpleasant, we all wish it over, but nevertheless I have seen very few soldiers who will not volunteer again when the time of their enlistment has expired. You ask if I do not think a just God will forgive those who kill the enemies of the South. I believe we need no forgiveness for ridding the earth of such as in defiance of justice and religion attempt to  the chains of slavery upon our glorious country. I think I could say like Pendleton after pointing his guns, \"God have mercy on their sinful souls, and may this volley kill a thousand; fire boys\". Indeed I long to begin the march to Washington. Thousands of Marylanders would flock to our standard if once we could cross the river. That ever brave little state has already sent over many to assist in the defence of Virginia\\'s Soil and when fighting in their own land in defence of their homes how many more might we expect to join us. Kentucky alone has [unclear: deceive] me and acted the coward. The degenerate sons have disgraced their illustrious sires; may they soon repent and turn. Tennessee the old \"volunteer state\" has not changed and the Yankees will find that her sons are as brave now as when in Mexico the retreating  formed behind them. But I fear I shall weary even you with writing about the war; few persons would have had the patience to read even this much. We heard not long since from our Orderly Sergeant, who was taken prisoner in the battle of Manassa, he is confined in the capitol and treaded very kindly. I know you cannot wish more heartily than I do that I could be in Augusta once more. I know, with you for a guide and companion, I could never weary of rambling over that beautiful county. I am devoted to horseback riding and then with such company--it really makes me dissatisfied with camp life to think of its depriving me of such pleasure as that. But Bobby Burns says that \"man was made to mourn\" and the best way to obviate the necessity of always wearing a long face is to learn to bear disappointments with resignation. I received a letter from Chum a day or two after I last wrote to you and wrote him a long one in return. The evening you last wrote I was not on duty. I do not remember the dreams of that night but I can assure you that among my sleeping and waking fancies no form, oftener ads joy to the picture, than that of a lady in Mt. Solon. Two nights after you wrote I was on duty. I was very unwell and it was a dark, rainy night. No soft moon smiled on me, as I relieved the weary sentinels, to remind me of an absent dear one; but the dismal pattering of the rain accorded with the dull aching of my head and the despondency of my spirits. Then I could hardly believe any one cared for me, even now I can not imagine any one dreaming of me. You say that \"you would freely die to save the life of one soldier\". Who is that happy one? I will not tell. Confide in me. Does Georgia number him among her brave sons? From wherever he may hail he is the most fortunate of men. There is the drum for Battalion drill and Dress Parade so you must excuse me for two hours.  Well Dress Parade is over at last and although supper is ready, it has not enough attraction to make me postpone any longer the conclusion of my little \"chat\" with you. The Battalion Drill is the hardest thing we have here, and as left guide of the company I have to notice all the time as the Major has an especial spite against me and is always trying to find some fault if possible. One of my great objections to camp life is the total disregard of Sunday. In fact our Sunday drills are generally the hardest for then we have so many visitors that the officers try to show off and nearly kill us in the attempt. You speak of the difference between Northern and Southern treatment of private citizens. This is especially marked in our Regiment, we are encamped at present in a union neighborhood, where most of the inhabitants are abolitionists and yet although secessionists have been robbed and driven from their homes only a few miles from here we take not a cent\\'s worth without offering the cash for it. I shall write to you as often as possible that is if I do not think I could weary you. And please remember at the same time that nothing can give me greater pleasure than receiving your kind long letters as frequently as possible. An ambrotypist came to Leesburg last week and I was able to get a picture to leave with Ma if I am killed. I have been wishing for some time to get a good one for her and although this is not very good it will serve to recall to her mind how I looked as a soldier. Now you see I have written you the longest letter I have mailed for a long time and written punctually too, So you will greatly oblige me by following my good example.',\n",

I have the honor to submit the following report of condition of Bureau affairs in this 4th Div of 9th Sub.Dist. Va. The election held on the 22nd of October passed quietly at all the Districts in this county (Augusta) and the excitement consequent on this [unclear: canvass] has postponed much of the ordinary business of this office. There was excellent order at all the places of voting, but since the election there has been a most outrageous attempt to deter freedmen from voting again except they vote as ordered by their masters. Owing in a great measure to this, contracts have not been so frequent the last half of this month. The circumstances of Freedmen, as a rule, are comfortable but those with families realize but little over a base subsistence. There are many applications for relief by aged and helpless freedpeople and when the time comes, I shall endeavor to have the county authorities provide proper maintenance for deserved poor. The Social relations between white and colored have not become more amicable by the recent election, but I advise patience and forbearance on the part of Freedmen and they refrain almost entirely from discussion. Politically the whites have compelled the freedmen to take sides against them. The Conservative candidates openly proclaimed their opposition to education, franchise or elevation for the Colored men and of course they naturally voted for the Republicans who were willing they should enjoy these privileges. The Moral condition of the Freedmen is not as it should be but education for the young will in time bear good fruit. I am unable to report any temperance organization as yet among the Freedmen but there is much less drunkeness than a few months back and when the political excitement has subsided I may succeed in forming a branch society of the Lincoln Temperance Association.',\n",

I was unwell at the time, consequently was left behind to take care of the baggage in company with three or four others who were in a like condition. Our company was one of the 4. they took the cars at Stephenson's Depot which is within a few hundred yards of our camp. from thence they went to Charlestown, where they stayed a day. from thence they marched through Shepards Town on to the dam which was for the time to be the scene of action. They had two pieces of the Rockbridge Artillery with them for the purpose of scaling the walls. But oweing to the fact of their being so many Yankees on the opposite shore, & the almost impossibility of breaking the dam, they returned to martinsburg (bringing with them 8 prisoners - Consisting of 1 Capt, 2 Srgts & 5 Privates.

The anniversary of the  Graham Society [2] came off on last night.  It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight  that there was a large crowd.  The anniversary address was delivered by Mr.  Paxton of Rockbridge.[3] It was a very good  address, well written and very well delivered.  The question, \"If Turkey fails to protect her  Christians should nations interfere\" was then  discussed by four other members of Society,  whose names it is not necessary to mention.  All the front of the college was illuminated  and made a very pretty appearance.  The people of this county held a meeting at  the Court house, Monday to nominate candidates  for the convention which resulted in the nomi- nation of S McD Moore and James Dorman, two strong Union men, so that if the  question of Virginia\\'s secession depends upon  their votes, she wont go out soon. Who are candidates in Augusta?[4]  From all I can hear, I think that the  secessionists are rapidly gaining ground  in Virginia, and would not be surprised if  that convention should declare Virginia out  of the Union. From present appearances it  seems that we are almost sure to have civil war.  There are such extensive military preparations  going on in the north and from the threatening  and insulting way in which the Republican  papers and from the overbearing and  contemptuous actions [unclear: ]  of Congress in refusing compromises giving  the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln\\'s intention to compel the South  to remain in the Union, if he can.  And if he attempts that, the whole South  will and ought to unite and oppose it.  A week or two ago, a few of the boys secretly  made and hoisted upon top of College  a Disunion Flag, bearing a single red star and  the word Disunion. But Dr. Junkin very  soon had it taken down and there has  been nothing said about disunion since.[5]  Yesterday was warm and clear, but now it  is cold and snowing. I never saw weather  so changeable, or so much rain, or so many  cloudy and foggy days in my life as we  have had here. It is hardly ever clear three  days at one time.

Altho\\' the $17 for which you have applied for rent if received will aid the work, yet by reference to the acc\\'t presented Mr Whiting you will perceive that it is already paid by the freedmen, for last month. I have also secured from them the rent for the present month ending the 12th of May. It will be more difficult to collect it next month, tho\\' I think we can get it. I have used the utmost exertions to save expense and the money raised for rent has been entirely distinct from that paid for tuition and has not diminished that at all.  The actual rent is only $10. per month, the other $7. which I included was for expense for fitting up the house,--seats desks etc. I do not think the school expensive, considering that we had to rent both a school room and dwelling house, The actual cost above the sale of books for board and all aside from salaries, being from the 23rd of Nov to the first of Apr. only $6.22/100 to the A.M.A.--for three teachers and the education of 300 pupils. We are now paying for board about $11.00 per week for all, and the freedmen raise 5. As to the question how soon we can close the schools without injury to the work! \"I would say that it would in my opinion, be really for the interest of the people, in this comparatively cool country to hold the schools as long as we can; for the following reasons 1st As we now have room, and books, the schools are doing better than at any time before. 2nd An early close will deprive the younger pupils, who have not been able to attend thro\\' the winter, of any chance of education. 3rd As the people already complain of the long vacations made by northern teachers, they will be likely to attempt to set up schools themselves and so desire to controll them or by Autumn to make it difficult for any northern teacher to again get possession. 4th The opposition seems to have subsided, or our schools have passed beyond the controll of those who would injure them These are the reasons for continuing the school. There are other considerations, that might be used in favor of a speedy close.  1st Should a teacher be sent to remain all summer, that would answer all the reasons given above in favor of continuing the school, and it might be closed very soon. 2nd We are all weary, having put forth unusual effort to keep up our school against opposition and without convenience 3rd An early departure might call the people to their senses as \"blessings brighten as they take their flight\" and we might add that the house in which we have been having been sold, we are not very conveniently or at least desirably situated for warm weather, tho\\' we do not complain. There are three times on which we can close our school with no injury to the work already done, provided you inform us two or three weeks beforehand so as to give us time to conduct our \"Reviews\" in the classes. 1st On the 15th of May when the rent paid expires 2nd On the 1st of June, and I prefer to remain no longer than that if it please you,-- tho\\' perhaps the ladies would remain longer yet they would not like to do so after my departure 3rd The ladies had half fixed the time on the 15th of June, but read your letter of inquiry indicating an earlier close; with much interest and even pleasure, Should you think best to close soon what shall we do with the few articles of beding--Sell them?

       " 'p023_002': 'In your blanks for Supt\\'s you say that you expect those who act as such to, speak frankly concerning the efficiently qualifications of teachers under their charge I therefore deem it proper both to make some statements and some inquiries. When our school was organized there were 4 of us teachers in the day school and 5 in the night, (the matron the 5th) and all in one building. Harmony of plan and action was necessary And the teachers called on me to act as Supt. And though I had no commission from you to that effect, except a single remark that \"you placed these ladies under my care\" as we left New York, yet being the only gentleman teacher, and finding that I had had more experience than the rest I felt it a duty to accept; especially as Mr Coan favored the arrangement. The teachers were, and are now glad, to receive my suggestions, with (I am sorry to say) the exception of one (Miss Dewey). And in our councils we respect the opinion of each other and move in harmony mostly Mrs Dunn is an admirable teacher, a very rapid workman, and a good disciplinarian, and excellent musician. Miss Williams is not as good in governing but is very kind and can communicate well. She is better counsel in regard to measures (outside of the school) for the general improvement of the freedmen, than she is teacher, but she is efficient at that, and very industrious in her labors. Mrs Tukey the matron of our Mission House is very useful in the night school. Miss Dewey keeps quite a good school, but evidently has had but little experience, and I think lacks in consideration of the bearing of this or that measure upon different classes--or in a careful study of the way things are working. She therefore opposes many measures very needful for the good of the school. She opposed the change of classes from one room to another necessary for the grading of the school, both night and day, She also felt unwilling to exchange rooms so as to let the largest school into the largest room. And when Miss Dunn returned from Lexington tried without my knowledge at the time to keep her from retaking her own school, and had been quite dictatorial in her bearing in many respects remarking that \"I have always had my own way and always mean to\" Mr. Tukey suggested that I speak to Mr Coan about it and ask if he intended me as Supt here--I did so, and was advised to act as such by all means, and upon hearing the state of the case (as he had previously heard it from Mr Tukey I presume) he advised me to remain although he had that morning ordered me up to Lexington to se how that school was working under Mr Johnstone and McLean, And I expected to spend Christmas week there, as their school did not stop. After informing Miss Dewey that under Mr Tukeys advice I had spoken to Mr Coan, and telling her the result of the conversation, she agreed to conform to my wishes, in every thing pertaining to school matters and has indeed reformed. But if you wish me to carry out Mr Coans suggestions and act as Local Supt, if you would write me that fact, and also inform Miss Dewey of the same, without bringing to her knowledge anything of these statements, I have no doubt but that you would much help me and the work, and save me and the other teachers some unnecessary words, as they are generally ready to coincide with me, in explaining to Miss Dewey the propriety of any proposed measure. She is unnecessarily strong in her denunciations of Rebels \"Not wishing to meet them in heaven\" \"Nor that any of the South who had anything to do with the War should be saved.\" And while we were on board the Steamer Albermarle, on our way here she used such severe terms as to attract the attention of Southern men on the Steamer and would have hightened prejudice against us very much had we been going to stay in Richmond where these people were to stop She told a gentleman who came here the other day that \"You are worms under our feet\"  My opinion is that we should be more successful by gentlemanly treatment than by that which borders upon incivility, and perhaps a remark addressed to Miss Dewey from you would not do harm on the subject and might do good  Please answer soon although there is nothing demanding any immediate or severe action, indeed I think we shall not have much more trouble.

They are going to have some tableaux too. I expect it will be as good as going to the minastrel and better too as that is all sham and this will be the real article. I have picked out three pieces for some of my boys to speak and that is all I have had to do with it. I wrote a letter to Roland to-day and am going to try and write him oftener in the future as I shall have more time now. Mr Cristy wote me a nice long letter the other day telling me all about Alberts conversion. They must be very glad and I hope he will make a true earnest christian. Here is the poetry James Tynell had in his composition. The \"title\" of the composition was this, where he got it from I am sure I do not know, \"Who ought to have the credit Columbus or Washington? Columbus for settling discovering it or Washington for settling it.\" He took the side of Columbus, I copied the whole thing and will bring it home with me, it is a great curiousity. Here is the poetry I will write it on the top of the first page. Try and get well and write me a nice long letter,',\n",

I cannot express my thanks in writing for the nice box you sent me also for the 10$ you sent me for Xmas gift. The examination commences today. I think I will get through very well if I do not get confused, but as I was never examined in public before. I feel allmost certain that I will get through on Geography & French. If they examine me by asking me questions I dont think I will get through but if he gives me examples I think I will get through on Math. I am determined to commence this year by doing my duty as well as I can in every thing. We only had one day Christmas and I was very glad of it. I thought of home so that I did not enjoy my self Xmas day. I was thinking all day about the deaths of poor Henry & Elsy and about the sickness at home since I left. Things will be so much altered when I get home so I cannot enjoy myself at all. There is no enjoyment to be seen now no how. Lexington has done more for the soldiers than any place I know for the size of it. They gave nearly 5 hundred carpet blankets to them besides giving 3 theatrical performances & the cadets gave a kind of negro show for their benefit. The show given by the cadets cleared 3 hundred dollars. The ladies made about 600 hundred dollars in all of their performances. I was invited to the Misses Baxters Monday night to tea and was introduced to 4 young ladies. I was never as much confused in my life as I was when they entered the room. I had been in the house nearly an hour when they came in and I was not expecting them atall as I had been there so long. We had a splendid supper, had muffins, chipped ham, biscuit, tea & coffee, . I did not enjoy myself much as they were all perfect strangers to me.  Tell Uncle Archer if he has not hired out all of the servants yet that General Smith would like to get 3 of them for waiters in the hall and will give $175 for them and you cloth them. They would not be exposed atall as all they have to do is to wait in the Hall. Write to me soon and let me know how Maurice and [unclear: Tru] are getting. I was so glad to hear that Maurice is entirely out of danger. When he was so sick and I did not hear from home for so long and I tried to get a furlough and couldn't get one I thought I would desert several times. I hope he is well enough to walk about now. Tell him I will answer his letter next. Give my best love to Aunt Sarah and thank her for the nice ham she sent me. Tell her that I answered her letter as soon as I received it and have not heard a word from her since. Tell Molly I think she might write to me some time. When you write again send me some stamps as we cannot get any here. I have just been examined on Geography and got through with out a blunder. Write and let me know whether the two lame horses will ever be any account & how Nanny is looking. I would like to take the Lynchburg Virginian this year as I never hear any news here at all. Tis nearly time for dress parade and I want to put this in the male tonight. Give my love to Miss Laura when you see her. Good by\",\n",
       " 'p040_010': 'I arrived one week ago to night, went into Sabbath school next morning and after finding out from the Colored preacher that he had intended to commence day school next morning and after a little preliminary arrangement I gave notice that I would commence school Monday morning. So I have been teaching all the week not losing a moment since my arrival. The colored minister is a man of much pomp and arrogance who charged me with incivility in not informing them of my intended arrival immediately previous to my coming pretending that such information would have better enabled them to prepare for my coming and board. But really he is a little sorry that I take from him the privelege of teaching as he hoped thus to get a little change. He was soon reconciled by the overwhelming manifestation of attachment to me on the part of his people Yet he would not consent to let the school have the body of the rough little church for such unholy purposes as the education of children He said that Brackett came there a few days ago and would have left teachers but as he would not consent to a schools being held there \"Brackett went on with high head to Lexington with his teachers\" So I went down into the damp basement to begin my work by confidently expect to go up higher ere the winter is out Indeed should a lady come to help me I have but little doubt but the body of the church can be obtained The Trustees are in favor of it, and the Bureau agt has used his utmost endeavor to secure it. I have already 55 day and 40 night scholars and dare not speak on the subject of Education or visit the people at their houses for fear of an irrepressible inundation of black children in the school room Therefore \"Come over into Macedonia and help us.\"--or Send us immediately some amiable self denying christian woman to this beautiful country--to these poor people. I have as yet had but two night schools as the room is under the church, and I would not attempt to teach under a noisy meeting. I pleaded with this preacher for an abandonment of a few of his religious meetings to give the people a time and a place to learn to read All the people seem to be convinced that it is for their interest to come to school four nights in the week They are mostly young people who compose his congregation He still stands out with dogged semi-religious obstinacy. But he will give way soon I think. Indeed I have no doubt of it. When I was here before there were 400 children in our schools, and the Editor of the principal paper here told me to day that there is about 1600 colored people here in town and there are but two little petty schools beside my own each having only about 25 scholars Therefore it is a fair presumption that there will be work for two teachers beside myself here. But I hope you will send one as soon as convenient I intend to ransack the town next week and bring out men women and children to school looking for help to teach I can obtain colored Assistants by the score but I have not found any yet who are competent to help much and none who are willing to join a normal class and prepare for making teaching a business and to encourage any others it seems to me will only sanction these little private schools which are taught or rather kept by ignorant teachers, and which rather stand in the way of education than act as an aid to it One of the candidates for the position of Assistant wants me to pay him $25. per month He can read some but not correctly. (Ignorance!) I have written to Mr Brackett to send me a circular containing the Course of study at the normal School; at Harpers Ferry hoping to so set before these aspirants the necessity of preparation as to prevent their all turning teachers instant The people pay my board by a ten cent per week tax. They will I think pay the board of a teacher if you send one. All the expense then it would seem will be a little house rent that not over $20. for the term. I have bargained for a house in view of a coming teacher and the colored man and his wife are to remain--she as cook--and he\\'l be handy They are neat people. It is where the teachers have lived before. The Children have not advanced as they should in the time The feeling of the whites toward this work is encouraging. Much better then formerly. Men that once did not recognize me, now always speak and I am taken cordially by the hand where I least expected it Men whom I had forgotten now call me by name and appear friendly Compliments and Expressions of desire for success in this work reach me from time to time in a round about way so that I know that the old prejudice is in a measure gone. The school is very much in want of Books. I sent to Chaplain Manly of Richmond to see if he would not furnish. He says the government does not do it now and I feel obliged to send to you for some--but will make the order as small as possible. I think the people here will pay for every book. I really want a set of outline maps There is but a fragment of one or two here and there all smoked up--but I dare not order them. The Readers formerly used here were Saunders and were good, but the higher numbers of Wilsons have been introduced so that I think best to send for a few of Wilsons also. I have written to my friend E C  in the city hoping he may send me a clock in the same box with the books. It is now monday morning. I had a new experience last night. I asked the colored minister to give notice in church of my night school He roughly turned to me and replied \"They\\'ll find it out fast enough\"--and refused either give the notice to his congregation, or to allow me to do it; This is unaccountable.

The First Classmen held a meeting and refused to recite and then all of the classes refused and they appointed a committee to visit the Superintendent and he suspended all duty for the day.  I will answer Brother Jim's letter in a day or two if I have time. Write me how every thing is going on on the place and how the lame horses are getting along. Write me how the carriage horses look and how Nannie and Annie look. I would like to see how every thing is going on the farm now.

By the blessing of God the Lecture was a success, and the children again flock to the school in new platoons You inform me that you have shipped bedding--This is kind, yet you remember that in my last letter I stated that I had made arrangements so that I would get along someway--but it will be handy to have the beding Last Saturday I road 30 miles in the rain to see about that Mt Solon School--but as the people only get together on Sunday there was no opportunity of setting any arrangement by which to secure the proposed $10. per month. But I left it in shape for the people to do on sunday, and they agreed to send me word yesterday morning but it did not come.

The fuel required will be absolutely essential to the existence of many Freedmen and at this moment there is very great suffering which might and ought to be relieved by the issue of fuel in small quantities, and which my previous estimates if approved, would have enabled me to do so. The wagons are really necessary and would have been asked for before, but for my earnest desire to avoid unnecessary expense, and the hope that the local Quartermasters would be able to supply all needs. Such is not the case, their transportation being insufficient for their ordinary wants, leaving the business of the Bureau to suffer through their helplessness.

Snowing, freezing & raining, about every other day; the weather & roads together has been the cause of our remaining so quietly for the past month the roads are in such a condition at present that it would be impossible for an army to move. Hope they may continue so for some time to come, so that some of our boys may get home on furlough. They are granting to two in each company at present.

       " 'p023_043': 'I received your letter two or three days weeks ago and it made me feel so badly that I did not know what to answer ; and when our good Mr Coan came through here on his way home I exclaimed \"The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof\", has gone, and what is there left! And when still further I saw from the Secretaries letter of dismissal, the astonishing statement that the schools in the Shenandoah valley \"Are not as promising as in other places  aghast! As to the removal of Mr Coan I have nothing to say except that, he was beloved by all, and of great value in counsel, and the fact that in 6 mo (I think) there will be more than double the number of scholars in school, or in want of school in this valley that there now is makes his removal of doutful propriety, at this time in my mind Children are being brought within range of school influence as fast as they can be. Parents are hiring them boarded or moving to places where schools are kept and there are many little towns that are getting hold of the fact that you require 50 scholars at least to begin a school, or supply a teacher and they are trying to see if the no. is to be made up. Two of our day schools have more than doubled since New Years day; and now number over 60 scholars each and the others, one 55 and the other 45 making 224 scholars for 4 teachers, and packing our rooms in every nook and corner. But you are presumed to know best about this removal. As to the statement that the schools in the Valley are not as promising as others so far as it relates to Staunton,-- I deny its truth. I have been connected with schools at the north for about 10 years, and have seen as many schools as most men of my age, and studied them as carefully; and a more promising school than this I never saw, and do not believe such could exist in the nature of circumstances. It is promising 1rst as to numbers. Out of a population of 800 freedmen 434 attend school; and not much over 1/3 of them are adults, and as the season for work is coming on the proportion of children will be still greater. And of those who are adults they are mostly young men and women. When warm weather comes many a barefoot will step out of the cabin and in to the school room to enjoy the same blessing that the older brother and sister have during the cold weather But it is promising as to the deportment of the children Behold 400 colored persons passing quietly through the streets, treating whites with civility, performing school requirements with military exactness,-- many of them going quietly to S School on Sunday--and all dressed as well as  dress and   to cleanliness Compare this state of things with what it was 4 months ago when there was no school. Could a more noisy set of rowdies be found than these boys They were idle ignorant and vile. Often insulting the white citizens with taunts, feeling the Yankee bayonets would protect them They knew no Sunday, many of them except as a holy day, and many of the children looked as much like young monkeys from the rill swamp of Bengal as like human beings  then ask the honored Lee of the A. M. A. if he can deny that it is \"promising\" But further the schools of Staunton are promising in regard to Education I hope to be able next month to send you a sample of writing by some of my scholars 40 of whom 4 months ago could not write a word nor scarcely read one;-- but who will be able to write their own letters in a month from now not elegantly but legibly. Others have learned that the world turnes around something also of latitude and longitude  and the location of countries in general, in a word have thoroughly begun geography. The same is true of Arithmetic Many who 4 months ago could not tell one figure from another can now begin to add, subtract, and some to multiply. Now even this is an invaluable treasure to them. But again The moral condition of the Freedmen is promising When we came here only about 25 or 30 came to the Sunday school and an inveterate dissention had sprung up among them that  moved into our new school house--that is the Colored church and thereby save you 225 per year. Secondly the current expenses of the school such as for lights and fuel and the little necessaries which are in the aggregate quite an expense and many of which came into your bill from Ms Tukey--these - are all now paid by the people themselves Thirdly I do not see any more need of books or lamps or anything of much cost from the rooms \"at present.\" Fourthly Mr Tukey remarked to me that the little room adjoining the house now is  and allow you whatever it might be as it is used properly by the government And he further remarked that while he thought $20 per month not exhorbitant for board (including washing) since he furnished the mission house (with furniture crockery etc.) yet now as the sum named has been paid he would try boarding at $4.00 per week including washing This is certainly as cheep as any man can do it as they charge $40.00 for the cheapest board at the Hotels and much cheaper than you could run any other kind of mission house--that is  own the furniture yourself  in actual service in the school room could not stand the extra work of Matronship or housekeeping--in my opinion--and the teachers concur. I hope that these improvements may so mitigate expense that you may feel safe in continuing the school. There is some doubt about our holding this house much longer, and in case we should not I see no way but to go into colored families to board for I dont believe another house can be rented for \"Nigger Teachers\" That arrangement would perhaps be cheaper still but not desirable especially for ladies. The church is not so convenient or comfortable --but we must endure all things There are but two windows in that large building and when it is cloudy we have to light a lamp or two, Mr Tukey has paid over $75.00 out of his own pocket to fit up the church this far, and with no security whatever. And so ignorant are these people of the fact and nature of public responsibility, that it is hard work to get money even to buy lights and wood The schools are hardly as efficient or as successful as they were in the separate rooms as some confusion occurs, and we can not magnetize our classes with animated exercises, as we could, but we are doing well and making progress. John Scott  threatened to destroy the sunday school But with much labor and ingenuity union has been secured, and a large and flourishing S School, of 144 scholars and 8 teachers is now in operation, 1/8 of which can read so well that I shall soon send for a news paper for them. The low meaningless songs so common among the colored people are supplanted, and a new song put into their mouths even those of Bradbury from the \"Chain Shows\" and \"Censer\" These hyms are their common songs, you can hear them on the street in the cabin and everywhere. If the oft quoted expression--\"Let me make the songs of a country and I care not  who makes  then we have affected something by this means. Now while we have 1/2 the entire population attending our schools While we can point to this improvement in deportment, and this advancement in education, and improvement in morals--in view of these facts will any man say that our schools \"Are not promising\" Has heaven blessed another field under your care more or even as much Finally in regard to mitigating expenses. In your last letter to me you almost threaten to discontinue the schools if these were cut down. You have no idea of the  Mr Tukey has saved you more than $100.00 The stoves 4 in number would have cost $80.00 here if we had had to buy those that would have answered the purpose as well Nor can a dwelling house be turned into a school house without work. Long before you are up I am at work. I rise at a little after 5 in the morning and work til 100 at night. I have built doors, benches, blackboards, windows, dug drains, cut wood,  locks, etc. etc. This I do in addition to teaching, looking after wood lights and all the necessaries managing the S School, writing letters for the colored people making calls and assisting the pastor in his writing and otherwise . I do not get time to write letters to my family, or to read the papers Had the mere carpenter work that I have done been hiered it would have been quite a bill of expense. There is scarcely a day that I do not have to do more or less worke of that kind and often stay in my school room all the after noon, sometimes not even coming to supper. But you ask if we can \"not run this machine cheaper\" I am happy to tell you that we are now running it cheeper than it has been run heretofore I say now I mean since the 15th of Feb--Firstly we have [several words unclear] by some one hear which has robbed me of over $50.00 and I cant get any trace of the offender, but some one has got a good coat and a handsome Revolver to say nothing of other small things. I can get board in colored families for at least 4.00 per week but in the warm weather which is upon us it would be rather musty Do you recommend it.

       " 'p008_010': \"We had a very agreeable ride to Richmond, and made a stay in that City till Saturday morning, when we started South. We were very much indebted to Cap. Baldwin, for making our time as pleasant in Richmond as it was thro his politeness & attention, we were able to see the manufacture of war instruments, from the percussion cap & minie ball, up to the Dalgreen gun & rifled Cannon. Ellen had a very pressing invitation to spend her time in the country a few miles down Jame's River, and I was very near availing myself of it & pay a visit to Manassas on Saturday, which would have [unclear: enabled] me to see the great fight of the 21st. But having no suspicion that another battle would have followed so soon the one of the 18th, & not having heard from Home and the cotton gathering season with in a few days, I unfortunately left on Saturday morning. We had a long tedious trip to orleans -- so much detention from long trains of Cars loaded with Soldiers, that we were detained in Bristol all day on Sunday, and [unclear: delayed] another day in Loudon from a wash in the road caused by the horrid rains I had seen fall for some time. The Battle of Manassas had preceded us of course, and the war fever was raging along the road in N. Orleans and at Home, with ten fold more violence than when I left. I found a Boat in Orleans ready for the mouth of the Red River, from which plain we took steps for Alexandria, and reached home within two hours of three weeks from the time I left. I found the crops of corn & cotton any thing we would desire--the first enough to bread us for two years in a pinch & the latter promising an abundant yield. But for the last two weeks we have a [unclear: suspicion] of rain that rarely falls in our Summers--bringing in their  too, two of the most destructive pests that the Crop is subject to--Boll worm & Cotton [unclear: pitter]. Several of my neighbors are now complaining that their crops are half eaten up. I see very few in mine yet. We have also had Typhoid Fever all around us, but have escaped yet, th'o Robert thinks we had two cases among the servants while I was about. We have had & are now having a great deal of little [unclear: fever] among our field hands, only lasting two or three days, but interferes very much with our Cotton picking. One planter on Bayou Bocuffe had forty to come in on one day. The War Spirit is not abating, but burns as brightly as ever, Companies are mustering or passing down [unclear: every week]--With a voting population of about 1400 our Parish has sent of eight companies & now raising a Battalion of Horse.

As well might the Indian & the White man live together as equals as the Southern & the Yankee. The Huguenot is the same now he was in the time of Henry the 4th brave, faithful & religious & the Cavalier the same bold, [unclear: unchanaged], high toned gentleman, as when he fought & gave his life for Charles the 1st.

With a climate comprising nearly all the degrees of the temperate zone, from the region of the apple to the orange; from that of the hemp to the wheat, to the cotton & sugar, with mountains containing all of the minerals of the world, to the plains covered with cattle in countless herds, with an excess of surplus of Cotton Sugar & Tobacco alone of 300000000 and a people as brave & chivalrous as the Romans in the height of fame, why should we not be the greatest people in the world? Could there be a more significant sign & more illustrative of the two races, than the horrors of the present Northern cabinet--Abraham, Simon, Gideon, Solomon, Caleb, and Hannibal--five parts Puritan & one Affrican. I hope our patriotic women may be able to clothe our whole army with woolens for the winter--it would be an honor that no other nation [unclear: can] attend to.

I went down & took dinner with Ed Waddell today. He is looking very well but has a right sore foot. There is 15000 soldiers here. At night I can look out of my window & can see the camp fires all over the hills. There is about 250 tents besides the houses are all very near full of soldiers. There is 3500 Mississippi troops here about 2000 Alabamers 600 Kentuckians. They have 40 or 50 cannon here & more are coming today. They have a large 32 pounder station above the Powder Magazine which commands the Railroad. It will shoot 5 miles. You know where it is. I saw John Hill & Claire Evans. They are both well. Tell Mr. Evans George is not here. Tell Pa John Lipscomb sent him a gun by James Patrick & some cartridges by William M Bush. I forgot to tell you that the 1st night I got here we were ordered under arms at two oclock but by the time we were ready we got orders to go to bed. I dont think there will be any fighting here. When we were in Martinsburg I took some dispatches down to Col Allen's Camp who is encamped in the woods 13 1/2 miles of the Potomac River. The next morning I went down to the River to wash my face & I could see Williamsport very plain. There is a lot of Maryland soldiers come on & joined our Army. How are you all getting on. How is Clinton pleased with clerking. I will write Hugh a letter on the other side. Write soon give my love to all. I was vaccinated the other day & it has begun to make my arm sore. I will go to Shepherdstown as soon as I can & stay a day. If you send me anything direct it care of Capt Patrick Valley Rangers. How are you getting on with your garden. Ma send me some ham pickles biscuit pies & you know what to send. I will stop as I have written you a very long letter. Tell Pa the cartridges must be torn off at the end & the paper taken off the ball it will fit loose but will spread when shot from the gun. Give my love to all. Write soon. Tell Charles I will write to him in a few days. I am taking good care of myself. Kiss Hugh Ginny & Betty for me.\",\n",
       " 'p011_048': \" I got a letter from you while I was in Frederick City; the first one for a long time then that I recd. from home; since then, as before, we have been going, going, and I have not found time to write, though I have often thought of it. I wrote to you, I think, soon after the Manassa fight, then we crossed into Maryland and took a turn and came back to Martinsburg and then went to Harpers Ferry and captured it, with the large stores etc. there, an account of which you have seen, then we came back up the river and fought the hotly contested battle of Sharpsburg in which no decided advantage remained with either side, though we gained the day on each wing, but Gen. McClaws failed to attack, as ordered, in the centre, and so no results came from our advantage, though we held the field of battle all the next day and buried our dead and collected our wounded, and then retired unmolested across the river during the night of the 18th. The next night a large force of the enemy came across and routed our picket on the bank and took 4 pieces of artillery, but Gen. Jackson went down in the morning and sent them howling back, killing some 500 of them; since then all has been quiet. We moved our camp to near Martinsburg, and have been there until yesterday when we moved up here to find a better camp, foraging, etc. This country is almost destitute of every kind of forage or subsistence, for it has been full of armies for a long time. It is quite dry here too, though the people have been sending some. I could not buy anything in Maryland for the want of Maryland money, as we did not oblige them to take Confederate money, leaving every one to their own choice. I bought 20 yards of fulled cloth in Charlestown, some of which I intend for the servants, but will have to have some clothes for myself off it. When we are near a town, on a march, our wagons are not with us, and there is no way of carrying anything but on your horse, and when on duty that is impossible, so I have not been able to get many things that I would have desired to purchase for you and Harriet. You asked my advice about sending Elmore to Mr. Stover. I think you had better send him; it will be much better than to have him lose so much time. I also think it will be well for you to employ Allie and keep the girls going, have them pursue a regular system of studies though, not merely music and painting, but common things, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, etc., and it would be better for them to have 4 or 5 other scholars with them: it affords a stimulus that is wanting where there is only a family. They cannot too thoroughly learn the common branches; they are the basis of an education, and unless completely mastered all things besides will be comparatively worthless. See that Allie has all that she wants, of everything that can be had. If I find needed articles I will buy them, but I do not expect to find anything unless we go North again, and I do not see any chance for that at this time. It was a great thing, a glorious achievement, to free our state from the enemy and drive him beyond the Potomac. Defence is our true policy much as we might desire some other, and as long as we can hold our foe in check, and strike him hard blows when the opportunity offers, so long we are doing well and our cause is prospering, we gain by delay and the enemy loses. Our army is filling up from conscripts and men returning from hospitals, etc., and it is thought we number more now than we did before the recent battles. We must reorganize, though, for many of our regiments have lost all their officers, and some regiments are reduced to mere companies. The Yankee papers say that one regiment of ours opposed two of theirs and three batteries and they could not move it. The 1st Louisana Reg. had 10 color bearers shot, and had 144 bullet holes through the flag and flag staff.  I have written to Staunton for a pair of boots,-to have them made. I cannot find a pair high enough in the instep. I could have bought a pair very reasonably in Md. if they had been high enough at the pinching point; as it is I am almost barefooted. I hope you will have grain enough for us and vegetables. I want to eat any quantity of vegetables if I should be fortunate enough to get home during the winter. I see no signs of peace as yet, and still think as I did at first, that only a change of administration will bring a change of policy in the North.  I saw any number of N.Y. men at Harper's Ferry, men of the better class. They had volunteered because they did not wish to be drafted, and New York had furnished her part of the 600,000. The privates all wanted to go home and stay there and were willing to let us alone, but the officers thought we ought to submit to the old flag, and had no right to set up for ourselves, and all such nonsense.  I hope I may get to come home before long. I am not very well just now; have a touch of diarrhoea and headache, but hope I may get over it soon. I am keeping quiet now.  My best love to all. I have some nice paper, envelopes, etc., for Allie and the girls if I can ever get a chance to send them to them. Write often, and I will try and do better, if we do not have so much racing to do. \",\n",

       " 'p004_021': 'We were greatly disappointed by your failure to come over, after I wrote you that Moses was here. Indeed from the terms of your letter I felt certain you would come. Mary\\'s disappointment was almost as great as if she too had known you, as well as the rest of us. She is extremely anxious to see you & Liz. She has heard so much of you that she wants to know you. She is now looking over my shoulder, and says \"that\\'s all true, Give them my love & tell them I do want to see them very much.\" Now that her message is reduced to writing she has taken her seat, and gone to knitting \"nubia[?] work\" with all her might. So I can write on. Whilst on this subject, let me add John, that my home is once more as bright as it ever was. The wife I have, is in every sense worthy to succeed her we both knew & loved so well. My children are just as happy as it is possible for children to be. They almost idolize their new mother. There home is so much more bright and pleasant now than it has been for months past, that the little things // are almost intoxicated with delight at the change. It is very touching to me to witness the deep tenderness of feeling which has sprung up between them, Especially between Mary and Jennie. Unconsciously to herself, I often see Jennie follow her mother from one room to another, holding her by the hand with the most confiding affection. Almost every morning, Jennie & Russie, as soon as they are dressed repair to the yard, and each makes a bouquet or weaves a garland of green leaves and gay flowers, with which they voluntarily dress Mary\\'s head when she appears at the breakfast table. And Frank never tires in his little efforts to attract her attention & win an approving smile. All together they are as happy a trio of joyous children as you ever saw. Last evening I was seated alone on the porch, just before tea, when Jennie came and sat by me, & said to me \"Pa I am so glad you have married again. I never want to leave you & Ma.\" Said I, \"Jennie do you love her.\" Her reply was \"Yes Sir, I love her as much as I did my own mother, and more than I ever loved anybody else // than you.\" And I have no doubt the child speaks the true feelings of her heart. . . . there are many here, who never before professed more than a speaking acquaintance, that you would now suppose had always been my most intimate personal friends. My wife\\'s sisters have been staying with us until yesterday when they returned to Charlotte, to give their mother the opportunity of coming over about the 1st of August to visit us and go to the springs. During their stay here they had quite a levee almost every night. & they found it impossible to return all their visits from the town. Mrs. Gen. Carrington & her daughter Nannie also spent 3 or 4 days with us, and they too received similar attentions. All this is very pleasant to me. It is gratifying to see the efforts some persons I will hereafter tell you of, are making to appear as the best friends I ever had. And it is no less gratifying inasmuch as it affords me the opportunity of showing by a frigid politeness my utter contempt for all such hollow heartedness. My wife\\'s relations, who will visit her from time // to time happen to be people that many in our community who set themselves up as the top of the place, are ready to fall down and worship, and all this new born friendship for me, is only to open the way for them to meet such of Mary\\'s relatives as may now and then visit her. When I see you I can tell you things that will make you shake your sides, knowing the parties as well as you do, and being thus prepared as you are to understand them fully.  But I am running on and filling a whole letter with matter of a sort only to be seen by the eye of the most intimate friend, and which even to him may hardly be of sufficient interest to justify the use of so much space to the exclusion of other topics I will fill the remainder of this sheet by simply adding, that, we are all well. . . . Mary & I have spent one night at the Col\\'s. which is the only visit we have made to the Country. Tomorrow night I think we will go to Cyrus McCue\\'s, and shortly to David Bell\\'s.  I had written the foregoing at the time it bears date, and intended to finish & mail it next morning, but was so busy that I had not the time to do so, and on Sunday we went to Cyrus McCue\\'s & yesterday was Court day. . . . Old Ben Reid died yesterday morning and is buried today. I have not heard the contents of his will. You know that some months ago he sold off his land & part of his negroes to Ash. Harman with a view to get his affairs settled before he died. Quarles and his wife were here in May. There is a rumour on the streets, credited to Wm B. Keyser, that Reid managed his will in such // a way as to give the bulk of his estate to Quarles, leaving little Reid with only $4000. and Sady much less than her proportion. I dont know what foundation there is for this rumour as I have not seen Keyser, nor have I talked with any one who has seen him. He is out of town today. The rumour further says that there will be a contest over the will, as Reid was not Compos mentis when it was made. This is all mere rumour. In a few days I presume we shall know all about it. Moses H. goes home on Thursday of this week. I wish you could have seen him. He is the same old Mose he always was, unchanged & unchangeable. He spoke often of you, and most affectionately. I have seen little of your father for a long time. He is evidently cool towards me, for what I know not, and he and Marshall barely speak. Wm P. Tate has bought your former home from Johnston. I do not know the price but suppose it is $7000. He moves there on the 1st October. Lord old fellow, I want to see you mightily, and haven\\'t the time to go to N. You must come over.

       " 'p005_021': \"Yours of yestderday is just received. I am glad, you are proceeding with deliberation. Great unquiet & apprehension, pervades the Public here. A vague fear distresses us, lest our people should be maddened by occurrences at the South and dragged after the seceding States. I am clear for keeping the State out of that vortex. I should be glad if we could make a migration to the Spottswood Hotel next winter. It is better located; and particularly fresh and nice; and by taking rooms in an upper Story, could lower the board to $12. But I know, it is difficult to make a party of such friends as we should like to have; and hence, we may have to retain our old lodgings. You, however, will have to be in Richmond on the 1st Wed. in Dec. as one of our Electors;--(for now I presume there is no doubt of our success) and I must beg you to look out and secure us lodgings wherever you think it best for us to be. I have heretofore looked forward to the meeting of our Electoral College, for a grand rejoicing. But, now, our political sky is so darkened that we may not have the spirit for it. Still, I would suggest, that the occasion be improved by a public dinner to the Electors, (which might be attended by our best men form every part of the State,) for the purpose of giving expression to our views; and sending on informally delegates to confer with the members of Congress form the South, particularly from Tenn. N.C. Ky. Missouri, Md. &c. Would not some of our Douglas allies attend by invitation such a dinner? Let me know what you think of this suggestion. Our public affairs are so critical, it seems to me, we should use every means of consultation with our friends in other States; and the meeting of Congress affords us a capital opportunity for that purpose. I confess, I am quite concerned by the difference of opinion among us, as to whether our friends should go into Lincoln's cabinet if invited. Of course, they could not unless well assured of the correctness of his views & feelings towards the South; and the agreement of the whole cabinet therein; but with such assurance, I do not see how they could, in justice to the distracted state of the country, decline to give such evidence of conciliation & pacification; though I well foresee, they would subject themselves to the severest obloquy from the Disunion Press. Still, I deem it a sacrifice, that should be made by them to the peace of the Country. Otherwise, the Public mind must be fearfully inflamed by the absence of any representative of the South in the Cabinet. Nevertheless, acceptance of such posts, must cripple our efforts to overthrow the party in 1864, and somewhat demoralize our opposition to Republicanism. This may be a practical question to you; hence, I throw out my impressions for your consideration with the assurance that I am perfectly willing to yield them to your better judgment.\",\n",
       " 'p022_014': 'My last to you was from Woodstock since which I have been at New Market and also Harrisonburg. The latter is quite a flourishing place and an important one in several respects and a school should be established there soon as practicable. Rebellion was deeply seated there and instead of getting better like total depravity seems to wax worse and worse. They do not boldly threaten the lives of those who may undertake to teach a school for colored children but, the more mild and nominally Union who are presumed to speak advisedly say that \"a teacher\" could not live a week\" and in answer to my inquiry \"do you mean to affirm that a teacher would be assassinated?\" answer \"certainly as he undertakes it\" Now I do not believe any thing of the kind. The very fact that they back this would lead me to doubt it. But they feel all over. I had a meeting of the colored people who are enthusiastic about the school and will with the aid the Bureau and Supt. of that vicinity provide a school room. It would be well if a man and  could be sent there immediately. Military protection will be provided when needed. I hope your Lutheran friends will be disposed to occupy that and adjoining fields unless you have other suitable help ready. There are Lutheran Churches scattered all along this Valley, and should Harrisonburg be occupied by such a representative, schools could be located in smaller places in the same vicinity (although of course at some distance) under his direction which I understood from Mr Whipple was desired. There is more work to be done and a demand for many more workers in this (the 6th) District than I supposed, and probably 40 to 50 teachers will be required if the field is properly cultivated. I have seen no place where Educational influences are more needed and demanded than is this Valley. We owe it to the Rebels that we throw in the Northern \"Yankee\" Christian Element here. They are miserable Rebels and I wish most heartily that Mr Beecher was obliged to spend a few weeks here and inform himself from this stand point instead of President Johnsons Blue or Green Room, as to the real spirit of Rebels, their constant cruel and outrageous treatment of the blacks their determination to make their condition as uncomfortable as possible their deadly opposition to their being educated, the hatred and malice with which they are constantly being [unclear: pursued] by all, professing Christians and ministers, seeming to vie with each other to outdo in their wickedness.  Mr Beecher and others at the North are now doing, the Bureau and all friends of the Freed people \"much harm\" (God forgive them) They are doing much to encourage these Rebels in their course. They are also doing much which tends to discourage the real Unionists at the South. Poor Fellows they have also suffered much and still dare not speak out their Union sympathies. You know little how such a  as Mr Beecher is working mischief to the cause of true loyalty in both white and black. My heart is too full for utterance and I can only with all Loyal persons express my surprise at such an unexplainable forgetfulness of and ignoring of the rights the condition of loyal men and women where present and prospective condition appeals to us all as never before for sympathy aid and protection. God will bring us into judgment for such a course. I find the school here doing as well as could be expected under the embarrassing circumstances which attend it. Mr Tukey has done all that any one could have done and the same is true of the Ladies Mrs Dunn and Miss McClean. They may be obliged to give up their present school rooms, if so I trust as good or possibly better accommodations may be secured. The school is needed (if only to educate Rebels) and is a \"fixture\" It needs however a reinforcement of teachers. (3) Three teachers should be sent here soon as practicable (one man if you can afford it if not three Ladies) One of the Ladies now here will of necessity be required to superintend house keeping but will aid in the schools so far as practicable. You are aware I suppose that one of the Ladies may at no far distant date sustain a much more intimate relation to Mr Tukey all of which will seem to be but perfecting arrangements for making this a pleasant and successful enterprise in the \"Valley of Humiliation\" this very \"sink-hole of Iniquity made so by these \"infernal Rebels\" while God and Native have done everything to make it a Paradise--almost. Bro Hunt, dont think me ungenerous or uncharitable. My feelings are those of all northern men in or out of the Army who see how and toward what we are drifting as a Nation. My hearts wish is that I had the ability of a Webster of Choate for in that case I would not remain South but go to the North and cry out against the influence of those who are unconsciously I trust, endorsing a policy which is so apparently unjust. Pardon me if you feel that I am writing too much on the subject. You would not blame me if you understood the tithe of the evil already resulted to the Cause you and I have at heart. I feel that if those of us on the ground--the battle field--do not cry out--the \"very stones\" will. I ought to know from you at once how much you desire to do in the Valley (I suppose I am to interest myself in the work, but not alone for the A. M. A. still I can with propriety at least consult with you as to your wishes. The Baptist Association I predict will not do much this way as the colored people are mostly Methodist, Presbyterian  Why should no  and your  supply the demand mainly in the Valley? I shall report in person to Col Brown in a few days and  and be prepared to aid where and in such a manner as instructed. To fulfill arrangements made between the Col and Bro Alvord I suppose \"I must needs go\" to Washington again soon. Much should be done every where for the Bank and I would suggest whether you and the Bank could not arrange some plan for combining representatives, + sharing expense, as a permanent arrangement. Mr Tukey has spoken to me about leaving some definite understanding in reference to teachers board etc. which seems proper. He is willing to adopt any feasible plan, suggests that with five teachers your assuming house rent cost of fuel etc. the house can be so managed that board will not exceed (20) twenty dollars per month and probably will be less. My advice would be that you let Mr Tukey manage it for you, giving him such authority as shall be necessary to his acting efficiently or if you choose to instruct me in the matter I will arrange with him for you. He is disposed to liberality toward you and desires to facilitate. It is quite important however that you authorize action immediately or the house now occupied may not be held which seems very desirable. In sending teachers please oblige Mr Tukey and also the ladies here by sending if you can do so Miss Josephine E. Strong (2 [unclear: Rowe] Place Boston) who was formerly at Portsmouth and afterwards at Hampton. They desire this if you are willing to favor it. Teachers for this vicinity should come by Steamer to Richmond then by R. R.. The Ladies now here came via Washington owing to peculiar circumstances, but Mr Tukey wishes me to say that they will pay all extra expenses incurred over the cheaper route. I find there are no books here or other facilities for the school rooms which is very embarrassing and I enclose a Memo. for books etc. for them which should be sent without delay by the best route, probably by Steamer to Richmond, then by V. C. R. R. This letter is long enough and yet I have not said half I should like to.',\n",

I have been very anxious to reply sooner but could not possibly do so my dear friend I can not find words to express the delight with which your letter was received and read, just at the time of its reception the two grand Armies in Virginia began to move. That day we had been under arms & in the saddles alday. all was excitement looking forward to the result of the coming great battle. of course it was a time for excitement, curious thought & sadness. late on the evening above mentioned, when I felt that our thoughts prayers & vigilent acts should be directed to the great task before us to be performed, I, for my part felt quite dejected & very anxious as to the issue of the next few days, Just then your pleasing & ever welcome letter came The well recognized hand writing upon the back sent a thrill of joy to my very soul & when I had given its interesting pages a carefull perusal you must know that my countenance wore an expression of delight for just then a friend past by & remarked \"Bob that must be a letter from your lady love. See boys said he how his brow is lit up. I answered no, but told him that it was from one whom I love as such & true it is there is no one who has a larger space in my heart than the one to whom I am now writing. I am glad to hear that you spent such a pleasant time attending church believing as I do that you have the proper appreciation for such duties. Now let me tell you of my profound admiration of your frankness & honesty of heart in telling me of your engagement I truly hope you have selected one worthy of your hand & I must say for him that he has been fortunate in winning the heart & hand of so noble a being as your self who in my humble opinion is worthy the love of a prince. Not withstanding he has but little of Earthly treasure I am satisfied he is a worthy young man as you think so. Earthly treasures should not be our object in matrimonial selections, it might be well said for me for I know if ever I am loved it will be for my self alone for I have neither Earthly treasure now mental or spiritual gifts. All that I can offer at the shrine of bounty is my worthless self. As regard your picture rest assured I want it & shall anxiously await your next letter hoping you may conclude to trust me with it & I promise if you wish mine you may have it as soon as I can have it taken, I suppose the sight of it may be gratifying to your curiousity but certainly not pleasing to the eye but I would only give it as one taken of momento of of friendship for were you free to now be wood I am not endowed with any of the qualities that are likely to be admired. Well my friend I reckon you expect some news but I think it useless to under take to give you all the particulars as I suppose you\\'ve the substance through papers as for our brigade we for the first time in any campaign since the war began have had comparitively an easy time it is time we have had hard marching & very hard duty but little fighting upto to day we have been constantly with our horses saddled & on duty (22 days) & have only lost about 25 or 30 men from the Brigade 8 or 10 from my Regiment, none from my Company one man was struck but uninjured. I am thankful to God that we been as blessed but the work is not hard and we are now confronting the enimy on the North Anna river in Hanover county looking for a fight at any time our troops are in fine spirits & always ready for action. I hope that freedom will soon be ours though I may not live to see it. I trust the Lord may hasten the happy times, I have told my brother of our correspondence. he will according to your wish destroy any letter coming to me & inform you of the fact should any thing happen.

By reason of the fact that I have been here but a short time, and consequently not sufficiently acquainted with Freedmens affairs here to enable me to make satisfactory report this must necessarily be brief and confined to those facts only which have come under my personal observation. The Freedmen as a general thing seem to be employed and industrious and so far as my observations extend they seem anxious to secure honorable, permanent employment and no doubt would make much more rapid advancement in substantial prosperity than they do make if the same liberality characterized their employers treatment that is observable in the relations existing between the white employers and the white laborers. It is a remarkable fact that the white man expects to receive the labor of the colored man for about two-thirds of what he is willing to pay the white laborers for the same service. The Colored people continue to rely upon the Bureau Officer for the settlement and adjudication of business between themselves as well as between the white and colored and seem to shrink from having their differences settled by the Courts. This I think is attributable to the fact that the white man generally is not interested in the advancement of the freedmen and is not inclined to protect his interests or to do anything looking in the directions of a recognition of their rights &c. Intemperance does not prevail to any serious extent amongst this class, in fact I am surprised to find such limited indulgence in strong drink when I remember that whisky at least in this portion of the country is at any time within the reach of the poorest. The colored people seem here to have an intelligent idea of their duties and relations to each other and daily show evidences of their appreciation of their new obligations and capacity to become a thrifty self-supporting and industrious population. They seem to be [unclear: insensible] to the influences brought to bear upon them by which to poison their minds against Government and Government officers. The School interests I am informed are in a flourishing condition and I am contemplating a tour through my Division for the purpose of developing this interest generally.

Our men seem very thoughtless & indifferent on the subject & I expect I am a little worse than any of them. For I have fully made up my mind to die here if necessary & I really feel eager to get into action. I would much rather be at your fathers table enjoying the delicacies which your own hand has prepared; but since it must be so, I am perfectly satisfied. We have just listened to a sermon from Capt Pendleton which differed in one immaterial respect from the one you have doubtless heard, in that we had no [unclear: fase] faces to look upon. This I believe is the first Sabbath we have spent in rest, & we may yet be ordered out before night. The weather is dry and favorable for our mode of living only it is rather warm. We frequently pass soldiers on the march who have fallen in the road from heat and fatigue. It is certainly delightful to the weary soldiers after a hard march to lie down in the woods or clover field as it may be, and gaze at the moon & stars. Lest Toney should think I am monopolizing space, (& I have no doubt I am if I know anything about dryed apples) I will close. I can never forget, & shall ever appreciate your kindness to me; & if it should be my misfortune never to return I hope you at least will not allow my memory to perish with my body. [unclear: How] arrived in camp last evening, he was complaining a little but [unclear: he's] better this morning. He say he dont know whether he will remain or not Some of my love to all friends and the rest which you will find much the greater portion unless the bag leaks, and you will reserve for yourself Your sincere friend S. A. T.xxxxxxx  Exit Dr. Enter Toney: John is now enjoying a sick repast, served up in soldier style, consisting of dry bread & ____ beef which doubtless he enjoys as much if not more than the delicacies he spoke of in the introduction of this epistle. It is not worth my while to attempt to give you a diescription of our camp. John has already given you a full discription, & in much better style than I could even if I were to try. This day appears more like sunday than any that I have passed over since I left home. Mr John Lightner arrived here on yesterday with [unclear: How] & several other boys from town. I have written some three letters to you since I left the Ferry & as yet have not received one from you. As for the note that accompanied yours & Miss Jennie I would say as I have done that I hope you will drop the question in discussion. & believe me to be as ever your devoted friend. I thought from the winding up of it that you meant differently, but I am [unclear: strongly] glad [unclear: to]  that such was not the case.

I miss my quiet little school-room where the children had less to attract their attention from their books; but they are much stiller than I could expect. I have almost entirely broken up the habit of whispering but it is more difficult to keep them from studying in that annoying buzzing under tone. However they are improving in this respect in the day school + [unclear: as] my night school it has ceased entirely. I had partly expected to find the children dishonest + untruthful  other + more experienced leaders encouraged strengthened the feeling but Either I have been more fortunate in my scholars or my plan of trusting them without tempting them is a success for I have not found a single instance of theft and but three or four of falsehood. From the first I have tried to teach them how wrong both were; while at every case of falsehood I have made an example. They prize highly my confidence in them one of my most trying scholars said to me one day, \"Miss Dewey I have never told you a story + I never mean to for then you couldn\\'t trust me any more  believe me.\" Some days ago I took to school a number of painted cards, as rewards for the children, all I had I suppose I left them on a little shelf close to the children\\'s seats After a day or two I went to get some from the box in which they were kept + to my surprise, found yet more than half as many as I thought I had brought up. I felt so confident that I said to the scholars \"I\\'m afraid some of my little girls have been taking some of my tickets. It makes me feel very sorry to think so for I felt I could trust them. I made some inquiries, but wafer denials were all I received. When I came home, to make certain I looked where I had been in the habit of keeping them + there to my surprise found all that I had lost I felt greatly mortified + sorry + I determined to apologize the Monday next, but before then one after another would drop in + would ask me, in Sunday school \"Did you find your cards?\" And \"Oh, I am so glad;\" when I said \"Yes;\" \"I couldn\\'t bear to have you think me a thief\"--\"I lay awake thinking about it last night; it troubled me so;\" were remarks by different children. All seemed so relieved I felt as if I could never suspect them again. Calling on the mother of some of my children the other day, little Annie said to me, \"I never tell a story now without thinking of you.\" \"Why Annie\" said I \"do you ever tell stories?\" \"Sometimes, but I try not to.\" \"Yes\" said her mother, \"she has improved greatly, for now if she tells a story she often says \\'I\\'ll take that back, it isn\\'t true.\\'\"--So our work here has its fruit, even now, + we believe that the harvest of which the first fruits are now given, will be a very bounteous one.

I have been Stationed in Kansas for the last 2 years and owing to the Army's participation in the Kansas difficulties have had a fine opportunity to become well acquainted with its resources, and local advantages; that opportunity I have not failed to improve. And I am now entirely convinced from personal knowledge, that with a little capital, and attention I could in a short time make a handsome fortune, by investments in real estate. You can form no idea to what prices that species of property will command at the opening of navigation. The rise is already evincing itself, and the tenacity with which the holders hold on to their property is the best evidence of its worth. But I did not mean to argue the propriety of what I am going to propose, which is to borrow from or through you ($2000.) Two thousand Dollars with interest at 6 per cent per annum for the period of two years or, if preferred, for a longer period. I feel perfectly sure of realizing a handsome profit in six months even a draft on Corcoran & Riggs Washington or any current Northern Bank will suit. I sincerely trust that you will accede to my proposition by sending me this amount at your earliest convenience for here time is emphatically money.

       " 'p007_004': \"As we are not marching today I have another chance of writing, I shall write again. I have not heard from home yet except by Andrews letter which was dated the 9th. I know you have written several times but I have no chance of getting them. Yesterday was an exciting time with us as the enemy was at our old camp (Camp [unclear: Clover]) & we expected a fight but they did not come, they retreated it is said to Maryland. We were marched to Martinsburg early yesterday morning & taken in a corn field over a hill from the road & was kept waiting for 7 or 8 hours dismounted with our guns in hand ready to mount at the [unclear: word] & two companies sent out to meet the northern men & get them to advance on us but they had not the spunk. There is now 8 cavalry company in this regiment all well mounted on the very best of horses & about 16 or 18 thousand infantry within a few miles at a little town called Bunker Hill. Since I wrote to you at Winchester we have been marching all the time. I will try & give you the routes. About 1/2 hour after I finished my last letter to you we left that place to cover the retreat of some troops from Sheperdstown. Then to Charlestown to cover the retreat of the troops from Harpers Ferry. We got to Charlestown early in the morning & stayed there for several hours, while we were there the road near filled with soldiers from the ferry as full as you ever seen a road filled with stock cattle. I do not know how many thousand this I can say the road near full for about 12 or 15 miles one regiment after another as close as they could march for the baggage wagons. After they got past we left & marched about 30 miles taking a back road to a point back of Martinsburg about 2 miles where we had to sleep on the ground with out our tents so as not to be easily seen. Now we are about 3 miles from Mburg on the Winchester road. There was three companies left here this morning to go down to see after the enemy & join Whites that was out in that part as a scout. I expect there will be a skirmish today if they can find the boys. News come to camp several times today that they had been plundering houses stealing negroes & stock of all kinds. Several family have moved by here today & a great many persons passing in vehicles of all kinds fleeing from the fiends. I heard that the R-ham Regiment had gone to Romney but do not know it to be certain. I told Capt Yancey today if there was any more men detached from his company for express riders I wished to be one as my chance for getting letters would be better as I would go as often to Winchester as any other point. We are treated with all the kindness that any one could wish by citizens. Everyone has water and provisions ready for soldiers which is either sent to camp or handed out as we pass. I have no idea which way we will go from here no more than you do & cant tell until we get out on the road which way we will go so secret are the moves kept. I have been quite well since I left home & did not find it so hard to sleep on the ground as some did. I suppose the rest of the family think I ought to write to them but I can't get the time to do so & they must not complain for I will not write to anyone unless I can write to you oftener than I have done. I don't want you to imagine so many things about me as you have done especially that I will be hurt in a fight for I do not have any fears of being hurt if we do get in a fight. I have not thought that anyone would be hurt after hearing from those fights where two men at Romney [unclear: could] keep back several hundred. It is a bad show for hard fighting with abolitionists is said & believe to be true that 2 men in a bridge there with several negroes to hold for them made several hundred retreat. We had our horses valued today & at big figures as well as I can guess the average must have been at $175. My horse was valued at $175 and saddle & bridle at 18. It is said by everyone that we have the best lot of horses in the regiment. Col Stuart said about 40 of our men are the best mounted men he ever seen as good the [unclear: star] company is [unclear: here] the one other said who had such fine horses. There was some 20 of our horses went to & over $190. The highest was 225, only one as low as a hundred. I wish you could see us getting meals. You used to think that we was dirty but if you was to see the beef strewn about on the ground & men cooking off it you would think we did not care for dirt. Our fare is nought nothing but beef or bacon & wheat bread. The bread is baked. Coffee we have to toast & grind ourselves. We have had sugar all the time until a few days ago the supply gave out. Tell grandmother I will write to her soon & will try to give her all the news in camp. Tell Maggie & May for me the dear little things Pappa will come back some day & bring them candy & will tell them so many pretty story about little girls giving Pappa bread & butter & pies. Tell Father I want him to get me some goods for pants as my pants is getting somewhat worn and will not last me very long. Line the legs below with something strong as they soon cut through with the stirrups [unclear: tethers] & send me ten dollars by someone for I may want more money if I should get a chance to go home. I can't go on horseback as they will not let a horse go out of camp unless on duty. Though I will not come back without [unclear: Percey] unless he is killed or shot or I lose him some other way. You must not try to send any provisions to me for I can't get it. There is a number of boxes there now for our company in Winchester. When you go home to your Ma's I want you to take Ginnie with you & ride her as much as you wish to do & take good care of the colt. Tell me if Henry Applegate will stay in our house until I get back & when you expect to leave & how everything looks.  All the ladies or most of them are leaving. I seen Miss Sue Pitman last Friday. She said she would leave for Shenandoah the next day also said she was going to write to Mary H. in a few days. She come to the gate & cheered the soldiers as they passed & gave some of them water while two or three servants did the same & Mrs. Arch Pitman. I want you to give every soldier you see something to eat as I should hate to have it said that you refused a soldier food when I have been fed by everyone almost. I will stop. Tell Sister I will write to her soon. I want to hear from Howard & Sam when you write again. I will perhaps get some of your letters tomorrow as Dr. [unclear: M] will send his servant to Winchester for the mail for our company. If I should fail to get one I will be badly disappointed worse than I ever have been before. I will now close this. Give my love to all of the folks at Fathers. Tell Father if I don't write to him not to think I don't want to do so as our chance for writing is bad and mailing worse. I want you to kiss the children once a day for me until I get home.

I told him I was not glad to see him as you could not come. The day seemed long & lonely to me without you my love. I scarcely knew what to do with myself all day it was so lonely.

I agree with you in advising Magnus to let Ella remain here until the last of September, but Ella says she cannot stay. I do wish she could I love to have her with us. Magnus did not tell me how he had disappointed you last Sabbath. I think he reproached himself when he saw how much I was disappointed by you not coming. he told me that you would come if you could get a horse, but said he felt sure you could not hire one as so many had been hired before you. I hope with all my heart that nothing will prevent you from coming this Saturday. I am so anxious to see you to be with one I love more then all on Earth. I do indeed think you are be coming quite fond of gay society. I was pleased to hear you enjoyed the Masquerade it was something novel to you & you could not fail to be interested. I should have loved to be with you but not there. You are in all my thoughts where ever you may be, I love you only & at all times with fervent & unchanging devotion of my heart & Soul. in my heart there is no change toward you it is filled with love & devotion only for you while I live.

       " 'p015_007': 'I have a little leisure in the cool of this evening & I will write you a few lines -- a little conversation, tho\\' far away over the Blue Mountains -- We have had an \"appointed day of fasting & prayer\", and it has been well observed -- a Sabbath stillness has prevailed & every one seems to have been impressed with a proper sense of the importance of humbling ourselves before God, confessing our sins & imploring his aid in the time of our extremity. Mr Lacy preached at our Hd. Qrs. at 11 A. M. to some 1500 -- among them Gens. Lee, Johnson, Rodes &c, & quite a group of ladies & children, on the nice lawn in front of the house where we are encamped -- his text was from 2 nd  Kings 6th-16 and he gave us a capital discourse in the estimation of all that heard it. He said though we had suffered a few reverses they were only needed to check our pride -- and in the only way it could be checked -- David had 3 alternatives offered to him for the punishment of his pride & he chose to fall into the hands of God - -we had vainly thought we could do anything by our might and had arrogated the glory to ourselves, but God had restrained us & it might prove our salvation -- He called upon each one to make himself what he ought to be before God, and then all would become good and a blessing could not be denied us. He argued that we had been favored of God, that we had sought to acknowledge him by our acts, while our enemy had ignored him & vainly boasted of starving us and such inhuman things which God could not, from his nature, approve, & so he must be against them -- . He administered a proper rebuke to frivolity \"the mingling of blood & festivity\", and gave to each one his portion. There is quite a religious feeling in some of the Brigades & many have been converted - five ministers of our church reported to Mr. Lacy this week, two from Louisiana, one from Alabama &c - Mr. See is down here for a time - Dr. Ben Smith\\'s son is here for a day or so with Lt. Smith - he is a fine young man --. I thought while Mr. Lacy was preaching, of the admirable notions you often have in your letters of the demands of the times & the merging of self in the public claims of the notion - I must commend you for your enlarged views of rights & duties.  I am very busy on the reconnaisance I wrote to you about, but hope to soon finish, when I intend to ask to come home for a joyous week with you & my sweet babes - and if all things are quietGen. Lee will grant it to me -- Wont it be delightful to come for a whole week just to visit & feel free to visit -- I will not dwell on it, only hope it may be so -- I do not often allude to my coming, only come whenever I can, so I do not raise any expectations which I cannot fulfill -- I had rather surprise you by coming unexpected than disappoint you by not coming when I had said I would come, so do not look for me my Deary, but pray that all may be favorable to my coming I was pleased to see Allen doing so well when I was home & hope he will continue to do well & I will reward him -- I hope to be able to soon get him a pair of shoes will as soon as I can -- I hope my little daughters are well -- and it comforts my long absence & deprivations of their sweet & pleasant words & looks to know that they are kind & gentle & pleasant to one another and to their Mother and that they are growing up like \"Olive plants around my table\" -- that they thank God for all his mercies, that they learn the lessons of His Holy Book and are trying to be like the Holy Child that went about doing & saying good --.

I find that he expressly states, in so many words, that the building would be used as a house of worship for his church and as a school house \"for all children without distinction of sect.\" On these terms the grant of $150 was made. It appears therefore that the Methodist Church has the right to the use of the house for Religious worship and that the Public has the right to it for school purposes.

       " 'p042_042': 'I will not wait for a reply to my Keysville letter, but write to you because I am thinking about you all the time. I wrote a long letter to Sister Lou last night in reply to a sweet, but half scolding letter I found here from her of date the 11th inst. It was in answer to my note from Richmond sending her my picture before I went to Mecklenburg. I again urged her to command you to say March. And if she does, you are bound to obey your older sister. If you do not I shall conclude you are not \"a good child\" as she said you were, and will not be a good obedient little wife, and you know that would be very distressing to an old fellow like me, who has been used to command - men - for I know well enough women don\\'t require it. I reached Richmond Monday morning at 11 oclock, & left for the city at 3.30 P.M. The girls Jennie & Russie are with me. How I wish you were of the party. They are enjoying the sight seeing hugely. Tonight we were at Hallack\\'s Theatre to see the Serious Family, one of the very best comedies I ever saw. The girls were so much entertained that they are not yet in bed at 1 oclock. I too am wakeful for I was sick last night & slept a good part of today, recovering from a bilious sick headache, the result of a cold I took in the lovely woods of Mecklenburg. When a woman promises to marry a man she gets very complete control of him. I feel that I belong absolutely to you, and you could make me do the most absurd things if you were a mind to do so. I shall not be fit for any very serious business till this state of things is reversed and you belong to me. I think the most sensible thing I could do would be not to see you again till I am to bring you away. For I find after leaving you it takes me several weeks to think of anything else. But on the other hand as I could hardly exercise enough self control to stay away four months, I suppose I shall have to take the consequences, and arrange my affairs so as to spend some time in our company business in your wilderness region, having headquarters at Lombardy Grove. I can\\'t yet tell when I am likely to get away from this City - not in all probability for several weeks, as I shall await here the return of Col. McKaye our President from London. You don\\'t know how anxiously I look for a letter from you. Now that your heart is mine I want to read loving words from you. I want to hear all about how you feel. What people say about us, for all such matters are a nice day\\'s sunder & the source of infinite gossip in the neighborhood. Tell me how your old loves stand the dreadful news that you are lost to them? How many more threats are made against my life? Or will you keep the matter secret and enjoy the few remaining weeks of your freedom to flirt with the unhappy youths your ilk? I don\\'t care how many men fall in love with you, provided you don\\'t return the compliment - and I am not much afraid of that, as I have such unbounded confidence in your fidelity & truth. Tell me that you wrote to Sister Lou - and above all tell me everything she says in reply. Mr. Strong has promised her to spend next summer with her in V a  & the North. I wrote her to come on herself, if he could not leave so soon, early in March, and join our bridal party. I should so much like to have her along with you to prevent the natural feeling of loneliness you will have for a little while if no one of your family joins us when I bring you away. An elder sister, and above all a married sister is a dear sweet companion to a young bride in the first pangs she feels in severing forever her ties of childhood & youth & going away amongst strangers. I never see a young bride without feelings of the deepest sympathy for her; for it is a great trial to part from all she loved so much and trust her life & happiness to the keeping of untried hands. How loving & how tender should be the husband when he remembers the sacrifice made for him? You may come to me with all trust and confidence for I rightly estimate my obligations and my duties to you & no act of mine shall ever bring one tear to your eyes.',\n",
       " 'p020_007': ' I had made every arrangement, gotten the furlough, etc., to go to see you and bring my wife and children, when the weather took such an unfavorable turn I had to decline going and trust to getting another furlough when the weather becomes more propitious. I am very sorry for we had all counted on a Merry Christmas with you and a happy reunion, since it has been so long since we have met. The children were terribly \"put out\" as they had been thinking of the visit for a long time and making plans for enjoying the festive season with their cousin, but I hope when the season advances that it may become milder and dry up some, then I can let you know when to meet us and we will have the visit yet, by the blessing of God. It is very bad going here now, it has snowed, sleeted, rained, frozen and thawed by turns until the foundations are almost broken up and the mud has put an embargo on all movements; I was never as muddy in my life as a few days ago in coming from camp home; had to take three trials at my boots before I got them clean. The Maslin boys are here tonight on their way from home to their command, Rosser\\'s old Brigade, which is encamped near Swope\\'s Depot. They have both grown very much and are quite hearty and make fine looking young men. James acts as a courier at Brigade headquarters. I came home the day after the Yankees came up the Valley, and week ago today, and have been home and about ever since, looking after my affairs, etc. Our quarters at present are at Fishersville. I have rooms at a house near Mr. Hamilton\\'s and am quite comfortably fixed; If you can come over, do, and see me there if you do not come further. We are getting along very well considering the times.   January 3rd. 1865. I had gotten this far when wife said it was bed time;- so I adjourned and have not found time to finish until now - late in the evening. I went to Staunton yesterday to hire a servant, but found that I could do nothing as they were all hiring for grain or produce of some kind and I find it hard enough to get what I want to eat. Servants hired very high; good men for 50 bushels of wheat and 50 of corn, enough to buy a servant in the market. The supply of servants was not at all equal to the demand. To secure William again, who has been so faithful to me, I bought him of his master who came up to sell him and his other servants - came in from Wisconsin, a genuine abolitionist, but like all the rest of them it must not cost him anything. I paid $5,000. Managed to raise $2,000 and borrowed $3,000 which I hope to find some way to pay before it falls due. Today I went to Staunton again and got a woman of Mrs. Opie - a first rate one, much better success than I expected. Today we finished a bridge over the river at Dudley\\'s. I had our Engineer Troops come over and build it, put it across above the mill. Tomorrow I have four wagons to haul wood for me and hope to get up enough to last me through the summer, and next day I must go to camp again, my furlough having expired. Frank Sterrett is down below Petersburg with the 10th Virginia Cavalry, as also Bob Cochran, William Nelson, etc. They say they have a hard time of it. Henry Sieg is at home - jogging along as usual and enjoying very good health. We are having a very hard Winter - it has been snowing most of today and the ground is frozen quite hard. It is quite hard on stock, the supply of forage is so scant. I got as much fodder as will do me, I think, and a very good supply of corn - thanks to the liberality of my neighbors.   John Bell and Mat Bell were married last week. Dr. Hamilton is as attentive as ever to Mrs. Gooch. James Arthur Wilson goes with me hereafter. I had him transferred to my department. The people here are getting up a gib dinner for our army in camp in the country it is to come off next week.  Give our love to all the children and Harriett.

The trials have chiefly been preliminary hearings before Magistrates and almost without exception where white persons have been parties the decisions have been in their favor - there have been several cases assualts upon freedmen - in not one instance has any satisfaction been given the freedmen it is only by the most strenuous exertions that I can get Magistrates to hear the cases and the results of trials are so unfavorable as to make it better in most instances not to try the case, for instance if the freedman makes complaint and it is clearly proven the Magistrate will probably bind both parties to keep the Peace, then the freedmen must get bail or go to jail for making the complaint. I give the following synopsis of two trials to show the impartiality of the trials the cases are not exceptions, but fair specimens of the rule. Chas K. Saupe (white) vs. Wm Gearing (F) -- Evidence went to prove that Gearing and his wife live in house adjoining and belong to Saupe. Gearings wife had been abused by the wife of Saupe, Gearing, a quiet mulatto, went in a respectful manner to Mrs. Saupe and asked what the difficulty was - She was angry at being questioned by him, \"a nigger\" - her husband came in and without remark struck Gearing heavily with a chain, three blows - disfiguring his face. Saupe then got the boy Gearing arrested, and swore the peace, the Magistrate binding Gearing to keep the peace, it not having been proven that he committed, or threatened to commit any over act. 2 d  Alexander Props vs. Taylor Dunlap and Robert Dunlap - Trial proved that the parties with the addition of Props brother Charles were working in hay when Chas remarked to one of the white men in a laughing way that he would let the white man take a certain part of the work - at which the white man struck Charles - Robert then remarked come work, don\\'t fight, when the remaining white man struck Robert with Pitch fork after some blows Robert resisted, and came out best in the fight, whereupon the whites together gave him a thrashing, after tea they told their father when the old man unable to find his slave whip, had a number of rods cut, and together the party whipped the boy for having resisted. The case after hearing before County Magistrate, in town was dismissed. It was difficult to get a warrant issued in the case - the white men admitted the statement of the boy, Robert, and also admitted his general good character, still altho\\' they had threatened him with further punishement no action was taken.',\n",

We arrived at Winchester last Saturday and we found some yankees there and we took a general review on Saturday and Sunday our skirmishes and the yankees was fighting all day long. The Yankees shelled us all day on Sunday. About half past eleven oclock our division, that is Gen. Early's division, took back about two miles on the left hand side of the turnpike and then we turned to our right and marched down below Winchester opposite of the Yankees fortifications, and then we laid there until six oclock and then we opened fourteen pieces of artillery on them in their fortifications. And I tell you the yankees had to get out of that place. Pretty soon the La. brigade charged on them and run them out of their fortifications and then our brigade charged for about a mile to hold the ditches. We took fourteen pieces of artillery from them at that place and that night the yankees got up and scadaddled out of that place and took for Martinsburg. But old General Edward Johnson he went down and got before them and as they come along he pitched in to them and took nearly all of them prisoner. I think that we have taken nearly all that was at Winchester. It is reported that we have got old Gen. Milroy. If we have got him it is a fine thing for he has treated some of our people very bad. I think we have got about four thousand of them. Our loss is not very heavy. We only lost one man out of our Regiment.

And having been located at this place during the past year as missionary to the freedmen under the above Association, I am acquanited with their condition and feel it my duty to aid them if I can. The membership in this church numbers about 150, and the only place which they occupy as a church is a small log house, containing two rooms each nearly twelve feet square. A large part of the congregation are of course obliged to remain at home or attend other churches I meet with the Sabbath School nearly every Sabbath and there are always nearly as many about the door outside as in the building--to say nothing of those who know they can't get in if they come, and so don't come. Even this hut they rent, of a man whose love for religion and negroes, is not sufficiently strong to make it certain that they can keep it for any great length of time Their colored Methodist brethren have joined with them in purchasing a lot for a cemetery. The cost of burying in the grounds of the whites was so much, that the friends of the deceased often found it next to impossible to raise the money to bury their dead The ground cost $12 00, and is to be paid for within a year. With these obligations and wants and struggling for daily bread, these people are making a vigorous effort to build a church. They have bought a good lot, for which they owe now about $400--having already without aid paid about one third the price for it. They wisely plan not to put up the building until the ground is paid for, and for this they desire aid They have also paid $400 unaided on the timber and there is about $150 now due. During the past winter the timber has been drawn to the lot and piled, and is now waiting the carpenter The building is to be about 40X70, and to contain a basement for a school-room. Nothing could be needed more Last winter as Superintendent of schools I had to use my utmost endeavor to prevent the Methodists from turning the children of the Baptist denomination out of doors, not from any animosity but for want of room; and in order to accomplish this, three teachers, and 160 pupils were obliged to perform their school duties, in the same room, and that only about 35 ft square It was too fatiguing to be repeated another year, and the erection of this building seems therefore as essential to the education of the children as to the religious instruction and worship of the people. Relying upon God, their own energies, and the aid of the beneficent, they hope before winter comes again to accomplish their object. There is some indication that they will receive some aid from a Western church, but they will still need some 300 for the present purpose. One half or even one third would, however greatly aid them, and without that aid, it is clear they can not carry on their work I do not know that I ever knew a more urgent case of this kind.\",\n",

We are not living on the same farm we were, when I last wrote to you but on a great deal prettier place, I feel more like I was at home here than anywhere I have been since I have been in the state The dwelling is of brick, two rooms above & two below; brother Frank is living in one end of the house, he & pa are going to farm together; we will have plinty of fruit of different kind if nothing happens it, the trees are all in bloom, We are having a very backward spring, the farmers have never began to plough yet. Southern persons are very low spirited here they think we will have worse times since the death of Lincoln. I am loth to believe the southern men, after having so much of the best blood of the South spilt will surrender to the very ones that caused so much trouble, I am glad to find that there are some that are true to the cause. I would like to have peace but not the way we are to have it, I would be willing to suffer the hardships of war four years longer if at the close, we could have freedom with our peace. I am glad to know your Sister Mary is going to school, for it is the only thing a person can retain, education I mean. It always was very important to have an education, but it appears to be more essential now than ever. The family join me in love to you and the other boys that are in prison; also to friends who are now living in the Old Dominion state. I remain as ever ',\n",
       " 'p019_000': \"It has been a long, long time since I heard from you, and I lately learned that you had not heard from me, though I have written often. I hope this may reach you tho'. We have had all sorts of fortune lately. Have been badly handled in two fights, but not half as badly as the Yankees as our own papers assert. At Winchester we had whipped the Yankee infantry when their cavalry charged ours on the left and broke them and got in the rear of our infantry and compelled them to fall back, and they took a good many prisoners, but we retired in good order and saved all our trains; the same thing happened at Fisher's Hill, only the enemy got thirteen pieces of artillery. They only took some 500 prisoners from us. Since then we have successfully resisted them, holding them back at New Market and driving off their cavalry from New Hope and Waynesboro. The Yankees are now near Harrisonburg, but I hope they will not be there long. They did but little damage in Augusta county; burned a few barns and mills in the lower end of the county, but in Rockingham they have done a vast amount of damage, burning mills, barns, wheat and hay stacks, and robbing houses. The cavalry, some of it, was from Broome county. I got hold of a copy of the Broome Co. Republican; see that David and Albert Hotchkiss had joined the cavalry. Giles had gotten the quota diminished by 100 for the county. Rev. Mr. Gilbert is in Binghamton, and I see that his daughter has lately been married to Mr. Bruce. I will send you the paper, though torn, as soon as I have sent it home. I only heard of them. Will look out for the prisoners now and get the news. The Yankees did not go to Churchville this time at all, those that retreated from Waynesboro went by Spring Hill and Mossy Creek, but in so much haste that they did no damage. They burned Mohler's barn at the cave, and J.C. Roler's at Mt. Sidney. The loss of grain to us is very great, but I hope there is still enough left. The corn crop is a tolerable one, and they only use enough of that to feed their horses. The only damage done the R.R. was to burn the bridges over South river at Waynesboro and over Christian's creek. They robbed Mr. Garber's store in Staunton of $5,000 worth of goods. There is a tale in circulation that Gen. Early was drunk at Winchester and also at Fisher's Hill. There is not one word of truth in it. A baser slander was never circulated. It is true Gen. Early is a drinker of spirits, is too fond of it, but I have never seen him under the influence of liquor since we started on this campaign. He is sober enough to know his duty and attend to it at all times, and it is much to be regretted that such stories should be circulated. My usual luck attends me in regard to horses. A few days ago I had 4, now I have only 2, one killed and one died, I got one for the killed one and now one has been stolen. I had a fine colt that I wished to send you to keep, but it was killed in the fight at Weyer's Cave.  Miss Allie cannot stand it at home, and she desires to come back to Virginia. The fogs make her sick, and the people torment her, call her traitor, etc., and she is very anxious to get back. She had not heard from any of our people as she had spent most of the time at home and had not been well. I succeeded in getting a supply of flour with much difficulty. So many had sold all to the government before I got a chance to look out and a good many had sold on speculation, but I got a barrel here and one there, and so made up what I wanted. Henry [unclear: Sliey] stays at the old place and manages it for the heirs, the old lady being dead. Sam. Cochran died a few days ago, from fever, at home. Robert is a detailed farmer, also H. Seig and Frank Sterrett. Young Hite died from the effects of a wound. We have been resting today, after a hard march yesterday through the rain, and we have enjoyed the sunshine. I went and heard Mr. Bowman preach. Mr. Hildebrand has been getting along badly at Churchville. They do not support him. He says no one of the Methodists has done anything for him since he came there. Mr. Greeding has joined the Presbyterian Church and been made an Elder. They are all well at home. Got a good deal frightened about the Yankees. What are you doing and all the family? I should be delighted to see you all, but see no chance now. I have only been three days at home since March. My love to all. Write me soon to Hd. Qrs. Valley District, care of Gen. Early. \",\n",
       " 'p018_000': 'Well, dear, the chances for getting home soon \"grow smaller by degrees and beautifully less\". About sundown yesterday the infantry passed by our train down the Valley. At midnight our train recd. orders to join the Brigd. line and to all appearances we are bound on another mission. I hear that 15,000 reinforcements are marching down the Valley to join us. If this is so, then we are off to Pa. or Md. again. Yesterday our Cavalry chased the enemy into Martinsburg and a portion of them entered the town but were soon forced to leave it, but we will reenter it today. I think and perhaps may have another battle. Till then, Adieu. Ah yes.\\' I suppose you have seen that Hood succeeds Joe Johnston in Georgia and Trimble of Charleston. See in messenger that Grant is said tp be killed. Genl. Mulligen is at Winchester and is bound to die. I think has five wounds. 8 A.M. 25, 64. The whole army is advancing on Martinsburg where the enemy was drawn up in line of Battle last night in heavy form with 4000 cavalry under Averill. Mars Jubal, Breckinridge, Gordon & McCausland, with other general officers are in ten yards of me. They expect a heavy fight today. Cavalry fighting yesterday pretty heavy and has commenced again this morning. Haynesville near Falling Waters Potomac River. 7 P.M. 25th July, \\'64. Great was the chagrin and disappointment of this army on finding that the enemy had continued their flight across the Potomac last night. We pursued them as far as Williamsport, Md. and found except a few pickets the main force has continued its flight through Md probably into Pa. The indication of a fearful panic continued to the very banks of the Potomac. We are ten miles in advance of the infantry which is encamped at Martinsburg. What Genl. Early will do next, of course, I don\\'t know but I think there will be a movement here soon which will make the heart of my little wife glad. I was sitting on my horse at a cross road today while the troops were going into camp talking to Col. Cochran of the 14th and two or three other officers who were standing in the road when two young ladies, elegantly dressed and splendidly mounted, came riding by. One of them looked and smiled so sweetly, as she bowed and waved her hand as she passed us, that I turned in the saddle to look a second time. She gracefully turned her beautiful head and from the tips of her fairy fingers wafted me a kiss. Jerusalem, of course I returned it, as gracefully as the suddenness of the action would allow! Asked Col. C. to knock me off my horse if he pleased which he refused to do. Fact is I threw a somersault from my horse, sprung into it again, and vowing I could not stand such banter set off after her. Rode a mile, had a very pleasant time and after promising to call on the Misses Turner, bade them an affectionate farewell. Oh, yes, they were intimate friends of the young lady I spoke of in a former letter as having given me a pair of gauntletts. I tell you there are great temptations here for a newly married man from home, but I think of Harry and all is nothing.',\n",

It is hard to have ones cherished desires crushed in a moment & when we thought our joys almost complete to have them suddenly turned to sorrow but such is life -- such is the expereince of everyone & it is sound philosophy & true religion to meet the changes of life with resignation & compassion when we are assured that we have fully done our duty -- so I bid you all cheer up & hope for the \"smiling face\" behind the frowning providence.

       " 'p011_044': \"After long waiting I at last heard from you a few days ago -- got your letter of the 6th inst. -- I have written to you since the victory at Harper's Ferry since then has been fought the bloodiest & hardest fought battle of the war, near Sharpsburg on the Antietam Creek in Maryland in which nearly our entire army was engaged with McClellan's. The enemy began the attack and we repelled them and drove them back with great slaughter, especially on our left wing, which was commanded by Gen. Jackson, and on the right where A.P. Hill commanded, our center was not as well sustained & gave back some & there our loss was greatest -- We had many thousand killed & wounded but most of our loss was in wounded, slight wounds, though we lost many valuable men -- Gen. Starke, Gen. Branch & others were killed - - We held the battle ground -- The fight raged from 4 in the morning until 9 at night -- we took 3 or 400 prisoners & many small arms We occupied the battle field the next day and refused to let the enemy come to bury the dead &c, though they asked the privilege three times, which showed plainly who had the advantage -- both parties were too much exhausted to renew the fight -- we spent Thursday in collecting our wounded, burying our dead &c & that night we quietly left Maryland, avoiding the plan of McClellan for fighting us & compelling him to make up a new programme. It was a night of suspense for our immense train and large body of troops had to pass the river by one ford with McClellan's vast army close behind & watching our movements -- but it was all accomplished, safely, Providence blessing us with a fog to aid us -- the enemy did not know anything about it until all were safely over except the cavalry picket, and it made good its escape. The movement was equal to a great victory & left us free for new plans -- As soon as the enemy found that we had left the pursued and planted artillery on the river bank & made quite a scattering of stragglers &c that happened to be near -- & of wagons &c, but no damage was done I believe, but we had batteries of the shore too and compelled them to Cave in turn -- We moved back most of our force towards other points & left a few to guard the ford, with some artillery & that night (Friday), the enemy came over in great force and surprised our men & took a few prisoners, captured 4 guns & killed a few, holding both banks of the river, but yesterday Gen. Jackson went down & pitched into them and slaughtered, captured & scattered all that were on this side. It is reported that 1700 dead bodies of them floated down the stream and we took 60 -- The Yankees have the greatest fear of Gen. Jackson, and if they know that he is after them they think they had better give up at once.  We came up yesterday to Martinsburg and then out to Opequon Creek, where we are taking Sunday, the first one in some time. Part of our troops are still in Maryland, at Williamsport, and we may go there again any day -- in fact I think we will go there tomorrow if the army gets together -- though I do not know. I hope to soon get leave to come home and fix up for winter, get some clean new clothes &c -- and fix for your supplies -- I cannot conjecture when my turn may come but Providence has always favored me and I trust in Him for good with an unswerving faith -- I am glad that Nelly is getting along so well with her studies -- try and have her think & know what she is doing, and do not, by any means, exercise her memory at the expense of her reasoning faculties -- avoid making a mere memorizer -- of her -- and do not let her have too much on hand at once -- lest she become weary of study -- especially cultivate in the children unanswering obedience -- I think no excellence can equal, in children, the crowing one of respectful and cheerful obedience.

       " 'p023_018': \"I received a letter from you several weeks since. I would have replied sooner but for the fact, that having sent your letter out to David soon after I received it, I was under the impression until yesterday that he had answered it. I was delighted to hear from you once more; and truly thankful to hear that you were all living and in your usual health. My little family are all in their usual health also. Em. and my two little girls returned from Wheeling, about ten days since, whither they had been on a visit since the last week in October. I took them out, and on my return home I met with a merchant from Chattanooga, who was on his way home from New York, whither he had been to purchase goods. I thought it a good opportunity to communicate with you, as it was then very difficult to send a letter directly through to Summerville. (Indeed I do not know that it is much less difficult yet.) I accordingly wrote you on board the cars and gave the letter to him to mail in Chattanooga which he promised to do. That was written on the 2 nd  of November but I have never heard whether you ever received it. Feb. 3rd You will observe more than a week has elapsed since I wrote the foregoing. The reason of the delay in finishing my letter is this. I did not have time to finish it on the day I commenced it, and I concluded the next day that I would wait until there might be a decided change, one way or the other, in David's condition, who was then quite ill. He has been very much better now for three or four days past, and, I think, with care will be well in a short time. He has had an attack of inflammatory rheumatism, but not near so severe an attack as he has had. But his nervous system seemed to become very much deranged, and he was in a state of delirium, most of the time, for three or four days. He has been sick about one month: suffered a good [unclear: eal] with rheumatism in his arms, hands and legs, the first two weeks; but has been in a measure clear of pains for the last ten days. He has no negro men employed now: he has, however, two white men and boy about seventeen years old. Ann & Mary are still there, but I learn indirectly that they contemplate leaving in the spring. Ben still remains with me and also my woman, and are both doing well. Henry left David soon after the surrender, and is now living with William Guthrie. The negroes are very trifling, as a general thing; and none of them are willing to contract by the year, and a majority of them do not seem to be willing to contract at all for any length of time. Business of all kinds is very flat now, and there seems to be no money in the country. It is almost impossible now to collect a few Dollars from the best men in our community. And what is more the tax collector is here now gathering in the Land Tax. I very much fear many of our farmers will forfeit their land from their inability to pay the Tax. The Tax here is 27 cents on the 100 Dollars on the assessment of 1860. And if the Tax is not paid in a [unclear: certain] time the government will sell the land and appropriate all the money arising from the sale. Aint the Yankees the most fiendish nation on the face of the earth? We have just got in money sufficient ($42.50) to pay the Tax on Father's Estate. Write me and let me know whether you will be able to pay the Taxes on your land. If not, and the thing is possible, we must [unclear: assist] you in order to save your land.

Carse being Rockbridge, Alleghany and Bath Counties. Sub district Lieut Cook Augusta and Highland Counties. I visited the Hdqrs of each Officer and found them competent and efficient in the discharge of their various Bureau duties. Having practical knowledge of proper manner of keeping military records their official books and papers are in commendable condition. Both officers report the general condition of the freedmen in their sub-districts as good. Occasional outrages occur while many employers refuse payment for services rendered, yet in the main the freedmen are doing well though as a rule getting very low wages. Justice will be given in the superior Courts excepting in occasional jury trials yet in all cases as a rule before magistrates no justice will be given. Assaults on freedmen result in the offender being bound over merely to keep the peace in trifling sums by the magistrates and have not in any instance yet been carried before the grand juries for action of the higher courts while complaints for recovery of wages or compensation of labor are not entertained. Yet while the freedmen commit crimes and go before superior courts he stands a creditable show. Col. Carsy's Register of Marriages is partially taken while care has been used to carry out remaining paragraphs of circular No. 11. The County authorities have assured him that they will care for all destitute but have no means for so doing. Apprehends much suffering this winter. Supply of labor about equal to demand.

The introduction of schools will meet with much opposition and can only be [unclear: enacted] and supported through Government aid. He doubts whether a house can be obtained for this winters use in Lexington. Lieut. Cook's Register of Marriages has been taken in Augusta County though differing from printed blanks since sent him and necessitating therefore a new registry which as soon as complete he will take that of Highland. He has endeavored to enforce other paragraphs of Circular No. 11. It is the intention of civil authorities to care for destitute having levied a poll tax for that purpose but which will not be in operation before spring. He apprehends also much suffering through the winter if government supplies are cut off as anticipated by order. Supply of labor equal to demand. Schools are in successful operation in Staunton and will be during the winter. None elsewhere in his sub-district though desired by the freedmen. They could be established if places could be obtained in which to put them. The opposition of the whites to the education of freedmen by yankees renders establishment of schools outside large towns almost impossible.\",\n",

Numerous complaints are still made at this office of unfair treatment in settlements or refusal to pay wages earned but I find as a general rule parties are willing to settle when I bring the account to their notice and in many cases the difficulty arises from ignorance on the part of Freedmen of the terms of the contracts they have signed or forgetfulness of the amount and value of supplies they have received. A great obstacle in the way of advancement among Freedpeople is the frequent changes they make of employers, thereby losing much valuable time from profitable labor and incurring heavy expense in shifting their families and goods. There is not much pauperism, at this time, in this Division, still there is much poverty not perhaps as much as might, under all the circumstances, be expected nor more than can be readily relieved by local public and private charity. Strangers, widows and deserted wives with young families, and the aged who have been brought from other counties are the majority of persons needing help. The social relations between white and colored present no change. The senseless fears of \"social equality\" make the prejudiced whites unable to see any steps made in advance by Freedmen, in any other light than an encroachment upon their own rights and safety, and the idea of political independence seems to them little less than a heinous crime. The demeanor of the Freedmen is however peaceable and without so decided and general in their expression of loyal sentiment, that I anticipate no difficulty during coming canvass and election. The moral condition of the Freedpeople is not what it should be. There is much loudness, and cohabitation without marriage in common and will continue to be so until the statutes against this demoralizing practise are en- forced by the courts. The Record of Marriages, (under Act Feb 27/66) is carefully preserved in this office, in good order for reference, and is frequently consulted. [unclear: For] additions have been made to the List of names during past month, but I have directed several parties to the County Clerk for licence to marry. I regret I cannot report the organization of any branch of \"Lincoln National Temperance Association\" in this Division, but I am pressing the matter with some of the leading colored men here and I do not despair of success. I am sorry to report that too much of the harvest wages earned by Freemen has found its way into bar rooms and with two Circus exhibitions during the month there has been more drunkeness than any previous month I have been here. I am pleased to find there is a prospect of a small supply of Medicines from Dr. [unclear: De Lamath] Surgeon in chief B.R.F.&A.L. for the benefit of Indigent Freedpeople. When received care shall be exercised that none save the class for whom it is intended draw upon it. The desire for reunion of families (colored) separated in years past by the vile traffic of the slave trader, is general and often, through medium of this office, successful. One great obstacle in the way of prosecuting such enquiries is the destruction or [unclear: secretion] of the books of the large Slave Marts at Richmond.',\n",
       " 'p026_041': \"Having heard with surprise that complaints have been made against Mr F S. Tukey Ast Supt of Freedmen's Bureau of this place therefore this is to certify that I am a Union man and was a refugee from here during the war and went to Washington D.C. and was in the service of the U.S. Government Q. M. Dept during nearly the whole of the war. I came back here soon after the surrender and opened a Livery Stable which I kept for awhile and then changed my location and bought out a colored man who had been in the same business here for many years and then hired him to remain with me his extensive acquaintance among the colored people naturally brought many of them around the Stable and gave me a free opportunity to mingle with them in conversation. I often heard many of them speak in the highest terms of Mr Tukey and so far as I recollect never heard one of them say anything against him and I know that his course here during his former period of service was entirely satisfactory to the Union men and Freedmen and also forced the Rebels to respect him. During a portion of the time  Lieut Cook was here he boarded a Government horse in my Stable, which Horse he traded off with another man after he was relieved he came to me in a state of excitement and said some hard things against Mr Tukey among others he said that Mr Tukey had undermined him and lied about him and had reported him to Hd Quarters and swore he would have satisfaction and said he meant to come back here again and from all that I have heard since I am satisfied that the comaplaints against Mr Tukey have been made in a spirit of malice and revenge.\",\n",

Asst Comr &c dated Richmond Jany 29th 1866 I have the honor to submit the following \"Report\" showing the condition of \"Freedmens affairs at this date in the above named Division. Nothing has occurred during the \"Month\" which is calculated to change the opinions hitherto expressed as to the capacity of the colored race in the matter of becoming a thrifty self-supporting population. Occaisionally I meet with one who seems disposed to remain poverty stricken by declining to take advantage of opportunities by which employment &c might be secured but with these exceptions the race as a race are evidently advancing in intelligence and industry - and I am convinced they would show more [unclear: earnestness] in embracing education & other advantages if any substantial encouragement was given them by the whites. I believe that the feeling of distrust cherished by them toward the white people which was engendered by the disposition betrayed (immediately after the war closed) to not allow them any of the rights & privileges of the citizen, has been strengthened by the indifferent and [unclear: careless] manner in which the interests of the freedpeople are handled in the Courts and by the whites generally. I am not prepared to produce any particular instances wherein the aforementioned facts can be established but my conclusions have been arrived at after close observation of the workings of public sentiment. The crops have so far as a general thing turned out better than was generally expected thus demonstrating the fact that the farming interests have not been injured by the change in the larbor system and if all of the employers would deal justly and honorably with the laborers many of the evils of which they complain would be lost sight of entirely but when they impose all kinds of charges &c upon the laborers reducing the balance due to almost nothing and frequently bringing the latter in debt they must expect that dissatisfaction would grow out of such injustice and it becomes very reasonable when it is [unclear: remembered] that by reason of the ignorance of the laborer in connection with his suspicion of the white man the nature and details of business transactions cannot be explained to him in many cases. Intemperance does not seem to be increasing to any marked extent among the colored people.

Oh Kate I never saw any one look so life like in my life not one change from the dear face we parted with last summer not one did I say, not one in outward appearance, but oh that one great change that had sealed those dear lips, dimed those eyes & stilled that tender loving heart. Kate I felt as though I must say something to him to wake him up for I could but think he was sleeping, no mortal hand could have smoothed that countenance to such perfect tranquility. John now sleeps to wake no more but his pure spirit unconfined is exploring the regions of the unknown world. After remembering & sending messages to all his schoolmates & friends he told his Pa to tell one & all to meet him in Heaven & his last moments were prayer haveing become perfectly concious. Kate Just two days before his death his Father in mooving his sachel let your likeness fall. John said \"Pa take that home with you & take good care of it.\" I donot know whether he said any more about it or not. I wanted to have a talk with Mr Lightner the day of the funeral but so many were around him asking about John that I had no chance. Doctor McFarland preached an exelent sermon from Psams the CXIX 119 chapter 75:76:&77th verses. The first hymn: It is the Lord, enthroned in Light; The second: Lord we share thy best designs; The last: submissive to thy will, My God. He is buried in Mr Pilson\\'s graveyard by the side of his uncle John Tompson & now farewell dear Jno until the resurrection morn where we hope to meet you in realms of light & blessedness: Farewell, Farewell. Kate I now feel so sad that I can scarcely reply to your funny little ditty which I just  recd  this evening. Much obliged to you my dear girl for warning me not to fall in love with that dazzling little Jno. H. & adding \"He is already sold\"; but Kate he told me upwards of a goodeal; but think not Kate that these eyes did not very readily perceived that he was far from being sincere. And from the honesty of my own heart feel feel that I have an honorable pride which will not endure to be trifled with. Nevertheless I am of the opinion that he & the certain Jno you spoke of as being the boy are one & the same, now why warn me not to set my cap (\"He is sold\") & you miss in a far more dangerous position than I! But perhaps you have found out the error of your way as the rich man who saw Lazarus in Abrahams bosom, & like him when you find by sad experience that there is no hope for you, come to testify unto me lest I too fall into the same error. This is the only construction I can put on it & I would say to you in return beware did I not think it eventually & irrecoveribly too late. And Kate Moses will not get a chance to see me or rather will not desire a chance until you get home, for he knows I cannot have the compassion on him that Pharao\\'s daughter had to take his ark from among the flags. So I fear that he would never get \"out of the Wilderness\" himself, let alone bringing the children of Israel out. Moreover I have no tobacco yet so he must not come until you get home, but when are you coming you dont say anything about that \"but I heard you must come the last of March.\" I dont expect you can leave until the Rangers go away. Well they will be gone by that time.

I think he is fixing to doge the Militia again, but I think he will have to suffer with them this time. Ask Frank for a description of him. I believe Hetty wrote about he & Lizzie making up! Kate Father sold Nelly today to a  [unclear: Mitchie]  soldier who has enlisted, for a Cavalry nag or he first traded with him & got 150 dollars to boot cash then before he got home sold the one he traded for for $75.00 getting $150. for Nelly. I think her well sold. Cous Abe talks of buying Lucy you had better come home & lay claims to a pony or you will have to walk this summer. Mary told me to get you to tell Cous Frank to take good care of her interests in the Sellars down there. And I have one question to ask Jno. H. (that sold lad) whether he is still an unbeliever? And one to ask you who has bought the precious gem? Mag S. says she will write to you soon Lizzie & Mary were up last week, sends her love to you. I have never got a chance to tell Sam yet. Lizzie said tell Jany that she expects the Malitia will be called & dont think she will get down, give my love to her & tell her to come up soon. Lizzie wants you to ask Aunt Lee if she aint getting tired of of one Kate Armentrout by name. I have cut Lizzie\\'s hair off you ought to see her. She was at the store today & got you a Hat. I dont know how you will get it though. Lizzie says you must try & get those little buttons she told you about, & send them with Pa. I did not know until this morning that he was coming, but Mother cant come along it is too cold & Father cant stay more than four or five days.

But I am tired of writing on a subject which I hear discussed so incessantly therefore I will change the current to a theme which interests me infinitely more than all else on earth your own dear (pardon me) self You bid me write all I feel, yet I can not summon courage to tell what I have never told before. I fear--every thing. Yet I have already told you in effect all I would say; my last letter must have conveyed all to your mind; Can you bid me hope? I know I have no right to infer any thing from what you have said previous to this; it is true you have expressed friendship for me but friendship is cold and formal, and I fear you can give nothing more. Oh! If I could only hold your hand and look into those eyes which have lit the darkest hours of our separation you could then no longer doubt with what feelings I regard you, you would then know how much I love. I confess I have dared to hope, from the free and confiding style of your letters that perhaps you could reciprocate my affections, but if I have misconstrued your manner and from false premises formed wrong conclusions please do not blame me, my wishes may have biased my judgement, but if so I deserve sympathy rather than censure. I shall in that event try to love you more as a sister, and be a friend to the one, who more fortunate than myself, shall gain your hand and priceless love. So far life has been to me a happy dream my wishes have been realised, I have succeeded in my undertakings and fortune has smiled upon me. In school and college I never thought of failing and thought the highest rank only worthy my exertions, but every one must learn to bear disappointments, and if I must endure this, although the sorest of my life, I will try to nerve myself for the sad task. Being alone in the world, having no sister in whom to confide and upon whom to lavish the tender affections of my nature, and no brother whose helping hand could smooth the path of life, I have always longed for some one to love, to trust with every secret of my heart one who would seem almost a part of my existence. Although not usually considered sentimental, I do not think love to be a fairy legend of the Poet\\'s brain, but a powerful, enduring passion which binds the heart to that of another, firmly and forever. Such is the love I would offer. Can you receive and requite it? You ask who it is I would [unclear: bide] you love and encourage me with the assurance that you \"could not be so cruel as to deny him all the deep devotion of your fond heart.\" But you have just said the one you love must be \"embelished with the charms of refinement nobleness and goodness.\" Oh! that the one of whom I spoke could pass that hard ordeal, then it is I, I would bid you love but I feel that the aspirant for that greatest of all earthly prizes if weighed in the ballance would be found wanting. I am certain you have long ago become weary of the subject about which I have been writing, and which my inexperienced pen has rendered so uninteresting. It is indeed a novel undertaking with me to describe the secret attractions and impulses of my heart, feelings never before experienced. But I know you will make sufficient apologies to your own mind for a letter which is from the heart and not the intellect. Please do not neglect to answer all these things in your next for you have no idea how eagerly and impatiently I shall awaite an answer. You need not fear of wearying me no matter how much you may write on that subject or indeed on any other. The greatest pleasure of my life is in the free and unrestrained communion with kindred spirits, and thoughts and feelings are always more welcome, whose sympathising emotions are fare dearer than all on earth besides. Oh! If I could only be free once more and go to the spot, to which my thoughts ever tend, I could be supremely happy, now I cannot help like Moore\\'s lover sighing for the placid \"Lake, And the light canoe of my dear\". To be your companion in those boat rides and mountain strolls, to be your escort when you ride and sit beside you when no one else is near and tell you all I feel, all the depth of my affection for you, that would be the ultimatum of happiness, my imagination can paint nothing which nearer realises my idea of the \"Sunum bonum\", the greatest good of all on earth. But I must close, I have already wearied you I fear and must not try your patience too far. Please write to me at once a long, confiding letter; tell me all, even the worst. I shall waite so impatiently for your next letter, but I know you will be punctual, you always are.',\n",
       " 'p022_022': \"It is Saturday night and I am very weary. Our school commenced night before last and we had two rooms full. The first 3 days of the week we spent in Hunting for rooms in which to teach, the people being bound to keep us out. Last night we had three rooms open and full. To day I have been at work fiting up the the fourth room ready for Monday. The four will hold at least 200 Mr Coan came last eve and will stay thro' the Sabbath We get frequent sneers, but good treatment to the face. But we are to have to a colored Prayer Meeting here this eve, and I must hurry. They have shut the colored People out of a church which they helped to build and own 1/2 of it. We shall have to open our school rooms for them, altho' I believe they allow them to occupy their own church If they will have a white leader. I love my work. The books have come that you sent. But I write you about my trunk. I am suffering for it Send it immediately, or write me God Bless you.\",\n",
       " 'p005_017': ' Your letter was received this evening and I take this opportunity of answering it. I am glad to hear that Franks opinions upon political principles are undergoing a change and hope that by the time he has a vote that like his brother he will be an orthodox democrat. As to the party to which I belong being disunionists it is a charge that cannot be substantiated and I defy anyone to prove by our platform of principles or by the record of either of our candidates that we are. There are men in the party (of which I am one) who seeing that without a vigorous effort we will be wrecked upon that shoal to which we have been slowly but surely been drifting for years -- I mean slavish submission to a mear numerical majority. We hold to the principle among others that this government is not solely the government of a majority but that the minority have rights that must be respected. To preserve these rights the constitution was framed which puts such checks and restraints upon the dominant power as the framers in their far seeing wisdom thought necessary. But it is said that at this late day we have suddenly waked up to the idea that we were not getting our rights in the Union and that the leaders of the party were disposed to ruin the country for the sake of reopening the slave trade. The last of these charges is a rediculous absurdity and could only been hatched in the brain of some unscroupulous opponent of the true States Rights Democracy.  Now as to the other question we have been battling against abolitionism is some form or other for many years. The abolition of slavery has been agitated in congress ever since 1790 first came petitions in that year for the abolition of the slave trade. Then petitions in 1805 for the exclusion of slave property from the teritories. Then in 1817 petitions against the slave trade between the middle and southern states. Then in 1831 petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. In 1836 Calhoun declared that the agitation of this question \"would sunder the Union.\" \"It was agitation here that they feared\" James Buchannan showed that the moment it was abolished in the District that this Union would be dissolved. In 37 the contest grew hot in the house of representitives and there for the first time John Bell proved himself a disunionist by helping to keep open an agitation which Statesmen like Calhoun had declared would break up the Union. From that time foarth he has acted with the abolition party sometimes openly at other times he failed to vote on either side -- at others he deemed it prudent to represent his constituents. Now on the other hand the party to which I am attached have always been consistently opposed to all such measures. We (speaking of the Democracy) have opposed the agitation of this subject in the halls of Congress. We have denied the right to petition upon the subject because slaves were propperty under the Constitution. (Though Botts in his late speach here took the ground that they were not) and could not be confiscated. We have procured a decission of the Supreme Court in our favour (Dred Scott case). Speaking of the power of Congress in the teritories Judge Chief Justice Taney uses these very words. \"The only power confered is the power coupled with the duty to protect of guarding and protecting the owner in his rights.\" Out of the nine judges of the court seven concured in this decission. And yet when we incorporate this in our creed and demand that Congress shall exercise this protecting power we are branded as traitors by the very party who were loudest in their professions of loyalty to the South a few short months ago. The party which declares that they go for the enforcement of the laws. Yet when we ask to have this power which the higest tribunal in the country has declared is legal enforced cries out that we want to break up the Union -- and that we are a set of traitors who ought all of us to be hung. We have been driven to the wall at last. As a last resort we stand upon the Virginia and Kentucky resilutions of 98 and 99. By them we have determined to stand or fall. Holding up the Constitution we have asked to have the rights it secures us given to us in the Union. If we have theme we are the last people who would wish to dissolve the Unionon. On the other hand we have determined that if it is necessary that we should go out of the Union for the purpose of maintaining these rights that we will do it. It is an alternitive which we do not seak but as a free people we will not submit to having our rights taken from us by that greatest of all tyrants a numerical majority. We will have no more men like Bell to compromise our rights away -- compromise but invites aggression. For one I am like Harry Hotspur \"upon a matter of right I will cavil to the ninth part of a hair.\" Upon the election of Lincoln which the opposition I fear are making but too sure -- some if not all of the Cotton states will leave the Union if they are allowed to leave peacibly the other slave states will not be slow in following where interest points. If the Federal power attempts to coerce them into the Union again the border states will not be slow to make common cause with their more southern sisters. So that in any event we will have a United South.  I am glad to hear that all are well I feard that either you or the baby was sick from not hearing from you sooner. There is no news here except in political circles and even there the argument seems to move very much in a circle. we start with the resilutions of 98 & 99 affirming the right of a state to leave the Union and we end with them. Baylors proposiston to fuse with the Douglass faction fell like a bomb among us and I confess I among others was afraid a fusion upon that basis would be acceeded to. Thank Heaven that danger is past and that our  electoral ticket remains untarnished with the name of a single man who holds to the hericies or follows the fortunes of that desperate political gambler Stephen Arnold Douglass.  tell Frank that I will send him some papers -- But that if he wants to understand the issues in the present canvass he will have to read the long editorials and  contributions not paragraphs about murders. I suppose you are about as tired as I am by this time so I will close. Hoping that all are well ',\n",

Then I went to work at copy setting (for I [unclear: set] some copies although I have printed ones in my writing books, yet it pays, if one can do the work) At 3-o-clock I helped Mrs Dunn teach Singing, and at night I taught my school. Thus I was in the school house from 7 in the morn til 9 at night. Last Saturday I went hunting and must have walked 15 or 20 miles, in the woods. This is the first leisure day that I have had. It did me good, and I was disappointed in finding that I was not lame after. These large fox squirrels are a beautiful animal. The lamps came last Monday. Capt. Howe had to go to Richmond to get them as they were carelessly left there. But I am sorry that you were not more careful in filling my order in regard to lamps. I ordered 12 small side lamps , and 24 chimneys and you sent me 8 large bracket lamps, which will not light my four rooms, and will burn more oil than 12 small ones and cost more money. Mr Coan has arrived from Lexington. He says that you objected to sending the lamps on the ground of some report that the School Hous was closed and school could not be continued Now I wrote you before I ordered the lamps the state of affairs That we had, had trouble in getting rooms as the schools had been turned out of the Court House, before we arrived But when I ordered the lamps, the school had been in operation for a week',\n",

I have been on road detail to day (making corduroy road to Guinney's[2]) and have to go again to morrow, so you see it will be impossible to go to Guinney Station before Monday, if indeed I can go then. I suppose you were led to believe, that large profits could be made on skillets from having heard us speak of having to pay 12 or 15 dollars for one. If you could get that price, it would pay very well, but I do not think you could get it; unless you could get them to the different brigades of the army and sell them there, in which case, I think they would bring 12 dols'. The sutlers [3] of regiments do not buy them at all, so far as I can hear, unless they get orders for them. As for the Sutlers at the Station, I can not speak positively, but think they act in the same way. The day you went up, McKee [4] failed to get one, but got the promise of one soon, if he would leave 10 dols, his name etc, which he would not do. However I am of the opinion that you might sell them there for 8 dollars apiece, in lots of 20, or 30, and it might be as many as 60. I think there would be no risk in you staying a few days, at the Station. But you know there is no accomodation there, and no place to keep them. I got the box that night. It was a treat, I tell you, but you will know that after the sight of it. The coffee is delicious. McKee got his furlough next day and started in about an hour. John D. got his too, and went Monday. I want you to send me a tin plate by him. If you buy skillets, you ought to do it at once while the army is lying quiet. A good many soldiers have been courtmartialed in the brigade.

       " 'p012_020': \"I have only a few moments to write this morning before starting on to Winchester, where our Head Quarters are, but I know you will expect something from me, so you shall have it. I have been over the ridge to Culpeper C.H. to see Gen. Lee, and had to come back by the way of New Market, a long circuit, but necessary for safety, as the enemy was along the base of the Ridge and rapidly advancing, though I hear that they have fallen back now. I was on the battlefield of Cedar Run, a portion of our army was encamped there. The evidences of the hotly contested field are plain to be seen. I enquired for Grinnan at Culpeper, and it was said he was in prison; for what or where I did not learn. I suppose he has been taken by a conscript officer, as he has not been on duty since he got well. Our army, that is Gen. Jackson's corps, is still in the lower end of the Valley, and I hope we may stay here, as the best check we can have on any advance of the enemy. We are skirmishing occasionally near the Blue Ridge, and we have taken a good many prisoners. 120 went up to Staunton a few days ago, and there are some 150 here today. It is said the enemy has been destroying everything before it, turning up the cornfodder in the fields, where they advanced in Loudon and Fauquier Co's. I do not know how true it is. I hope to come up soon. I must rest my horse. I wrote to you to keep my coat and boots until I sent or came. I hope you have got them, especially the boots. The crop of corn is fearfully short where I have been, and not much wheat sown, but I hope there will be enough. Buy some potatoes if you can. This is charming weather. I hope you have been able to seed a good deal. Put in all you can. My love to all the family. Write to me. \",\n",
       " 'p042_039': 'You don\\'t know how much I am grieved at your long silence. I reached here last week confident I should find a letter from you but none has come to hand. Before this reaches you I may, & hope I shall see you. Col. Flournoy left here yesterday and tomorrow I follow him to Danville. On Saturday I am compelled to return to N. York for a few days on business vital to the V.&G.W.R.R. which it would take too long to explain on paper. If it be possible for me to get away from Danville on Wednesday night, I will come down to Keysville and Thursday go to Lombardy Grove, spend the night and Friday get back in time for the down train, so as to go on to N.Y. Saturday. But so earnest is my desire to see you, and in person assure you of my unalterable affection, that I mean to do so if it is in the compass of human effort. Our R.R. affairs are in a crisis so vital to the success of the grand scheme that I have subordinated everything to that. If we can accomplish certain objects we have in view in the next two weeks it will be plain sailing for us afterwards. All this I can explain when we meet, & you will then understand what a struggle I have had between my obligations to the public and my personal happiness. One day with you would be a compensation for weeks & months of work and trouble. Should you ever be my wife our happiness is largely involved in the success of this great R.R. enterprise, for I have a fortune dependent on it. And the very love I bear you has been an additional stimulus to my efforts. Since I parted from you not one day has been at my command. It has been with me like Hood\\'s song of the shirt \"Work! Work!! Work!!!\" Such a life, unblessed by the love of such a woman as you would be intolerable - but with that reward I am willing to bear it, till such such success crowns the effort as will compensate all the labor. Believing we shall meet before this reaches you I will not anticipate on paper what I shall then have to say. I have written to \"Sister Lou\" tonight & sent her my photograph. I enclose you one, if fate should decree that I may not deliver it in person this week. I did so hope you would be at the Fair. It would have crowned my happiness completely. My darling, if you will let me call you so, be patient with me, for I can not help the delay that has kept me from you so long. Goodbye - God bless you.',\n",

The other half staying at the mill, not being allowed to go to sleep, as we were expecting to have an attack. some of our boys were pretty badly scared. at seven oclock we started back for our Old Quarters where we arrived at half past eight pretty hungry. we then partook of Bread & Beef with coffee to our satisfaction & now I am seated at at table in the Capt\\'s office writing to my dear Annie, whilst many of our Boys are fast a sleep in their rooms.

       " 'p010_029': 'I wrote you a brief note, yesterday, telling you of our victories and that I was well, and this evening I will write you more fully, after a day of enjoyment in which I wish you could have participated & enjoyed some of the good things they left behind in their hasty retreat -- delicacies of every kind, in getting up which the Yankee nation seems to have surpassed itself -- But to begin, I will not say at the beginning for that would embrace thirty days -- but after the battle of Kernstown, on the 23rd of March, and briefly relate the movements by which we got Winchester and drove the haughty & insolent foe back from our Valley -- From the 23rd of March to the 18th of April we slowly retired before the superior numbers of the enemy, resisting his advance at every favorable spot, and only moving back when he came on in force, and, finally, when we reached Harrisonburg, by leaving the main road and throwing ourselves into a defensible mountain pass near to the forces of Gen. Ewell, we prevented the advance of Banks upon Staunton & put ourselves in a position where our movements could be concealed, we were there until the 30th of April, showing resistance down the river, below us & also towards the enemy\\'s front at Harrisonburg, completely [unclear: puzzing] everyone in regard to our movements, on the 30th Gen. Ewell & his army moved up to Conrad\\'s store and we moved off to Port Republic, the force at Conrad\\'s Store being still about the same, so Banks thought it was all there still, then on the 3rd of May we crossed over the Blue Ridge, and Banks heard that we had gone to Richmond, but the force still there i.e. at Conrad\\'s [unclear: puzzed] him the more then we rapidly crossed back to Staunton and on to North Mountain & pushed back the forces of Milroy & fought the bloody battle of Bull Pasture Mountain & drove Milroy, demoralized, back to Franklin & by leaving the Valley made Banks think we had run away from him to carry on the war in Western Va, then he moved back to New Market for fear we wd. fall on his flank, but let Shields go away to Fredericksburg to join McDowell, supposing, no doubt, that Jackson was too far off to get back soon to his front, but was completely deluded by the appearance of Cavalry all along the Mt. coming to the conclusion that Jackson was at Brock\\'s Gap, Jackson having, by the move westward, divided Bank\\'s forces, at once moved rapidly to New Market and making a demonstration towards Wood-stock as if he intended to go that way, he suddenly sent the forces of Gen. Ewell, which had been concealed by the movements of Cavalry, towards Front Royal, preceded by a large body of Cavalry, which place they reached on Friday and by a sudden attack drove out the forces of the enemy there, captured a large amount of valuable stores, about 1000 prisoners, two locomotives and trains of cars, the stores worth from one to two hundred thousand dollars. The regiment that made the attack on our side was the First Maryland, and the one that it attacked was the 1st Yankee Maryland, neighbor against neighbor, ours took the flag of the other & then the Louisiana Tigers joined in the pursuit and followed them so closely that they could not burn the bridge behind them though they got it on fire, and when some attempted to escape on the train to Strasburg the found that Ashby had been sent across the country to our left and had after a hot engagement, in which Capts. Shotts, Fletcher & other gallant men of ours were killed, drove away the force of the enemy at Buckton Station, between Front Royal and Strasburg and torn up the track and cut the wire before the attack at Front Royal, so when the train ran up that way it found the track up and came back to find us hotly pressing behind, so there was no alternative but to flee towards Newtown, 14 miles distant, which began at about 6 P.M. and then the splendid cavalry Regiments, two, some 1000 men under the command of Gen. Steuart, charged after them like a whirlwind, capturing wagon after wagon, loaded with valuable baggage ammunition, them horses that had been cut loose and squad after squad & company after company of men, officers & all, until some wearied out by the hot pursuit, halted behind a fence and buildings, and, in the darkness, poured a deadly volley into our men, but, though some 10 or 12 were killed or badly wounded, there was no halt, but with uplifted sabres our men rushed upon the ambuscaders, over the fences, and scattered them to the four winds, causing many of them to bite the dust, and inflicting horrible wounds upon others, there a perfect stampede of them occurred in every direction, seeking to escape from the dreaded \"horse & his rider\", but in vain, and hundreds of them were captured that night and the next morning they were brought in from all sides by men women & even servants, (what few were left, for many preceded them in their flight and we captured many of them.) The spoils were large embracing 2 pieces of artillery and about 800 stand of arms -- all the field and staff officers were taken -- We desisted from the pursuit and rested after midnight, but at an early hour the next morning, the 24th, the forces were in motion, moving on the road as if going to Newtown, but about 11 o\\'clk the Gen. started me on the road towards Middletown and Strasburg to find where the enemy was, I soon started up a picket, that fired into us, (some 20 Cavalry and myself), which I reported to the Gen. and he sent up some infantry of the 8thLa. Regt to aid me, which we threw out as skirmishers and pushed on through the woods, and drove to the enemys picket, and found that they must have a force in that direction, the Gen. then sent up Col. Ashby with cavalry and flying artillery and we moved them up rapidly, reaching to near the McAdamized Road, when we discovered a body of Cavalry massed before a church in Middletown, and saw their trains moving up the road, previously we were informed by the Gen. that Gen. Ewell had gone to near Newtown with with a portion of the army, thus protecting our right flank -- as soon as the shell fell away the Yankee cavalry they began a stampede, and as there was a Regt of some 700 hundred they filled the road for some distance, the companies of the 8 La. moved promply forward and just gained the crest of a low ridge, along one side of which the road ran, as the cavalry passed, and poured into them a deadly volley, and such a tumbling of men and horses, as the General afterwards remarked, \"it looked too bad to see so many of them disposed of at once\", the artillery was at once brought up and thundered on the retreating line and Ashby and his cavalry dashed rapidly forward to a turn in the road and cut off those still going on, and captured the train of several regiments, any number of sutler\\'s wagons, loaded with every luxury, and hundreds of men and [unclear: richly]  horses -- the pride of the Yankee army, it\\'s superbly mounted Vermont, N.Y. & Pa. Cavalry, that had exultingly and insolently rode over our Valley, was melted like snow before the sun, and the road, for miles, strewn with the choicest of viands & most valuable of goods. I am not vindictive, but I really did not feel sorry to see the horse & his insolent rider laid low, it seemed a just retribution for the evils they had inflicted on an innocent people.  We had by this move cut off the rear guard, two regiments, of the enemy at Strasburg, and we turned towards them, when they set the bridge on fire, across Cedar Creek, set fire to their stores in Strasburg, and then commenced throwing shells at us, but we soon stopped them and they started in flight, but we could not cross to pursue them, so we could only drive the from their baggage a distance, and then start, at about 5 P.M. with our whole force, save one Regiment, towards Winchester, and lustily did the Regiments from that part of the state cheer when they were ordered towards their homes, then commenced one of the movements in which Gen. Jackson shows forth his iron will, he wished to reach Winchester, on the hills West of it, before the next morning, and he was now 12 miles off, after a march of 12 miles, and it soon became evident that the foe intended to dispute his progress, for they began, soon, a heavy fire of artillery at our advance, from every hill top, made a stand near Newtown and drew up in line of battle trying to turn our flank, but we drove them from that at about dark, capturing many more wagons, then they began to burn up their train, loads of every thing, rice, sugar, bacon &c, and 6 long boats intended for a pontoon bridge and, by the light of these, they fought us with desperation for miles ambuscaded and fired upon our men from behind walls and from thickets, but still Jackson\\'s iron will was bent on attaining a certain point and he rooted them from every strong hold, resting not through the long and wery night, driving them across the bloody field of Kernstown and, early on the morning of the 25th he drove them from the hills before Winchester, and aided by Ewell on his right, who had moved along in that position, he poured a deadly fire into them, and when Banks attempted to retake the hills he met such a storm of leaden hail from the \"Stonewall Brigade and our other gallant troops that, though he fought well, and we even ordered up reinforcements, at that moment the intrepid leader, in front, amid the roar of musketry and artillery, devoutly raised his hands to heaven, as if for Divine aid, when the enemy\\'s line wavered, fell back, and fled, \"now\" says the General, \"swinging his plain grey cap, Let\\'s shout, and at his shout up went that of the host with him and all dashed forward in pursuit, the day was won, and through the streets of Winchester we pursued the foe that had gloried in its pride and power but two short days before, amid the huzzas, shouts, tears, thanks, looks of unutterable delight, waving of Confederate flags & handkerchiefs of its whole liberated population and by the crackling of the flames where the vandal foe had set on fire the very center of the town where his stores were, piles of shells that would have blown the town to atoms, it was a proud entry, and through we went, the sons of Winchester in the lead deling death to the foe at every corner and when we reached the other side of the town, the General, now thoroughly aroused, turned and said \"Order the whole army to press on to the Potomac,\" and on it came, and on sped the foe and after them we hurled shot, shell and iron hail, for miles, until the General ordered our men to halt, and the cavalry to be brought up to pursue, he then turned to go back to meet the cavalry, passing along through our 3 united armies, who had had eagerly sought the ordered rest after 40 hours of exeration, but they felt not the labors they had endured for all even the dullest, now was the consummation of the long marches, the short rations, the sleepless nights, interdicted furloughs -- victory had come from them, and as the hero of it turned back there was one shout of triumph, one spring up, one waving of hats from one end of the long line to the other, all murmurs were hushed, and \"Old Jack\" was the greatest of warriors to them and the idol of the hour\\'s affections We pursued the enemy with Cavalry 22 miles beyond Winchester and have captured in all over 2000, over 200 wagons with horses & harness, a vast store of medicines & hospital supplies, more I suppose than we had in the whole Confederacy, a large amount of valuable ammunition &c &c and sent Banks and his proud army in confusion and dismay across the Potomac and where we go now will be for our own choosing We destroyed the B.& O. R.R. at Martinsburg and captured more stores there than here, large stocks of provisions &c.  I have not time to write more, let the friends & neighbors all read this if they desire. Love to all.

We are constantly moving about, as usual; yesterday we moved from Bunker's Hill towards Charlestown, intending to attack the enemy, Averill found we were moving & drove in our cavalry Vaughn's Brigade, which offered but little resistance to him & then ran away leaving some 14 wagons in his hands & compelling us to return from our movement to look after him -- we drove him away & recaptured some of the wagons -- We came back here for the night -- had a very long march -- Today we move again, back to Bunker's Hill & then after the Yankees again. It is said part of the Yankee troops have gone to City Point -- if so we shall give them a staggering blow -- We cannot rely upon our cavalry to hold points & that makes it very difficult for us to move rapidly as we have to guard our trains constantly We learn by the late papers that McClellan & Pendleton are the nominees of the Chicago Convention -- I have not seen the Platform -- but think it must be a peace one -- Pendleton is a southern man in principle & it is thought he will be for peace -- everything indicates a strong peace movement in the North & they may succeed in electing their candidates The nights are getting quite cold, but the days are very pleasant. I will write to Mr. Geeding about the horse -- should like to know what he will give -- he knows what horses sell for now -- Ask him? Sept. 5 th  -- I did not finish my letter before we were started off to join Gen. Anderson who had gon to Berryville & there met & defeated the advance of the Yankees towards Winchester -- whipping a corps with a division -- We went down to aid him & found the Yanks had entrenched themselves strongly so we did not attack them, but the defeat Anderson gave them caused their cavalry to come back from a raid they had started way up the Valley, so our object was accomplished -- Yesterday we came back to Stephensons where we now are, in time to join our Cavalry in a fight they were having with Averill & we drove him back several miles, until dark stopped the pursuit -- One of Alfred Wilson's sons was wounded in the fight, not severly though -- we had several of the Cavalry killed & wounded -- They behaved well It rained very hard last night & today it is very moist -- We are being smoked by camp fires & lounging round to pass the day -- I think the rain will do much good -- making the ground fit for plowing. I suppose McClellan will be elected as nearly all the Army of the Potomac goes for him -- Pendleton, the nominee for Vice Pres., is a man with strong Southern feelings & a peace man, it is said -- Evidently the Peace & War men have made a compromise matter of the nominations & will all be for peace if the signs of the times are as much in our favor as they are now. We are very well assured of the fall of Atlanta, since the Yanks have official despatches announcing it, but we are full of hope that even good may come from temporary ill & that Hood has not given up the place but for good & sufficient reasons -- I am in excellent health -- Hope to hear from you today again -- it seems a long time between your letters - Love to the children & blessings for you from our Merciful Heavenly Father -- Write often My Sweet one -- \",\n",

       " 'p007_042': 'Your, as usually, most welcome letter was received on yesterday morning and read with unusual pleasure. We had just returned the evening before from Manassas Junction, tired and low spirited, so your letter was quite usefull to cheer me up. On Thursday before last we left our camp near Leesburg and marched down within about six miles of the Junction; here we were kept in a continual state of alarm, we had to stand or march in the sun all day and then sleep on our arms all night without either tents or even blankets and were usually aroused several times during the night by alarms and compelled to stand in line of battle until our scouts could be thrown out and ascertain that no enemy were near. We had about half enough of stale bread & cold fat meat to eat not near half enough muddy water to drink. We had become so accustomed to false alarms that on Sunday when they drew us up in line of battle behind a hill, I had not the slightest idea that we would get a sight of the enemy. About nine O\\'clock we were formed as a reserve behind some small trees and underbrush which served to hide us without offering us the least protection. Shot, shell and minnie balls fell round us like hail but still we were kept in line of battle exposed to their fire without being able to return a shot until about one O\\'clock when Gen. Beauregard rode up. We gave him three good hearty cheers and then turning to Col. Hunton he said \"Colonel had your regiment without a moments delay to the thickest part of the battle.\" We came through the woods in dreadful disorder on account of the density of the undergrowth, but as we emerged we gave a shout, so loud and terrific that the two regiments of Yankees who had been placed there to oppose us broke and ran. We then marched to the relief of the extreme left wing. As we came up we met the South Carolinians and Alabamians in full retreat, they said that the day was lost and that all our men were in confusion and retreating, but still we marched steadily on notwithstanding the storm of grape, canister, shell and minnie balls which were flying round; when within about three or four hundred yards of the enemies right wing we halted and took the enemies fire without being able to return a shot until the South Carolinians and Alabamians formed behind us, then we charged with a shout. The enemy seeing men charging with such alacrity when they thought their victory complete and our ranks in remediless confusion, became frightened and ran away. We took the house which defended their right wing and then stormed and captured the battery which had been pouring shell and shot into our ranks, but the enemy fled so soon that the fire which we sent after them did little esxicution. After the battle was over we started about sunset and marched eight miles to Manassa Junction in quick time before we could get any thing to eat or drink. About ten minutes before we were ordered into the battle two of our men took all the canteens of the company and started after water, they were unable on their return to find our regiment, so we had to fight all day and then march eight miles without any thing either to eat or drink. Our company escaped almost miraculously without even a man hurt, but the left wing of our regiment, behind which an Alabama ensign was carrying his flag, his regiment having all retreated, was cut to pieces dreadfully. Seventeen of the men in one of our companies fell the first fire. Gen. Beauregard complimented our Regiment very much, thanked our Col. for the gallant conduct of his command and said that we had turned the tide of battle and gained the victory when the South Carolinians and Alabamians were retreating. I have not attempted to give an account of the battle but only to let you know as briefly as possible something of the part we took in it. I expect even this has wearied you nearly to death by this time and so I will drop that subject. I am so heartily tired of it I know as you can be, for I can\\'t get a crowd of fellows here now to talk of any thing else but the battle of Sunday. My feelings while in the battle were hardly unpleasant. I believe I would soon become fond of the excitement at least I rather hope I shall be in one bayonette charge before I leave the service. Besides wanting to stick my bayonette in a Yankee I wish to see if I can feel as cool when marching on the steel as I did while the balls were whistling round me. I never felt the whole day as if there was a possibility of a ball\\'s striking me. I had a kind of presentiment that I would not be killed. Please excuse my writing with a lead pencil and putting you to so much trouble to read it but pens and ink have gone out of fashion in camp and are \"[unclear: vavae ares],\" here.

Do you remember I told you I would not sleep until I thought you had arrived safely at home. nor did I either.

It does, for all my unhappy doubts thinking you did not love me as my heart longed to be loved by you in return for the deep & undying devotion it had given & lavished truly upon you do you know, that I often thought one reason why you seemed so thoughtful & troubled was that you had [unclear: seen] my affection & found after calm consideration that you were mistaken in your feelings & did not love me. I told you last Sunday night how often & how deeply you grieved & pained me whilst in Staunton by your cold & silent manner, because I thought you did not love me & I was loving you all the time with a true & unchanging love. I was loving & thinking of none but you, wishing & praying Oh! so earnestly that I might know your true feelings for me & why you were so cold & silent when you came in mypresence. I never was as unhappy, never suffered so much in all my past life as I did then when doubting your love. I am glad of the happy change in you for your own dear sake, for I know you are so much happier & to feel & see that you are bright & happy is to make me so also. If I could give you uninterrupted happiness in this world you would never know one moments trouble. I would keep all sorrow & anxiety far from your heart & mind your face which I love to look at should never be clouded with painful thought if the power were mine. Your pathway through life should be sunny, glorious, happy & beautiful, but no mortal being ever has yet in this life tasted of the cup I would if I had the power place to your darling mouth but any one can be very happy if they just would try in the right way for there is joy for all who will have it if they only try they will find it but I can't be happy when I think you don't love me.

       " 'p022_029': 'Yours of the 22 and 23 are received and my trunk has also arrived. I would also say that I have perused your letter with interest. And am not surprised that you have mistaken me for a careless person, both in regard to dress and manner. I feel therefore that it is not improper for me to make some explanation. And you will no dout be pleased to learn, that in regard, to the effect of Dress and all personal habits upon those with whom we associate, that I am not a novice whom you will be obliged to educate to this very important fact, but that I am fully capable of understanding this relation, and do most heartily endorse all that you say on the subject. In fact I have spoken in public upon this very subject and can now produce a written lecture which I once delivered in [crossed out: the town of Middlebury] Ct, containing much of this sentiment Furthermore it has been my practice in schools to require neatness and have even had soap and water with towels in my school house for the use of the scholars. (Nov 28th) And it was the first question that I asked in regard to the character of the colored children, Are they neat? You proceed to draw comparisons between myself and the ladies with  It is my pleasure to labor and live. That you did this in a most friendly and christian spirit and in the discharge of a duty, I am aware; and I so accept it. That there was also some apparent ground for such remark is also true. But had you been acquainted with me I am sure you would not have made unfavorable comparisons If there is one man in society, more than another who recognizes the force of social relations, I am that man I believe these may be a jewel in a rough casket, but the casket may be so unseemly as to entirely hide the gem. There may be genuine principles and even Christianity in an unpolished man and yet, that principle be shown to such a disadvantage through a rough exterior as to almost or quite lose its force. No man, and especially no Missionary who understands the meaning of that scripture\" ye--harmless as doves,\"--or that other--\"Charity does not behave itself unseemly\" can be less than a Gentleman if true to his convictions. And no man as a mere philosopher can afford to dispense with that which gives him such power over others--A dignified and christian politiness. And if you are impressed with the importance of such a quality,  among a friendly people, and in a mere business capacity what would be your feelings on the subject were you among persons who delight to find occasion against you, and acting in a moral sphere. No man but a gentleman would be successful here. I repeat it. No man man but a thorough Gentleman will be successful as a missionary at the South The man who is capable of doing much good at the north where he is known, and without \"polished manners\" to a high degree--Would do much anything here by such a deficiency Politeness commands respect and enforces Christianity even among enemies. A good judge of Human nature is also essential to success--\"Be ye wise as serpents\"--was written emphatically for Southern Missionaries. And alas! for a Home without politiness If Christianity does one thing more than another it improves that place where men become familiar and mingles common interests, called Home I appreciate the force of your remarks in regard to \"society\" as no man has a right to be inattentive to the interests of others at home while he there holds so much power; either for good or evil, for pleasure or pain. Dec 1 I am frequently attacked by men of southern principle, in regard to the propriety of educating the Freedmen; the justice of the institution of slaver, etc. and although I have never commenced a discussion with any upon this subject, or conversed with any but apparent gentlemen, yet I have had to meet much prejudice both against the work and against those engaged in it from first to last. Now it requires all the qualities of a Gentleman to get along with these men, altho\\', they do not often call us out on these subjects. But frankness and calm christian dignity with accurate reasoning commands their respect and leaves them \"Non plused\" But do you ask how all this agrees with my appearance at the Rooms on the morning on which we left N. Y. I answer. 1st My mother was opposed to me going and refused to assist in preparing my clothes. 2nd my coat did not fit--about the neck 3rd being at work out of the vilage I had not been \"barbered\" as I had not time after receiving orders to the Rooms--And covered with dust from my long rise with dirty colar and loose coat and frizzled hair, I was introduced to the Ladies. Now under the same circumstances would Mr Hunt, have been less awkward. At this moment also my stock dropped from my neck, having been put on in a hurry. As to spelling. I shall always be mortified by it as I was allowed in childhood to spell wrong. And tho\\' since taught better yet no sooner do I become engaged in thought than I forget spelling and return to the old habit without knowing it till after the letter is written. I remember being chagrined by finding that I had once addressed you as Esq instead of Rev I have spoken foolishly as did St Paul of old.',\n",

The Court directed him to be discharged upon the Peace Warrant, but retained in Jail to await the order of the Supt. of the Lunatic Asylum. The sheriff had the papers he sent them to Dr. Stribling of Staunton who reports that there is room for him and the sheriff has made arrangements to take him to Staunton in a few days. He is a poor unfortunate man, is violent, and is firmly impressed with the idea that two men are attemting to take his life - one is said to be dead and the other not in the Commonwealth. It is not rare for insane men to complain of ill treatment. W. P. [unclear: Kidd] is the jailor, Schuler G. Harris and Robt. Johnson are gentlemen in the neighborhood of Fabers Mills where he lived. I do not presume that these gentlemen were aware that he had written to Governor Wells.

The commission was composed of three intelligent justices, one if not two of them were physicians. You may rely upon it there is no purpose to ill treat but to benefit this unfortunate man. He has no estate and is a mechanic and sympathy not unkindness was manifested to him. As is generally the case he is unwilling to be taken to the Asylum.',\n",

I am very well at present, was not for several days after, I overlook my company, which is now stationed 4 miles from Martinsburg, Beverly Co. some 6 miles from the Potomac; we are getting pretty close to the Yankees. But the closer we apprach them the faster they retreat. I like camp life very much if it was not for cooking. I wish you could come down & cook for me. I have engaged one young lady to fight for me. She was so kind & patriotic as to offer her services, & of course I could not refuse. I think most of the ladies are more patriotic than some of the Gentlemen. I met with a great many of my old acquaintances in the different regiments stationed here, which makes it more pleasant than it otherwise would be. They all seem very cheerful & lively, and most anxious to come into deadly conflict with their enemy. I know I dont want to fight. I'm a great lover of peace, I would give a million, if I had it, to be in Lincoln's position one day, peace would come, if I could bring it. I abhor the idea of war, & believed once that it was morally wrong on all occasions. But this war is certainly a holy & just one, on our side; the other is none else than unconstitutional, brought on by wicked usurpation of power, but from present indications & from reports now current, the prospect for peace is flattering. I only hope the present Congress will settle the whole affair. It is the will of our maker to have peace at all times, if people would not become so rebellious, he would not chastise so severely as by bringing war upon them. These have been in times past & must needs now be. Two ladies from Washington came to Martinsburg, stated that the Cabinet were writing out a proclamation of peace. I dont know how they know it, but suppose they had some good reason for believing so. There are some hard customers here, care for nothing whatever, themselves nor any one else. I would rather be at College about this time, at my studies. I hated worse to leave them, than I hated to leave my friends. I had hoped the whole time & still hope that this terrible calamity will be averted from our once glorious country, but now agitated & dissevered. I was well taken care of from Staunton to Winchester by two young ladies, I  recon  [unclear: recon] you think they had a heap to do. I did not start as soon from home as I had expected to do, from some mismanagement.

He is well, or at least I've heard nothing the contrary. 3 of our men were shot a few days ago, one by [unclear: a] Yankee & the other two accidentally. All of them still living but badly wounded. We have religious services in our company every night, conducted by different members of the company, had two sermons last Sabbath. Have no regular chaplain, as I know of.

As to the crop of Corn & Potatoes raised by Toby Taylor (Ellens Husband) I will say that I had to study awhile before I knew what it meant; then I recollected that told Toby that he might have a piece of corn (about an Acre) if he would attend to it; but unfortunately for him he took sick and died before the corn was gathered. I also told him he might have a piece of ground for Potatoes; he planted them, and died before they came but they were never gathered in, they rotted in the ground. This you see was before the negroes were free (in 1864) so I think I am clear of that. As to Ellen's wages, I told her when she first was set free that I would give her her victuals & clothes if she would stay with me. She stayed until about 2 months ago, when she left; and now I think it would be great injustice for me to have to repay her. I sent you a note by A.

I endeavored today to make arrangements to go up home on Monday next, but failed, as some half dozen reports are yet to be made out for the war Dept & I have them in shorthand - no one else can transcribe them. I shall not be ordered away on business soon, and as quickly as I finish my work & can get leave of absence, I will be there. I sent a letter off Wednesday evening, which you doubtless got today. Dr Brown tells me he expects to go to Staunton on Monday. I may be able to get off Wednesday next; at least I hope so. Yet I know that everything will remind me of him who loved me so, and to whom I had given my heart's last devotion. I know that he alone of all others understood me, for I told and explained all to him. He loved me as he loved no one else & I was satisfied. Conversations have passed between us which are as sacred as the grave in which he sleeps. His words, his counsels and his blessings hang all around my way like golden lamps which shall never go out, but light me on till I too shall sleep and wake beside him. I know what he thought to do, even in our boyhood days when he should come of mature age. Long, long ago when we lived on Christian's creek, one night we were sleeping together in the trundle bed, before we slept there had been some talk about sending him away to Winchester to stay some time. I said that I could not bear that he should be sent away, and he put his dear little arms around me and I clasped him and the tears flowed freely. Since then we have lived in pleasantness together. Not an unkind word or feeling ever passed between us in our lives, and either of us would have suffered all for the other. May his grave never, never fade in my heart; and may my life be as pure and gentle and my final rest as glorious as his. I have been pained to hear of your feeble health yet hope that you will rally shortly; the warm weather however is so exhausting, every thing so dry and disease so prevalent. The internments in Hollywood cemetery average eighteen daily from Typhoid fever alone. Poor Mrs Yancey died of it. Mr Yancey & Mrs Hutcheson went up to his father's this morning to carry the little girl 4 months old. It is so sad. The news here is very exciting. It is said that the southerners in Baltimore rose up and helped us to take possession of the city. All is excitement there and it is said that secession flags wave from one end of Baltimore to the other-Nothing from Washington City. I am glad to hear that Mary Lou is better. It is strange to me that these abscesses continue to form. I suppose Zeke was not taken off by the Yankees on their late visit as you nothing has been said about it in the letters from home.

During the day, when my mind is absorbed with business, its perplexities & annoyances, I do not so sensibly experience that you & my children are from me, but when night begins to settle around me in glooming silence, there is an aching void. My thoughts revert to you & them. I wish I could but hear your sweet [unclear: ceurding] angelic voice & the merry laugh of my merry & interesting children. God bless them! Do they ever speak of their absent Papa, and express the desire to see him? That laughing, merry, ever moving little [unclear: Olie]--How I miss her as mornings breaks into my chamber!

But this is indulging in reflections that make me sad: the distance is short, separating us. The time I trust will not be long before I shall see you, kiss you and embrace you in my arms.

Says she loves you as a sister, and fears her visit to you was not as pleasant to you as it should have been- -&c. I assured her to the contrary. I think she is a noble girl--& her resolve to teach, to be useful, to live to a purpose is the strongest evidence of her elevation of character & nobleness of soul.

If we go, you must, if you expect to return home the last of the month, make your arrangements to return the day after the wedding, for we have been retained in the big suit of McDowell Exon vs Hugh John Crawford, which may be called up the first day of the court. I expect to go to Roanoke in a few days, probably Friday. If not then, on Monday next. If we go [unclear: South], it will be out of our power to do so, until after the rising of the Court.

For I would not be the means of divulging it for the world. Sandy has become very cool towards us. Never comes to our office, & never calls us into his.

To us it is different; we feel it, oh! how deeply we feel it, may be seen by the many sad attentive countenances that now surround me: and still more plainly have we seen it in the gentle words and looks of the last few weeks.

Can we ever forget the merry old times we have had in the hall together, the many delightful walks we have taken, and all those pleasures which ever throw a charm around school life? No! each spot is consecratad by the remembrance of some pleasant scene that occurred there, and our hearts will be forever bound to these old familiar walls by all the endearing recollections of you.

When I can get a chance I will send them to you. I was sorry that I had not a chance to buy and send many things, but I had not. There are many things there to sell. Love and good wishes to all.

Marched again on 16th to a point five miles beyond Orange C.H., and in sight of the Yankee Camp and remained there four days drawing and cooking rations almost every day so as to keep three days provisions on hand. Yesterday we again took up the line of march and advanced towards the enemy, our route being to the right of the railroad, and encamped near a little town called Stephensburg. This morning morning we took an early start—crossed the Rail Road at Brandy Station and are now within two miles of the Rappihannock. The enemy are on the further bank for the purpose of preventing or retarding our advance, and considerable cannonading has been going on across the stream. The Yankees retrea ted from Culpeper C.H. yesterday lea ving twelve hundred wounded men. A cavalry skirmish occurred yesterday, in which sixty prisoners were taken and the Yankees routed. Most of the dwelling hou ses along the road have been deserted by the whites and left to the fate of war. The country down here is generally flat and poor, but in the neighborhood of Or ange C.H. are many splendid fields of corn, which continually tempt the soldier to trespass. Our cavalry and some artil lery have succeeded in crossing the river[unclear: .] Our cavalry have just captured twenty five Yankees and two Ambulances. Gen Lee is here in command. Gen Stuart and his Cavalry are here.[2]  I sent to Waynesboro last week by Mr Da vidson $2006 $206.00; $94.00 for Andrew and the remainder for myself. You take your pay out of it, and as I am not getting home very fast will have to make the trade in pants we spoke of, which will leave me in your debt—$21.00. I would like to have the pants by the first chance you have of sending them. Mr. Hill declines going in as a substitute[3] and I have heard nothing more of the man of 2nd Regt.; dont think he has ever returned.

Please say in your next letter whether you got the money; disliking to carry it—I thought best to send it even by indirect means. On Mon day All our wagons were taken from us except enough to have cooking utencils and officers baggage and our mess box es thrown out and bags substituted. So we have to tote our little all on our backs, which with gun cartridge box and haversack containing three days rations is quite burdensome.[5] Four or five boys broke down yesterday. Tom White Jno and Henry Myres are in a very fair way of getting transfers of to Cav alry.[6] I forgot to say that James White told me that there were two men in his company who would probably be discharged who might be got as substitutes. I will soon need a hat and would like to have a pocket-ink stand and penn holder if they this can be bought. Will also take one of your homemade pocket books if you can m have an extra one or can convenient ly make one. Andrew had better have his knapsack as small as possible, they can be drawn here.

       " 'p022_013': 'In order to show the exact condition of Bureau Affairs in this District, I have the honor to submit a special report on the subject of its organization. Sub-District \"A\" In Alleghany County there is a [unclear: Sergeant] as Agent who reports \"everything working smoothly\" - \"there are but few out of employment, or unable\" \"to support themselves - the citizens are well disposed \"and willing to give the freedmen a fair chance.\" In Bath County a Sergeant is acting agent and reports \"everything working well, but some are inclined to defraud the freedmen. There is quite a large percentage that will have to be looked after and helped as the cold weather approaches.\" Of Botetourt County Asst Supt Tubbs says \"It is difficult to make any [unclear: correct] report of this county as I have no one in it to attend to the affairs, and cannot get any one.\" \"I have not heard from the detail you wrote to Genl Curtis for therefore my hands are tied.\" Having previously asked Genl Curtis to send men to Fincastle with an officer under instructions to furnish a detail at the request of Lt. Tubbs, and duly notified him to that effect, I have now instructed Lt Tubbs to at once apply for the detail and report result. I respectfully suggest the transfer of this county to the Seventh District, as it may be easily controlled from Lynchburg. Of Rockbridge County the Assist Supt, Lt. Tubbs says \"There are a few [unclear: people] here that are well-disposed, and willing to assist the freedmen in making an honorable living; but the majority of them are selfish, stubborn, mean, and try to take every advantage of the freedmen that they can. Occasionally one is bold enough to say plainly, that as soon as the yankees leave they will shoot them like dogs. The Union sentiment is so small that it would require something more thorough than a [unclear: Pennsylvania] search warrant to find it &c. Sub-Dist \"B\" Of Augusta County, Mr Tukey Assist Supt says \"the condition of affairs of the Bureau is not as good as I would wish, and yet perhaps as good as could be expected when one considers the prejudice of the citizens against the freedmen, and the lack of facilities for executing the regulations of the Bureau, meaning want of Cavalry to send for parties at a distance. I find, almost invariably, that the disposition to abase the freedmen comes from the lower and more ignorant class of people, those who were non-slave holders before the War. [unclear: G--]  have already developed the fact that the intelligence of the freedmen is much higher than that of their fellows in Eastern Virginia where schools were opened in 1861, and I attribute this to a higher intelligence of the Whites and a more lenient policy towards their slaves.\" In Highland County Mr Tukey says there are probably not more than one hundred freedmen and that he is promised a detail with which he will attempt the census. Only one case of destitution reported to him and that was provided for by the civil authorities. Sub-Dist \"C\" In Rockingham County I have been unable to accomplish much of anything. It is in this Military District of the Shenandoah, but the distance of the County seat (67 miles) and the lack of transportation and obstacles to the sustanance of troops there which cannot now be overcome, and an officer or agent of this Bureau on duty there without troops would be of about as much use now as if sent on the same mission a year or more ago. If there was any Cavalry in this command, an attempt would be made to obtain the census, but as it is there is little possibility of its being taken. In Page County there are no troops and no agent and if one should be sent unattended I doubt he would have time to make a report. It is  a mountainous region and off the mail route. But the  of the   stations at Woodstock the census was nearly completed, and a wholesale [unclear: influence] [unclear: extent], so that the freedmen are not liable to be molested or interfered with, and a large portion of the county is within [unclear: march] of Woodstock. In Shenandoah County, at Woodstock I have a new officer, Lt. Goble who relieved Lt. D. A. Smith in charge of the Sub District and whose short experience does not enable him to make a definite report. From Lt Smith - a good officer, taken from me to be made A.A.A.G. of this Military District, I learn that the freedmen are doing very will. All at work for good wages, and that there is generally, no disposition among the citizens to treat them unfairly, as they view fairness. The Whites are an intensely disloyal people, in real sentiment, and were the protection of this Bureau to be withdrawn, the freedmen would be treat pretty much as they used to be. The census of the County is nearly completed, and as there are troops at Woodstock, it will doubtless be ready for copying as soon as I receive the [unclear: pr----d] blanks. A board of agents is organized, but no report of cases tried has yet been . Sub Dist. \"D\" Frederick County, Mr McKenzie reports as in a flourishing and prosperous condition. \"Most of the Whites are disposed to deal fairly and honorably with the freedmen. The demand for labor exceeds the supply. All of the freedmen being profitably employed except the aged, helpless persons and some children to whom rations are issued in part, the authorities not being prepared to provide for their paupers.\" In Clarke County there is a Sergeant as Agent, and Mr McKenzie says \"Although the people are not so well disposed towards the freedmen, yet they seem willing to obey the laws and orders of the Government.\" - \"probably because they dare not disobey them. Labor is even more scarce in this county than in Frederick, ten (10) and twelve (12) dollars per month is offered for the year. The withdrawal of the Bureau from this county would, I think, subject the freedmen to all manner of abuse and persecution from their former masters.\" In Warren County there are neither troops nor agent, and for similar reasons to those given in relation to Rockingham. The Assist Supt says \"The sending of an agent supported by a detachment of troops would be of great benefit to the freedmen in that benighted region as I am afraid that in distant parts of this county they are subject to [unclear: imposition] and actions of injustice which are not brought to my notice owing to the great distance from this, the nearest military Post.\" Sub-Dist. \"E\" In Berkeley County there was a sergeant as agent, but he had scarcely begun his work when he with his company were sent to the Kanawah Valley in West Va. The freedmen are well treated and at work for fair wages. An agent will be stationed at Martinsburg, and the census completed if possible. The board of agents will I think be established there without difficulty. In Jefferson County, Lt. Smith says that the freedmen are doing pretty well and are generally at work for usual wages but that the whites are unwilling to concede any rights or privileges other than those enjoyed (?) before the war, and if the troops should be removed they would suffer petty persecutions and much ill treatment, particularly at Harpers Ferry and at Charleston. From this place each named the soldiers were withdrawn shortly after I had procured them to be stationed there, and just as I had arranged for the establishment of a school, to which the whites were bitterly opposed, and which I think could hardly be maintained without the presence of a supporting force. I have had great difficulty in obtaining a proper officer for this Sub District, but believe that now to have been overcome, and anticipate an [unclear: effective] superintendence of Bureau affairs in Sub Dist. E. All of which is respectfully submitted and I remain, Colonel',\n",

I am happy to say we suffered but little, only one of our \"gallant band\" was wounded, (although we were under a heavy Artillery fire all the time) Namely Cyrus Lotts who had his little finger shot off by the accidental discharge of his musket in the night whilst getting a drink of water. In regard to the loss of the enemy I am unable to speak at present _ as I did not get a chance to visit the battle field; but judging fom northern Journals, they suffered a heavy loss. They admit a loss of 15000, & say that it was the greatest defeat of the war. Great dissatisfaction is prevailing at this time in the Lincoln government & it is to be hoped they will burst up in a row.

The most we can do now is to visit the children at home and help them what we can to do their own sewing The day schools now no about as follows 400+35+40+50 and they [unclear: ar] regular for the most part. But I wish to call your attention to the matter of sending clothing. As yet we have received none except one box belonging to Miss Williams and we have used this with great care, and it is all gone now. There is but little destitution here, that needs attention, as I am convinced that it is better for the freedmen to help themselves where they can, than to be helped. But there are a few cases of extreme destitution, mostly among children many of whom have lost one or both parents, I know of some 30 children who are shoeless and otherwise very thinly clad. There are other grown people who would pay something for old clothes, if they had them. We have tried to fix up some of these children with a few remnants that were left of Miss Williams box.--but it amounts to very little. Now if you could send us a few things till I can get this \"Benevolent Society\" among the colored people in operation it would be a great relief to the poor John Scott Staunton Va Jan 11/66 After waiting from 2 to 4 weeks for the book dealer to get some Arithmetic, I sent to the Rooms for 50 copies of either Greenleafs or Thompsons written arithmetic, as the merchant here informed me that he was unable to get any. But since I wrote you he has unexpectedly to himself received some of [unclear: Rays] Arithmetic, so that we can buy of him as a last resort,-- if you have not sent, and do not think best to send those ordered. But the price of these books is so much higher that I know you can send them from N. Y. and pay the freight or express cheaper than they can be obtained here. Please write, or send the books immediately--The price of these is 85 per copy.',\n",

We hadent gone far from Orange CH before we met with a squad of Yankey Cavalry which made us leave the road and go to the woods. They then pursued us a mile or two where we lost sight of them. We then came to the road leading to Richmond to the right of the central railroad where we camped for the night. We got up the next morning and went out of the woods to the railroad where we came to a company of about 50 or 60 men tearing up the railroad. They saw my white horse. Just we turned back and 2 of them pursued us about a mile when we came to a halt and when they came up in sight we rode towards them then they ran back about a mile up the main road. We then met some citizens who had just left Louisa CH where the Yankees were tearing up the track and were coming towards James R. We then came on to Columbia and tried to cross the river but there were so many people to cross that we could not have gotten over in time to have made our escape. I and Mr. Lee went out to watch them approach. We had been out about 3 hours & 1/2. About 11 oclock in the night when their advanced guard of about 100 men came up we went and gave information to the Citizens. We then started down the tow path towards Richmond. Had gone about 2 miles and and were right upon them before we heard any thing from them. I thought then I would be a prisoner in 10 minutes but we crossed the small part of James R and got over on the Island and happened to come to a mans private ferry who got us over and saved us from their mercy. They have burned all the bridges over the canal and all the barns and stables and every thing like food on the other side of the River from here. They tried to destroy the aqueduct over the Rivanna but did not succeed. They shot a young man over the river yesterday 3 times and then cut his head off and roled him in the canal right before his mother & Fathers eyes. I am right well. Love to all.

Va. which includes the counties of Augusta and Highland. Numerous calls are daily made at this office by Freedpeople, to obtain settlement of disputed accounts for labor, or to ask aid to compel payment of wages acknowledged to be due. I still find in a majority of these cases, a trivial money balance to the credit of the laborer, or a claim against him for over payment in produce or goods, which it is difficult to refute, by reason of his having no counter account of his own to show. Few contracts for labor by the year are being made at this office, partly owing to unwillingness of employers to come to the Bureau, and partly to indisposition of laborers to make contracts for the year. This last is much to be regretted, and I use all exertion to induce the Freedmen to make permanent engagements, but in most cases, without success. Wages offered are about as last year, $8 c $10 per month for good hands, with rations house and fuel. Boys are little wanted. There have been no special breaches of the peace during this month, by or against Freedmen on the part of the Whites. In the case of assault with a hatchet by John [unclear: McNeish] (cold) upon Moses Lowell (cold), McNeish was fined $1 only by the magistrate and released, but next morning I brought the case to the notice of the Mayor, and he had McNeish rearrested and held to answer indictment at March court. Political matters between white and colored are quiet, but I can report little or no change of feeling. The conservative organization is active and general, every preparation being made to defeat the Constitution, no matter what it may be, but so far no impression has been made upon the masses of colored voters, who see now quite clearly that the success of the conservatives will result in depriving them of all privileges of freedom. Temperance organizations cannot it seems be effected, but there is little drunkeness among Freedmen, except in the country near distilleries or low [unclear: groggers] in town. The colored churches do not take up the Temperance movement earnestly, if at all, and until this is done I do not look for much progress in organizing societies. Both town and county authorities seem to extend impartial relief to the poor Freedpeople, and since the settlement of the question as to who should furnish temporary relief, there is little ground for complaint.',\n",

Association over any other society. One of the leading men remarked a few days ago that \"If you all\\'s Society dont help us build, its no use for any other to try\" The moment Bracketts name is mentioned they shake their heads and say \"He\\'ll bear a heap of watchin\" They think he tried to get undue possession of their building when here (I dont think he did) but they do not favor him--or the Presbyterians who are at work in the north part of the valley under Oscar M Warring and who I hear also have an eye to this place. 3rd To remain might prevent some of these unruly colored people from doing some mischief which they would if left to themselves After all if you think best for me to remain please answer by return mail These are all the facts that have come up that I can think of to aid you in deciding I want to have here Monday if I can The Measles have made havoc in school for two weeks, and the Fairs have also taken away nearly as many more as disease Near what St is Nelson Place so that, if the Ladies come in to NY at night, or near night they may know where to go.

I went into Fredericksburg for the first time, called on the Mayor, most of the people are still away and the town is deserted save by a few men and our soldiers \"on duty\" there The people are still moving away the wrecks of their household property, but as the Mayor remarked, \"there is scarce one thing that makes life pleasant and comfortable that the Vandals have left behind or have not destroyed. He said there was hardly a house that had not a bale or shell hole in it & our men have picked up tons of unexploded shells & solid shot. I saw houses completely riddled, roof sides & ends and perfectly untenable. I had no idea before how a bombarded sacked city would look and I do not wish to see it again, unless it would be right to sack Washington, that sink of iniquity, after bombarding it with all \"old Abe\\'s\" horrid crew in it. The river is quite narrow there and the pickets can sit on the opposite banks and converse There is no firing of pickets at one another now and our men are throwing up breastworks in easy musket range of the enemy -- in fact one of the pickets called to our men, saying, \"You needn\\'t be throwing up dirt there, we don\\'t intend to come that way again\". I hardly think the enemy intends to come over here again, though they may. Col. Faulkner says all these elections in the North mean peace, he was in prison there until a year ago and some of the men that have since been elected to office there or are candidates, were in with him and they told him how they intended to proceed until they got the government into their hands when they would make peace, though he does not look for it until Abe\\'s time expires, though he thinks hostilities will cease after next June. Write to me often my Darling One, for the mails have to be depended on now our line of courriers is stopped Put on the letters to Guinea\\'s station P.O. in addition to what You usually do. I shall be quite sure to come home before the sale so as to be there and we will keep what we want and I will arrange for garden, pigs &c.

Instances of this character which have come to my notice incline me to this opinion. The unmanly, ungenerous and I may add outrageous spirit manifested by many white men in settling their accounts with their colored employees seems to demonstrate the hatred and entire disregard for the welfare of the freedmen entertained by their more fortunate neighbors. There are of course honorable men among them but they can only be classed as the exceptions. As the white man is superior to the freedmen in point of intellect and self government every advantage is taken of the ignorance of the latter in making their settlements. Many colored men have suffered gross injustice, at the hands of their Employers in this manner. No matter how just may be the account, some imaginary or trivial grievance is brought into requisition which nearly or quite counterbalances it - and the colored man anxious for a settlement of some kind readily yields, and he soon finds that if he is not indebted to his supposed debtor he has little or nothing coming to him. As far as my observation has extended, I believe the freedmen, with few exceptions are an industrious & hardworking class willing and anxious to do all in their power to Elevate themselves from their past condition and become self-supporting - but they have difficulties to overcome and obsticles to surmount which the white man has not - hence their comparatively slow progress made in their advancement. Their sudden transition from Slavery to freedom found them without knowledge, property, or even implements of agriculture, with nothing but a strong arm and will to protect and sustain them against popular prejudice - and with which to gain a livelihood. Should the Bureau be withdrawn from their aid and protection at this time, while such an antagonism of feeling exists between the races, I fear the result - as far as the promotion and welfare of the colored man is concerned. I had received the impression when I first came to this Division that the necessary preparations had been made for the opening of the Colored Schools for their Fall term, but their failure of to commence the session when the proper time arrived left me to inquiry, when to my surprise, I found nothing had been done in that direction. No charitable Association has, as yet, interested itself toward the support of a school in this Division for the coming Fall & Spring terms, I therefore urged the Colored people in this vicinity to call meetings and take such means and support a school on their own responsibility. This has been done in two or three localities, but it was found that their poverty prevented their doing more than paying the teacher's board. One school, supported entirely by freedmen, and taught by a colored girl was opened on the 21st inst. at Arbor Hill, Augusta County, with this exception, there are at present no day schools in operation in my Division. In Waynesboro, Augusta County, the colored people are striving to put their church in a condition that a school may be opened there by the 15th proximo in case a teacher and books can be provided. In fact several schools might be opened in this Division during the coming winter, if it were in the power of the Bureau or some charitable association to aid them in procuring suitable school rooms and books for use of scholars. As to Intemperance, the colored population seem to be almost entirely free from it. Their failings and evil proclivities seem to develop in another direction, that of choosing mates without performing the proper marriage ceremony etc. etc.\",\n",

That which I complain of as being intolerable is horse stealing and the trouble is to get officials on the task in time and not in any want of of promptness on their part. In Some neighborhoods in Augusta County the citizens are forming themselves into vigilance committees for their own protection against this nuisance, and we were about doing the same, and I had written to the Genl as one of the Committee for instructions not wishing to go into an arrangement of that kind unless with the sanction of the Commandment of this Dist horse stealing has highly become intolerable here a short time since there were five horses Stolen from this immediate neighborhood in one night from different persons the time that would, necessarily have been consumed in getting officials would have enabled them (the theives) to make their escape but by pursuing them at once they were over taken in the north mountain and the horses recovered. But for want of arms the theives escaped which is to be regreted by every law abiding citizen.

       " 'p042_049': 'On last Thursday I recd. your sweet letter of the 10 th  and was glad to learn that you are again at home where you will write to me by every mail. I thought there was a tone of sadness apparent in your letter when I first read it that made me uneasy lest there might be moments when you doubted whether your happiness was assured in our prospective marriage. On a closer study of your letter I think perhaps I may trace its tone to the very natural regret you experienced in leaving Brunswick with the Conviction that it was the last time you would ever be one of the gay young parties that so grace the Society of that pleasant old County. And that whilst you regretted the probable loss forever of this source of happiness I have no right to conclude that you felt misgivings about the future. You refer to the limited opportunities we have had to become well acquainted. That is true, but so far as I am concerned I trust so implicitly in my knowledge of human nature, and my ability to read a woman\\'s character, that before I had been 24 hours in your Society I saw & felt that you possessed every element of \"head & heart\" to make any man happy as your husband, who had heart & soul enough to appreciate you. I knew that if I could win your love I should find in you one of the dearest and best little wives man was ever blessed with, and I needed no further acquaintance to induce me to give you my whole heart, and ask for yours in return. You have not had the experience of the world that I have, and I do not wonder at your desire to see more of me, and to know me better before you sever all the tenderest ties of life, and Come with me amongst strangers. It is my thorough knowledge of how great the sacrifice - and how perilous the step - a young girl makes in marrying, that will make me always the tenderest of husbands to you. I will aim to make you trust me, and lean upon me with that perfect confidence that will dispel every feeling of apprehension from your mind, so that when you pronounce the solemn vows that make you mine forever - adopt my name - sever your connection with home & family - give to father & mother - sisters & brothers your farewell kiss, and leave all to \"cleave unto\" me, you will feel that in my love, my devotion, and strong protecting arm, a new world of happiness is opened up to you that is more than an equivalent for that you leave behind. The more I can be with you before our marriage - the more you can see of me the more certainly do I hope to bring you to look forward to the day of our union with impatient delight, & not of anxiety. The still continued absence in Europe of Col McKaye, and the delay of Col Flournoy to join me here, renders the day of my return to Virginia still uncertain. I do not yet despair of getting home this month but I am not sure of it. Should I be delayed till after the holydays, the I will so arrange my business here as to make it unnecessary for me to come back from Virginia till Spring, when you will come along. I often picture to myself the pleasure it will give me to have you here to caress & pet, when I come up town from a hard day\\'s work, and in your sweet society to forget for a while the din and uproar of this great bray thing in which I daily move. Amongst all the hundreds of thousands of men and women around me, you alone in some bright cheerful room, will constitute my world of happiness. And together we will go out and be amused by the throng in which we shall have no interest, beyond that they afford us a mere spectacle to gaze upon. You cannot realize how utterly indifferent I feel towards the great mass of mankind. Every day\\'s experience but confirms me in the opinions of years, that there is but one mode of existence in this world that satisfies our natural craving for happiness - and that is in the married relation, founded upon perfect love & confidence between husband & wife. A man & woman can make for each other of this world, a foretaste of that more perfect existence hereafter, that we all look forward to so hopefully. On the other hand they may render life a burden almost too intolerable to be borne. I dont believe much in any middle ground between happiness and misery in married life. My experience in that relation was one of supreme happiness. I can well conceive how it could, under less favorable circumstances, have been one of wretchedness, if it had lacked the essential foundation of profound mutual respect & perfect love. I am glad to see from your last letter that you think so gravely of the important step you are so soon to take. It proves that you appreciate its importance, and that unless you felt perfectly satisfied in regard to your own heart you would not incur the tremendous consequences of an irrevocable ceremony. The more gravely and seriously you think of it now, the better assured am I, that your mind will never change its deliberate decisions. I wish I could be with you Christmas. I shall think all day of you, and I belive you will not forget me. I look forward a year, & see you a happy little wife when this festive seeason comes around again. And may it always be a merry and a happy time with you. I shall write today to Sister Lou. Miss Ella will not write to me I suppose. I am pained to learn from you that her health is still so delicate. I appreciate on that account your anxiety to gratify her wish to be present at our marriage, and I will not urge you too much against your will to forego that pleasure, merely to gratify me. Therefore it is I leave open the question of \"a day,\" till we meet.',\n",

We are all well at present feel quite pert after the cold rain we had yesterday I hope it was not as cold down the vally as it was here I would be rather uncomfortable without fire Tell John Beard that he did not take all the rain away with him this time & that he must have left all the cold behind him.

He got to Staunton Wednesday came home Thursday night & started back the next Morning for Winchester but was at church Sunday. I heard of his saying he had the offer of an office in the militia. I suppose if he can get one higher in the militia than that in your company he will take it if not he will have that to fall back on I dont know whether he has gone this week or not but if not I think it would be a pretty good plan not to let him have that chance & if he cant get suited here make him go as a private I think people here in the valley are mighty stuck up anyway, unlike the people further south they cant come down a peg if it can possibly be helped Nearly all of any pretentious [unclear: stall at least great] & you know there are a good many of that are ripping around to get an office.

They would rather go in the militia if they have to go as they are only taken for six months whilst the volunteers are taken for the time the war lasts.

Bob & Bil Stuart are said to be two of the bravest men out there & some of the Pingah set are said to have gained more honor that day than they ever did before in their lives. The wagons that started last have got back they were in Beverly time of the fight but all escaped, the ones that started the day before did not have as good luck I believe they are getting back with their horses but their wagons were taken. I think Scott ought to have his life taken for not taking part in that fight or giving those that were amunition when his men wanted to go on & help He must be as great a coward as Jim Strain who would not let that company know about it till it was too late. Report has good news for the South from the fight at Manassas Junction on last week Old Scott is reported to have said that he was never whipped, before, in his life We have heard nothing yet from the fight on Sunday it is supposed that it was at the Junction If your company was in Johnson's command that went to that place give us full particulars.

Of course the political aspect of the country did not escape observation, and all concurred in the opinion that the conservative opposition ought to raise its standard & stand by it. To the question, What ought now to be done? I replied that the conservative party ought, in my judgment, to call an early National Convention, nominate candidates for whom moderate Republicans can vote, men in whom all true national conservative men have confidence, & then let the Republicans take what course they may think proper. Such a nomination would, I [unclear: thot], secure the election of the ticket, & the eventual union of all, save the ultraists of the Opposition, North & South. But how shall that Convention be called, & by whom? Was the next inquiry. My reply was, \"by the Opposition State Convention, to be held at Richmond, Va. on the 14th Dec. The opinion seemed to be concurred in that by some such course we should take possession of the track and by presenting an unexceptionable ticket compel the Republican party to adopt it. The outbreak at Harper\\'s Ferry must exert no small influence upon political movements. It is a [unclear: chuk] upon the Republicans, & must make them more ready to pliable, yielding and conciliatory;--less audacious, confident & exacting. In this state of things it seems to me that boldness, decision & prompt action on our part, is the dictate of sound policy. Timidity & hesitation always invite aggression and encourage assumption. I should be glad to have your views on this subject. In regard to candidates; I have no personal preferences, except one, & that I will not name to you. Among a number of good men, we must be governed by policy in the selection of candidates. The Blairs, it is well for us to bear in mind, are for Mr. Bates; and so is Mr. Colfax of Ind. & many of the prominent Republicans of the West. That being the case, would they not exert a strong influence, should he be placed in nomination as I have indicated, in inducing the party of which they are leaders, to adopt our ticket? especially if some Republican, say Foot or Fessenden, were placed on the ticket? What I rather fear is, that your convention, excited by the late scenes & outrages, will adopt some resolution, or give expression to some sentiment not calculated to \"turn away wrath,\" but to invite by \"touching the raw\" of the North. I hope, however, you will be able to prevent this. Mr. Hodge told me he had addressed a letter to you at Richmond, & was desirous to hear from you in reply.

Some of them seems to think that we have to go to Winchester and some thinks that we will go to Staunton, but I don't know how it will be for there is so much news in camp. We expect a fight here of before long. Captain Long came to our cabin a few minutes ago and told us to be in readiness. You must excuse my bad writing as I am in a hurry and have no time to spend and bad ink and paper. Dear and Dearest wife, you wanted to know if I was trying to get religion or not. I have been tryhing and I intend to try all that I can, but I tell you it is a hard place here in camp. I will tell you more about it the next time. You will please excuse me for this time, so nothing more but I will remain your affectionate husband until death. God bless you. H. H. Dedrick to wife. Dear Lizza I will write a few more lines to let you know how our scouts come out that went down at Greenbrier River this morning. They come across of some yankies and they killed two and took two prisoners and none of our men hurt. I saw David Kennedy a few minutes ago. He is well, he told me to give his best respects to you all and that he was very sorry to hear that Uncle Sam had lost his children. He told me to tell you that he had wrote Lizza a letter but he had not sent it, and he was glad that I told him that she was dead and would not send it. Hiram Coyer and Ben Wright has left here. They left Thursday night and David Robertson and Frank Bush left last Wednesday morning. They will fare badly I think. Tell all of the folks how I am and give my love to all my inquiring friends. I must bring my scribble to a close. May god bless you all. You will please excuse my bad writing for I have bad ink and bad paper and it is dark.

They bring in a great many peaches chickens & they get them off the Yankee Farms in Fairfax. Well I have rec'd a commission at last as a 2nd Lieut so whenever I get tired of soldiering I can resign & come home which I think I shall do in a few weeks. Our company are generally well. Marshall Hanger has been loafing around here & has never joined our company. He is going home today or tomorrow. As Augusta has furnished her quota of volunteers the militia will not be needed. Our Army is camped in every direction from the Junction. Jacksons Brigade is in camp about 3/4 of a mile below Centreville which is 6 or 7 miles from the Junction. I stayed all night there with Ed Waddell. Monday night I saw John Hill. He wanted a light woolen round about & a pair pants of same quality & if you could have them made you could send them down by some of his company who have gone home on furlough. I expect their company was paid off Tuesday & John must have gotten his wages which amounted to between $20 & $40. He told that he wanted me to take his pay & send it to Pa to keep for him that he had very little use for money. Uncle Moore & Post are at Centreville. I saw Martin Yontz on Monday. He had brought a wagonload provisions down to Hamtramels Guards. He says our folks are all well. I sent word by him to Grand Pa that you are all well. I don't think there will be a battle for a good while perhaps 2 months. Yes we have about eighty-five men in our company. Lib Davis came down with me & Martin Palmer got here yesterday. There is still 2 of our boys left in Augusta Henry Miller & George Layman. Well Ma I don't believe I need anything at present. I will send this letter by Marshall Hanger or Dr Walker. Write soon.

We were awakened this morning by the most furious firing I ever heard. The enemy taking advantage of the fog. Charged our left centre and ran over our works capturing some prisoners and 18 pieces of Artillery, but our gallant boys reformed and recovered everything, except the prisoners - don't know how many of them. Among them however was Genl. Ed Johnson and Genl. George Stuart - for eight hours the fight raged with a fury I have never heard surpassed. The enemy attacking our lines again and again, but thanks to the God of battles, every time repulsed with  . A  pray silently for deliverance. As the sun came out about noon and good news came in, I felt better tonight without knowing the extent of our loss. Which however is said to be very light, as our men fought behind breast works.

Some by Refferees and some are still pending settlement. The White Citizen seem to think that the Black Man has no right to complain of his wrongs, no matter how grievous they may be he must bear them all in silence, and if he ventures to make them known it is a heinous offence for which he must be brutally knocked down and beaten with the first thing that can be gotten hold of. This is the rule. I am glad to say that there are honorable exceptions to it, and am inclined to the opinion that the old prejudices are slowly wearing away.

       " 'p008_021': ' You will perceive by  the heading of this, that we have changed  our camp a few miles. Though you need  fear no hostile demonstrations on the  account as we are yet ten or twelve  miles from the outposts. We were only  moved about five miles—only one  mile below us in Fairfax Court House[1], a  very pretty village in time of peace,  but now every where you see signs of the  presence of soldiers; a general air of neglect  and confusion, fences torn down, tents  of regiments and brigades seem in every  direction as far as can be seen through the  openings of trees. The country here is very  pretty; it is hilly, though not such high  hills as we are accustomed to in the valley,  but a succession of low parallell ridges running nearly north and south, which  render the appearance a great deal more beautiful  than the low flat country around the Junction. It is very densely wooded—mostly pine  and the whole filled up with thick under  growth, forming the very best protection  to the pickets and scouting parties, and also  a shelter for those terrible engines of destruction  (to the Yankees)-\"masked batteries.\"[2]   Troops are still concentrating between this  place and our picket lines—the main body  of the army is here—what it all means  no one of course can tell, though you may  rest assured there will be no more falling  back on the Junction, unless we are com  pletely beaten, of which however I have  little fear. I do not believe the Yankees are  ready to fight us yet—their loss was too  great on the 21st July for them to have  recovered from it so soon.[3] All military  operations are exceedingly dull  and sluggish.   We are both very well and right  pleasantly situated, if indeed a camp  life can be, at all pleasant. The camp  is a right good one, the water not quite  so good as that we left.  William Wilson[4] reached camp  this morning, from Fairfax Station  where he left the boxes, and for which  we will send tomorrow. He gave us  all the news, both from home and  Rockbridge. The Cars now run regularly  to Fairfax Station, about 3 miles from  the Court House. You will hereafter direct your letters to Fairfax Station Company I 4th Regiment Va. Volunteers.  I suppose Charles told you that  Capt. White\\'s resignation has been accepted  and that Mr. Morrison has been elected  Captain. He will make an excellent  captain. I like him very much.  He is one of the most industrious and  intelligent men I ever saw.[5]   Father wished to know that amount  coming to William from the Confederacy.[6] Capt. White is not here and Capt.  Morrison knows nothing about it, he  can only make the calculations at $11 per  month which results as follows: $31.63  up to the first of July and then 16 days  in that month $5.50 making $37.13.  The pay master made a note on the pay  rolls, that William had died and the day  of his death (16th of July) but the amount  could be drawn at anytime without  difficulty. Any statement from the Capt  could in no way, be of any service, I think.  He can find out better in Staunton than any  one here can tell him.  I am going to Fairfax Station today for the boxes.

       " 'p007_019': 'I wrote you a brief note this morning by Mr. Sheets, one of Capt. Sterrett\\'s men who went home to stay & enclosed five dollars in it for you. I intended to write you a long, long letter today, but in the morning Messengers came into camp at full speed saying that the enemy was advancing upon us & so the breast works were manned, extra scouts sent out, some placed in ambuscade, &c &c, I took a horse and became aid for the time to the Col. to convey orders &c &c, and thus the whole day was spent in the midst of excitement, the troops keeping to their arms, but as yet no attack has been made, though some look for one tonight.  There was an engagement last night between some of the scouts of our camp & those of the enemy. Three of our men were badly wounded, one shot through & through the lungs, another in the head & shoulder & another in the leg I think -- they are all doing well & it is thought they may recover. Of the enemy, two were certainly killed & likely five or six. They were in the wood & fired on our scouts who returned the fire. Our men took the pistols, gun & money of one of the men & two letters that were on him -- his name was Johns, from Ohio -- one letter was from a young sister, full of love for him, wishing he would come home, not caring whether promoted or  the war would only end so that he could  to them. It was written at Brookville. The other letter was from a cousin who seemed to think everything of the young man & prayed that he might get back -- but alas the poor fellow was destined never to see them again. The scouts said his body was the fairest of any they had ever seen.   Today our men were going along & thought the enemy was concealed near at hand in the woods, so the fired into the woods and then some of the enemy showed themselves in the road when our men fired at them & killed one certainly, & more they think. Maj. N. Tyler, one of the Eds. of the Enquirer was in command of them -- he is a good fellow & eats part of the time with us at Head Quarters, where we sup, breakfast & dine on greasy cakes of dough made into the shape of biscuits & hardened on the outside & partway through, with coffee & meat, sometimes hard crackers, now & then a taste of butter, sometimes a loaf of bread from some where as a present, or a piece of cake procured in the same way. The fare is \"pretty tough\" but borne without grumbling, & the Col. is a no. one good fellow & so are his aids, clerks &c -- but Lt. Col. Pegram came here today & assumes the command & so I do not know what will be [unclear: done] or what chance I will stand for [unclear: staying]   I will write tomorrow what the prospect is for a permanent situation during the war -- I suppose you have heard that Mr. Doyle & his two sons, Tom & __ were wounded the other day. It is a sorrowful thing to have so many brave fellows cut up, & some killed, like one of the Rockbridge Cavalry the other day, when all we ask of the North is to be left alone in the enjoyment of inherited rights. We shall surely conquer but O! how many precious lives must be lost, & how many homes made desolate before the end shall come. Adj. Hoover & I built ourselves a bark tent & stretched a piece of cotton over it & got two boards to fasten up in one corner for a table & have two stools made by driving a post into the ground & nailing on a board & two beds made by a pole to fence off a space & bark laid down & then straw filled in & I have a blanket & my cloak for a bed I got one of the jackets, made for the Cavalry -- Yesterday I was out in the woods fixing a line of pickets & got wet through & through, the black of the jacket coloring my shirt & myself too. I came back after the rain & never washed off as much  in my life -- it made me almost  through the night --   Tuesday morning -- I have no time to write this morning -- was up by 3 A.M. & the mail soon goes -- I will write again in a day or so. I should like to be at home very much & hope I may soon be there.   Love to all -- kiss the children -- May you be kept safely & God bless you. ',\n",
       " 'p027_011': \"Feeling that I have been unjustly dealt with in regard to School matters at this place, and hoping you will pardon the liberty I take in thus addressing you upon the subject, I have concluded to submit a plain statement of the facts in the case, for your kind consideration. First then permit me to say that this is my third year in the work, the first two being under the A.M.A. and this, the third, under the Baptist Home Mission Society and I think I can truly say that I have labored as earnestly, and zealously, as perhaps any other teacher, and been as deeply interested in the education of the freed children, as I possibly could have been, and never to my knowledge has there been one word of fault found with me until now. And even now the Supt. of the Schools here informs me, that he has no fault whatever to find with me as a teacher. What then, may I ask, have I been guilty of, that should cause my dismissal? - before answering this question however, permit me to state the facts in the case, everything so far as I know, up to the time that Capt. McDonnell came here, was going on smoothly, when I was called upon, in connection with all the rest of the teachers, to state what I knew about Lieut. Cook's conduct while here, and my answers to the questions put to me, necessarily cast some reflections not only upon him, but some of the teachers, and perhaps the general conditions of the Schools - but I only answered such questions as were asked me, volunteering nothing, and leaving out much that I might have said. Soon after the Capt. left here, I receieved a letter from the [unclear: rooms] at New York saying that Mr. Brackett had informed them, that I could be spared from the Valley and assigning me to Goldsboro N.C. and saying that my transportation would be forwarded in a few days. To this I immediately replied requesting them to withhold my transportation a few days. In the meantime I had a conversation with Mr. Brackett (the Supt.) in which he informed me of his action, but said he had found no fault with me as a teacher, and the only reason he had given for my removal was that some of the teachers had united against me on account of my evidence. I then wrote to N.Y. again stating to them that I was twelve hundred miles from home, and was boarding with my Sister here, and I thought it very hard to be sent away for no other offense than simply telling the truth, which to answer my question, is the only crime of which I have been accused. To this letter I received a response in substance saying that they had been informed by Mr. Brackett that I was not needed here nor in the Valley. Notwithstanding this, one new teacher has been brought here since, and one school now stands adjourned for the want of a teacher. I was, as you will readily see, forced either to go to Goldsboro, or give up my school. And in deciding which to do, I took it into consideration that I was the only teacher here that was here last year, and that I had a Sister here with whom I was boarding, and not one of the others had any family connections here whatever. And as I had been guilty of nothing for which to be transfered, painful as it was to me, I could not make it appear to be my duty to go. And now in conclusion, I desire to know if you in your official capacity, cannot employ me as a teacher, under the Auspices of the Bureau. If this is impossible, will the Bureau furnish me with a building in which to teach, provided I do it gratuitously? I had a very large school of 95 Pupils, and to which I had become very much attached. Now if you can do me the favor to arrange matters so that I can stay with it, you will place me under great obligations to you. Hoping to hear from you at an early date.\",\n",

R. was lying down, but got up and turned half around with his side to the enemy, as if to speak to some of the men who were behind. Just then he threw up his arms, gave a cry and fell backwards. He raised up his head, but could not speak, he then quickly laid his head on his arms and never spoke a word. Dull was within two feet of him and remained kneeling there for half an hour after Robt. was shot. Andrew Summers saw him after he was shot; he is at his fathers wounded. He went to school house at Liberty Hall, and is the son of the old gentleman at the Mill. The ball entered Roberts side under his left arm and passed through his heart. Poor dear fellow, I am almost heart broken at his loss. I shall never love any one like him - never! You ask me if he was engaged to Bella Tate? I know everything in regard to him and her, for he told me all. They were not engaged formally, but would have been so eventually. Do not mention anything of the kind then, but you might ask her for the likeness, as she has a good one, it shd be returned then after it is copied. He wd have her keep it always. Robert had showed me the writing on his testament and told me all about his feelings whether he should live or die, also what he wanted done if he was killed.

D S Bell to day, and he permitted me to renew it, which was a godsend indeed, for I never in all my life have been so hard up. We are all in the habit of always complaining of hard times, but without exaggeration I have never seen anything like it here. I have been particularly unfortunate in obtaining means to meet the demands upon me. I have not been able to get a Dollar from Imboden or Saml. Steele, and my hope of the fund in Kinneys hands upon which I chiefly relied, were dashed by his giving a Deed to his creditors a week since, thereby tying up this fund, and probably causing me serious loss in the end. [unclear: His] official Bond is not regarded as covering his receipts for any other year than 52 -- which does not embrace my fund. I could not induce Baldwin to conclude a settlement with him, & I employed Imboden to prepare for me a notice for Kinney during the last days of the court, which notice Brought the Deed. After pretty heavy settlements on his wife in Lieu of Dowry, he next embraces all his indebtedness as Reciever, the amount of which no one seems to know. His assets are considerable, but whether the will cover his indebtedness as Reciever I have no means of ascertaining. Imboden thinks I will lose considerably. But I am rather disposed to think that I will some day come out. This affair has caused a great deal of \"squirming\" about Staunton, & it is thought that a considerable amount of this fund will be found in hands that will find it inconvenient to fork over. Why have you not been over. I have looked for you for the last month. Your Fathers treatment of you I think is outrageous, but intirely in Keeping with all I have ever known of him. The Almighty Dollar is the power that governs all his actions. I am sorry that so serious a rupture has occurred between you, but under the circumstances it was inevitable. The most important & funniest piece of news I have to communicate is that our sister Elizabeth is going to marry Col. Bell. As winter approaches her \"Rhumatis\" increases, and she has come to the conclusion that matrimony is the only remedy for her stiff Legs & other infirmities and I have concluded that the wonders of the world will never cease. Sarah, & myself have had some hearty laughs over this affair and wish you could be here to join us. I have not heard the particulars, but have ascertained that it will certainly be during the next month.* I am sorry you did not get over to see Meg. She is looking remarkable well, and Prettier than in her younger days. her visit was not a very pleasan one to her, in consequence of the operation on her little Boy, which gave her a great-deal of anxiety & trouble.

How are you \"one and all\" getting along in the old Maidens establishment, suppose Miss Baldwin is pleasant as ever. Does she ever get Spotty on her back now? I hope not. I suppose she looked very [unclear: disconsolable ] after I left-I hav\\'nt a doubt but my departure cast a gloom over the house. Well I must stop this & tell you about the party, now Lucie Tish Annie and Mary all get round the stove with you \"little feet on it as to be comfortable and put a [unclear: book] on the arm & then set\" the lamp on it, and I will begin about the party (all ready). Well we arrived at uncle James\\'s about five and intended coming on home that night but Charlie and Annie\\'s Billie came down to the road and said we should stay all night and go to the party. Father at last consented, and we drove up and spent the night. In the first place we had harly stopped till Billie asked how his little Annie was getting along, when I went in the house, there sat two or three gentleman, you may know I was considerably frustrated but how some ever I stood the trial of being introduced to them After sitting awhile another gentleman came in. I felt very much agitated at being among so many (males). As the evening advanced, supper was announced, need I tell an elegant one aunt R never has anny other kind. And then about \"7oclock\" we started to the party. I was mounted behind Billie__\" Cousin Hannah behind Mr Dunlap one of the Brownsburg students who came home with Charlie that evening. You can fancy us riding across a cornfield with [unclear: cornstocks] higher than your head. I forgot to tell you how the rest of our party went. Charlie Mr Clemman ([unclear: Lew]) Mr Martin went in an old sleigh to break the road, we went up the steepest hill you ever saw, [unclear: sow] dreadful deep. I was afraid I would pull Billie\\'s shirt, drawers, and every thing else off before we got up the hill. But we got up at last, and arrived at the party without accidents happening. When we went in they were sitting all around the room, I was completely surprised to see so many there, when Cousin Hannah and me went in the parlor I got with Mary Smiley the first person. We had not been in but a few days minutes when they commenced playing some kind of a thing, that you seized the boys by the arms and dragged them across the rooms. The boys began to come around on our side, and asking the gals to promenade the floor wid-em. I told Mary I thought we had better take a promenade on the porch (I told Mary out there about the cat fainting) staid a few minutes went in and sad [unclear: stower], and lo! and behold! a feller asked me to take his arms. I was terribly excited and if it had not been for the support of his arm I dont know what I might have done. I tell you he was a mighty nice little fellow. There was about 28 or 30 there - just enough to enjoy themselves they were all very sociable. I tell you I never was at a party where I enjoyed myself like I did there, (we had good things to eat too) We played all kinds of kissing plays, I always got around the kissing part as quickly as possible, managed to kiss my Cousins, I now you all are tired reading this awful letter - especially this description of the party. But please bear with me a little longer. I want to tell you about little Thompson Brower, Ok! Tish he [unclear: pintedly] cut around Marty that night, you ought to have seen him jumping over the floor he cutting some kind of a step. I had a mind to ask him if it was what they call the Grecian bend I was dreadfully afraid he would slip and split himself up from the centre of gravity, you all know where that is, Annie does I know. I will tell you one more incident of the party & close on the subject as I went to get on when we started I mounted the [unclear: stile] a plank broke which occassioned considerable laughter - I tried again and the abominable old plank broke again I will have you all to comment on my misfortune; we got home [unclear: or] to uncles half past 2 in the morning. The next morning when we were ready to start (we were all in aunts\\' room) Cousin Hannah came to the door & called me out, I went out and there stood aunt killing herself laughing said one of the [unclear: oreges] women was going to have a little one, said she had just taken sick, while we were talking (babie) [unclear: hollored] recken it was hurtin / Uncle James, Father Mr Dunlap, Billie & Charlie were in the room just over her. Cousin Hanna came and called Uncle James to take them out of that room so they went out pretty quick, cousin Hannah said the nigger woman had the thing sitting on the floor, what do you think of that. I will try and stop on this subject and write something else. I want you all to decide about an offer which a gentleman sent me a few days ago. He sent me word in the first place he would give me $10.00 in Confederate monie for a composition told him [unclear: or] sent him word it would have to be greenbacks. He returned the answer he did not have the change but would give himself for one, the question is will I accept the offer I want your alls advice on the subject, of course I expect it to be confidential.

I am very sorry but I will cut a cuff out and take to your Ma next Sunday I dont think you put any thing in the note except that. I will tell your Ma how you wanted it made. I hope you wont think hard of it I could not help it.

I pursued the army about 100 miles, in four days, and at last found it here in the lowlands, flatlands, swamplands, pinelands, sandlands, enless woodlands of eastern Virginia where, as I supposed, the Gen. wants me to make a map for him, for no one can get along here without some guide. Ask any one the direction to a place and he will tell you two or three ways, any one of which is twice as far as it ought to be. We are four miles from Gen. Lee\\'s headquarters, but about 15 by the roads. I asked a man today the distance to a place, he said, \"they used to call it 10 miles, but they \"supervised\" the roads a few days ago and found it only 8 miles, so I went on and concluded that they had better \"Supervise\" the roads again. The Yankee gun boats are at Port Royal, 15 miles below Fredericksburg on the Rappahannock river, and they cannot get up any higher and they have to get across the river before they can throw a shell on this side, and if they come up higher we can pick the men off the decks with sharpshooters. - No stir to report, everything is quiet and we are ready for them every way, I should think.  I think you had better let me have one of the large hogs as you said you had no choice, on account of lard.- Have Mr. Wooster pack it down, or you see to it. - I wish you would get some oak plank, thin, and have me a box made about two feet long and 12 or 15 inches deep and wide, with a good lock - not padlock, and hinges that do not show, with holes bored in the side 1/4 if an inch to let in air, and a pair of rope handles so I can have sent me a few substantial eatings from home, and keep them when I get them. - Fix it up pretty soon. - No living here unless you provide for yourself. I provided for a few things to go in before I left home. I wish you could find me 3-gallon stone jars, straight sides.- Write to me soon. Tell Allie to send her list to me - Love to all. I hope you may all be prospered in these times of trouble. Brother, I am fearful I may not get home to stay. Remember the fence and wood hovel, please, and lots of wood. Good-bye, love to all, ',\n",

After quoting some passages from a publication in the Valley Virginian, of what purports to be the substance of a speech made by me to the people of Augusta on the 28th ult. you ask whether the report is in substance correct or whether it is approved or sanctioned by me - The speech to which you refer was altogether extemporaneous, without the aid of any note or memorandum & therefore I cannot pretend to recall the language used by me on that occasion - I presume, however, that the general outline of the speech is correctly given, but the report is too meagre & imperfect to furnish an accurate presentation of what I said - Presuming that the purpose of your letter is to ascertain what I said in relation to your own comments in regard to the movement, which was the subject of discussion, I proceed to state it as nearly as I can, in the language which I used After adverting to the opposition which has made to the movement, & the criticism which has been indulged in, in regard to the course pursued by the gentlemen connected with it, I referred to the opposite quarters from which more criticism came - I stated that while we were in Washington we found ourselves between two fires, one in front & the other in the rear, & that these fires proceeded from parties holding the most antagonistic opinions, & having the most diverse objects in view - one party desiring the adoption of the Underwood Constitution, whilst the other was unalterably opposed to it - Thus while Gov Wells and his committee were assailing our proposition in Washington, Gov Wise & others, were attacking it at home - Thus extremes seemed to meet, & the singular spectacle was presented, of Gov Wells & Gov Wise, who probably held no other opinion in common, pulling together as it were in the same team, in opposition to our scheme I also referred to the fact that the Richmond Enquirer & radical Journal, which, on all other questions, were the antipodes of each other, were yet in accord, in opposing our measure; & that George Rye, Yankee Allen, & Dr Bayne, found coadjutors even in Augusta! - After commenting on this singular union of discordant elements, & the co-operation of persons who were looking to opposite ends, I said that such alliances of men of antagonistic opinions - of carpet-baggers, & fire eaters, would be productive of no good, unless they tended to satisfy the people that our scheme was the true one - I also referred to the fact, that Gov Wise had written five letters, in opposition to the movement, but I said that I had seen but one of them, & added that I thought the history of the last eight years would prove, that Gov Wise was not a safe councillor in public affairs - This I believe to be the substance, & as far as I can recall it, the language of that part of my speech which referred to you or your opposition to the plan of the committee, with which I was connected.',\n",

It is two weeks yesterday since we heard from you I thought you might have written and the letter been miscaried but ma was getting very uneasy and I dont know what she would have done by this time had we not heard you were sick. But enough of the measles I hope you will get over them well and never take them again I reckon when Tish had them and they were expecting us to take them you never would have thought you would have had them where you are now.

I suppose you have heard of Bob McChesney's being killed whilst out scouting by an ambush of the Northern troops. His brother & Jack McBride started Tuesday for his body They are taking a metallic coffin and intend bringing him home if they can get his body. but have returned without him fighting out there Bil Runnels was one of that scout also; but they all escaped with a loss however of their Lieutenant and several horses.

Last Thursday was their muster day when the oath of allegiance was administered and taken by all except two Lacy & their Captain Johnny. He was then turned out of office and Capt Hite elected in his stead. Hutchens says he is too religious to fight he wont fight against his relations who are nearly all in the North. That if he went he wouldn't fire a ball at the Yankee's & that he didnt know whether he would take his company North or South. Dont you think he ought to have the words Traitor to his country, branded on his forehead, as heretick was branded on in ancient times.

We have also heard that Charlston is taken & that Winchester is surrounded by the Northern army. & again this morning that they have been driven back into Maryland which I hope is true. It is also reported that there has been a battle in Western Va & that our men have been driven back. Cannon reports are heard nearly every day by some person.

I left Staunton on Tuesday morning after I left home in Company with Lieut. Wilson & several other soldiers for Winchester. We had quite an interesting trip, had the company of two very nice ladies, one of them however I am sorry to say was a married lady. We arrived at Winchester on the next evening hired a four horse coach for Martinsburg where we arrived Thursday evening, from this point we had to take it a foot. On Firday morning Lt. Wilson & myself in company with Capt Wharton of the 55th Va set sail for the Army, crossing the Potomack at Williams Port, we went two miles into Maryland & stayed all night with a nice old fellow, good  [unclear: cecist]  too by the way.- Saturday morning we started on expecting to get as far as [unclear: Green] Castle Pensylvania, but we had not proceeded very far on our way before we heard that the Yankies had made a raid into the town, however we proceed on our way thinking we might be able to get through without much difficulty. We stopped on the road side to rest & were laying down napping, when all at once we were startles by the noise of some cavalry riding down the road at full speed hollorring the Yankies are coming! I tell you we got up & left there in double quick time. We fell back a short distance and made a stand but the Yankies did not come on. Thinking that \"prudence was the better part of valor\" we came back to this place, there being no chance of get through. We will remain here untill the way is open to the army before we try it again. We have had another big fight at Getty\\'sburg Penn. Our loss is very heavy indeed, lost a great many officers.- none of our commanding Genls were wounded that we have heard of. Genl Ewel was shot throu his wooden leg, also had his horse shot from under him. Our Brigade suffered severely. Our Company I am told lost a great many wounded & one killed, but cant find out any of the particulars - but one or two of the wounded from our Regt. has gotten up yet. The enemy\\'s [unclear: loss] is said to be very heavy indeed. They lost two Major Genls, several Brigadiers, & a good many Col\\'s. We captured about 13,000 prisoners & there has been a rumor here to day that Genl Lee had whipped the enemy badly on yesterday & that he had taken 40,000 prisoners this however needs confirmation. I must bring this to a close for the present. The news we get is so conflicting that it is hardly to be relied on Consequently I wont give you any more I hope by the next time I write you I can give you all the particulars.',\n",

Of course the people seen in great trepidation in Staunton and the accounts of the panic, on Friday and Saturday last, were exceedingly ludicrous & amusing -- women & children & negroes & especially the men & more especially the office-holding men - Quartermasters & Commisioners were seen running to & fro through rain & mud begging & hiring passage to some other point of safety - It is said that the Virgina Hotel was so completely deserted as to require it to be closed up - and all this panic when the enemy was at least 30 miles from them. I feel very anxious about Father & Mother &  I advised father to leave mother & may at home - but I heard they were all going to leave. I am almost sorry to advised at all - Trusting in a kind Providence to look over & take care of them I hope that it will be His pleasure to restore us all to our homes with liberty & peace & happiness smiling upon us & hearts full of gratitude for His mercy & goodness - It is a hard matter to give up home to the ruthless  of an enemy seeking our destruction and the  wisdom of God can alone see why it is done.

The result at Yorktown I trust will be in our favor - a great success there would be glorious for our cause - It would almost put a stop to the War - I feel much confidence in the result as we have noble Generals & brave troops to rely upon. I am not so well as usual - though not sick - my liver is torpid and I fear it may result in dispepsia or jaundice - I will go into the field tomorrow and will be considerably more exposed than I have been - but will take care of myself.

       " 'p043_004': 'Yours of the 24th with the enclosures has been received. I made no speech at Williamsport on the occasion referred to in the extract from the \"Age\" -- I had sent to Hagerstown and had several prominent Republicans [unclear: arrested] as [unclear: hostages] for some persons arrested by Hunter near [unclear: Hedgeville]. With them came several persons to intercede with me for the release of the arrested parties on [unclear: parol], and among those who came to intercede with me were Mr Hamilton, now senator from Maryland, Mr Romaine, and Judge [unclear: Thompson Warren].-- I had a good deal of conversation with the parties, but had no idea of making a speech, and did not suppose any one would so regard my remarks.-- If [unclear: you] heard that any publication was made in regard to what I said it has escaped my memory.-- I certainly said nothing to authorize the idea that I had ordered or sanctioned the burning of Montgomery Blair\\'s House.- It is very possible that I may have said that the burning of his house stood on a different [unclear: footing] from the plundering of his father\\'s house. But if so, it was not intended to convey the idea that I had ordered the burning, but was much intended as an excuse for the act by my men if any of them committed it.- If I had thought proper to burn the house myself, I would have had abundant justification for it in the fact that Mr. Davis\\' house in Mississippi had been burned by the Yankee troops, the Institute at Lexington had been burned, and many private houses of citizens of Virginia had been burned by Hunter, as I had seen in the line of his march. The reasons why I did not burn Blair\\'s house were 1st because, in my [unclear: then] position, I did not wish to do any act which might seem to give [unclear: authority] for any liscence on the part of my troops, and thus relax the reins of discipline; and 2nd, because it was then well known that the Blairs were opposed to some of the harsh measures [unclear: pursued] by their party, and for that reason were in very bad [unclear: odom] with the Radical portion-- In fact, it was not long before Montgomery Blair was compelled to retire from the Cabinet-- I did not think it would be true [unclear: piling] to retaliate on him, and in fact I supposed such retaliation would have gratified the extreme Radicals.-- But as he was then a member of the cabinet, I had no doubt of my right to retaliate on him if I thought [unclear: proper].-- A gentleman now living in the Valley, who followed my force, but was not in the service, came to me and asked permission to burn the house, but I refused it [unclear: puncuptarily]. The house was a new one just finished as I [unclear: understand], and I believe was not furnished at all.-- I did put a guard on it, and the fire was [unclear: discovered] and pointed out to me, as we were moving back, by one of my staff-officers who now resides at Staunton, and knows that I did not intend to burn the house. I have abundant testimony to show what were my purposes, if I thought proper to produce it; but really I do not care whether Mr. Montgomery Blair believes my statement or not-- My [unclear: card] in regard to the matter was not published to propitiate him, or to clear myself of a charge of vandalism, but simply to vindicate the truth of history-- Nor do I care care whether the present editor of the \"Mail\" thinks my [unclear: card] consistent with the statement published in the \"Age\"-- If his sympathy for the Southern cause had taken the shape of service under my command, instead of much very unfruitful sympathy as we were accustomed to meet within Maryland, he would have learned that I never shirked any responsibility for any act of mine-- I have assumed the responsibility of the burning of Chambersburg, and also of Thad. Stevens\\' iron-works-- Though I am informed Stevens always believed that Barksdale of Mississippi burned his works-- I also approved the burning of Governor Bradford\\'s house by one of my subordinates, though I did not know of it until the act was consummated-- Subsequently, if I had had an opportunity I would have done much more burning in the enemy\\'s country.-- If I had burned Blair\\'s house, I would have been entirely justified in doing so, and would have assumed the responsibility at once. I did not do it for the reasons before stated, and I have never known to this day whether the burning was done by my men or some person in the neighborhood hostile to the Blairs-- It is very possible that some of my men did it-- If so they abundant provocation in the sight of their own houses or the houses of their friends that had been consigned to the flames of the enemy in the line of their march into Maryland. If you think proper, you can show this letter to the editor of the \"Mail,\" and he can show it to Judge Blair if he thinks proper.',\n",

I should have written before but yesterday the Yanks came up towards Orange C.H. as though they thought of fighting, so we had to pack up, start the train to the rear, get the troops together and go away through the fields to find them, but our cavalry started them back before the infantry got near -- so all we got for our move was a good ducking, a tramp through the mud, had our tents to put up about dark, in the same place on wet ground &c. but we got it all done, carpeted our floor with boughs and leaves and so got along very well -- I had an attack of cholera [unclear: Morbus] yesterday morning, a chill first -- cant imagine how I brought it on unless I ate to many fried apples -- for, though blackberries are very abundant in the field where we are, and we have a plenty of them all the time, I do not think they would hurt me, but I got along yesterday & last night took a cup of tea and slept soundly and so feel very well today. We are to have a quiet Sunday, no business going on -- Gen. Lee has ordered that no business shall be transacted in any of our armies on Sunday -- a very good order. The Gen. just told the Adj.

Two prisoners were just brought in -- they are from Ohio, but claim to belong to the 1st Va.

It found me in good health and I was glad to hear from you and all was receiving the same blessing of health but I feel somewhat vexed since I read your letter to think of some things that is about reenlisting. I have not reenlisted nor do I ever intend to under the present circumstances. If I have to stay in service you can mark Jesse one that has not re-enlisted if you believe what I write unless my mind changes very much from what it is now and what it has been for some time past. Accordance with the late law that has been  for some time-between the ages of 18 and 45 will have to be in service for the war. It makes no difference whether I want to or not unless they can get a detail of some kind  any honorable detail that I can get, for I dont think that duty would be any harder than it was on me. So if you have a chance you need not be uneasy but what I will except of it  so I hope that you may meat with success in what you have undertaken and I hope that this will satisfy you about re-enlisting and it may give you comfort and happiness to you, it dont do for a person to believe all they heare now a days. Furloughing is still a going on. There is to ahead of mine yet so I am still in hopes of getting one before long, we can have the pleasure of talking in place of writing it. it would give me so much more comforty. I have not heard anything about giving up in Virginia. It may be so, but I dont believe that they are going to do it, for I think if they give up Virginia this crewell war will be over soon. I dint know what will be best for to do if John leaves. If you can [get] some one to crop it would be less trouble to you and if I should be so lucky as to get off-I would rather do it myself, so i leave that with you to decide. I judge there is no chance of hiring any one to work with any certainty. As they take what little you do raise - it wont pay you for to pay a big price for hiring. How old is John and how long can he stay before he would have to go in service? Does he want to go? There is some boys that goes in service sooner than they nead, but I don't know how it is with him. If you have a chance and can if you would move some of your corn out of the crib someplace else. They would not bother you so much. It is right in the way. it shows too plain.

       " 'p017_029': \"I have been thus particular about our present location for two reasons, first to enable Pa to tell you precisely where I am, at the forks of the road running off to the Bridge 14 miles from Lexington & 10 from Buckannon, & secondly to test my own identity & self possession and equilibrium, which I have very nearly lost, so rapidly have events chased each other & so wearying has been the last ten or fifteen days. In all my experience of war I have never been so chased, pursed, dogged. I have given you some little information up to Brattons, near Panther Gap on the Va. Central RR. Well, from there they chased us through Buffalo Gap where we barely made good our escape from Hunter who had beaten Jones the day before, notwithstanding we had prevented the junction of Crooks and Averill, with him. From the Gap we had a dead race to get to Middlebrook (but here I remember that I wrote you from Middlebrook) before Crooks who turned across the Mountains near Goshen Depot to strike the Valley at Middlebrook, & catch us between himself & Hunter, but in this he failed & passed on to Staunton, leaving us at Brownsburg (did I write you from this place?). Nothing daunted we turned our backward march into a forward one, shewed our Ragamuffins on the Hills in one mile of Staunton, driving in the pickets of the enemy, then falling back about six miles for the night. This so enraged them that early next morning Crooks and Averill 12,000 strong marched out against us, swearing that they would drive McCausland to Hell, & really from the way he has put us through from there to this place seems like he would be able to keep his word. On the morning of the 10th, at about 9 o'clock, he attacked us 6 miles from Staunton, & for three hours the 22nd and 14th held him in front, the 16th and 17th guarding the flanks, but what availed courage against such odds, 1400 against 12 to 1300. We commenced falling back, calling into the main road all our little army, they pressing us heavily in the rear and flanking us by two parallel lines, running each side of the road we were on. We were in what may be called a very tight place. If we turned our backs 'twas a ruinous rout; if we moved back fighting, slowly, the flanking columns, one, two thousand, & their other fifteen hundred strong (cavalry) would pass & engulf us. Here was a dilemma. Of the two horns, we chose to seek the latter, keeping one little squadron well mounted, sternly & slowly getting in the road, & from one company to a regiment, as the pressure required, on foot, each side of the road, thus retreating & fighting the entire day, for thirty miles. Nearly all the balance of the command except horse leaders were engaged in scouting and skirmishing on the flanks. During the day we repelled 5 charges & made two, to keep them from closing upon our rear. Night brought us to Lexington one mile beyond which we halted, still keeping between that place & the foe, where foot sore, hungry & exhausted were determined to rest. After seeing that the men had rations for the night, at about 11 o'clock P. M. I threw myself upon the ground, exhausted, gloomy & sad. This had been the hardest day of my experience. I had been acting as aid throughout the day beside discharging my own duties, in getting off stores from Brownsburg which I had accumulated there, & just as I had commenced one sweet dream of thee & of home, the Genl. called for me to go with him to Lexington to the Institute, to consult with Genl. Ship, comdg. the cadet corps (250), and Genl. Smith, who had just reached the place from Richmond & tendered the services of these brave Boys. Here a long consultation ensued, through which I was only enabled to sit by frequent potations of strong (don't look cross) Coffee, handed round by Genl. Smith's fair Daughter (& oh such a pretty foot, too!). Back we went to camp and after a brief repose was roused to life by the thunder of Crooks guns close upon us. We retired across the river & made the best disposition for checking (we knew we could not whip) them we could. About 10 A.M. the battle commenced. We had three pieces, small ones, & for 4 hours we had quite a brisk time. Finding our little forces flanked beyond our reach, we fell back to this place yesterday evening, and on this Sabbath day we rested; that is the troops did. I have been engaged in hunting up and impressing supplies. Maj. Smith CS has joined with wagon trains but this morning the Genl. asked me to hold on as Bridg. CS for a few days, & like a goose I done so, for the sake of seeing the men fed, though nothing else could induce me. I should like to write you a long letter but have no paper but will hunt up some scraps & give you some few incidents of the various fights, more particularly that of Lexington, in which you came very near being reduced several times to the necessity of hunting up another husband. Pa knows the river cliffs beyond the Institue, between which & the Institute Hill runs a deep ravine. On these cliffs were posted our sharp shooters & one piece. Here I must close for the present, the Genl. calls me. Just in the rear is Institute and other hills rising higher than the Bluffs. About 11 o'clock the enemy commenced a severe fire from some six or eight pieces, the shells screaming, shrieking, bursting & whizzing all over the crest of the hills above mentioned. (Pa can tell you that on the opposite side of the river the country is even higher than our position & gave them the advantage). On Institue Hill was generally found the Genl. & staff. & it was here that you had like to have been a widow. The corps of cadets were thrown up here, & here were seen (?) the officers, & here fell the shot the thickest. Sitting on my horse in a little wheat field, sorta (?) on the southern slopes of the hill, Capt. Harvie, Mr. Marshall & two others by myside, a riffle shell passed so near as to nearly take my hat off. I had only time to observe to Capt. H. that we should have to move, as they had gotten the range, when another came shrieking through the air, passing just before Jeff's head, and plunged into the ground, some fifteen feet past me, seemingly, burying itself two or three feet ere it exploded; when it did so throwing a large quantity of earth upon everything, making a grave nearly large enough to bury horse & man. Poor Jeff, he was completely  paralized  with fright. He had been very restive all day but this was too much & he only trembled & perspired in a foam. He shook so terribly that I could hardly keep my seat, and for three hours after he was in a perfect quiver. I have never seen anything so frightened. I fear he is a coward, but he, poor fellow, need not be ashamed for his betters, or rather his masters, considered it prudent to canter to another part of the Hill, only to await a repetition of the same, sitting upon the platform in front of the Lexington Hotel, where some of us had dismounted to breathe our weary steeds. The rascals on the other side of the River (Pa may remember looking east, or north of east, the hills beyond can be seen) got the range of the street completely, & seeing a group of horses & men, let fly a shell among us & so fine was the practice (?) that it passed over our heads about 5 feet, passing up the street about 100 yards beyond us, striking the bannister of a porch, rolled harmlessly into the street, striking the porch of course. Thus was your husband twice saved from destruction, once by the depth the shell had buried itself in the earth, and again by a bad fuse, the latter shell not bursting. Well, here we are, & Crooks & Averill in and around Lexington with between 20 and 25,000 men. Hunter is or was at Midway, and by sunrise tomorrow we must again confront them, but to fall back: but wewill fall back like Spartans of old, & fight them back into the City of Richmond. Here I shall have to stop again. I am three miles from Camp: have just eat supper. 'Tis ten o'clock. I must go to camp. Can't say when I shall finish this. It occurs to me to finish now, or rather close, for tomorrow brings sterner things. I remember you are a Soldier's Wife, hence I shall talk plain. It has always been my habit to talk plainly to those I love. Therefore do not let what I am going to say disturb or make you sad. I always try to keep my lamp trimmed as well as possible, temporarily at least. Here, the Pay Dept. owes me from first of August 63; the QM Dept. forage for two horses, about 5 months, at Gov. prices for grain and hay, commencing first of Dec. 63 and ending with this year. Capt. N. Fitzhugh owes me 500$ - have his note. Capt. W.D. Haynes, Officer, 200$ (note). Capt. C.I. Harvie, Adj. some 60 or 80 odd dollars, & my vouchers for the month of May, will more than cover the amt of funds recd. from government on account of Brgd. expenses.

       " 'p043_012': 'Your inquiry as to what I recall concerning Father\\'s association with McCausland in the burning of Chambersburg on July 31st [1864] is quite an order. Mr. Freeman gives somewhat more than average space to the notorious Chambersburg raid and its aftermath and consequences (Lee\\'s Lts., Vol 111, pages 571-574). In order that you may contrast what Freeman says with what General McCausland himself said on the subject, sixty years after the event, I am sending you under separate cover, to be returned to me when you are through with it, copy of the September 1940 issue of American Legion Magazine which carries an interview General McCausland gave Mr. Garnett Laidlaw Eskew in the summer of 1925, nearly two years before the General\\'s death (on January 27, 1927) at the age of 89 years. I enclose herewith, for like and to my mind more authentic comparison with the American Legion article and with Mr. Freeman\\'s account, a typed reproduction of the following communications from Father to Mother, all written in pencil, much of it on horseback, and some of it scarcely decipherable, recounting the incidents immediately preceding, coincident with and following the Chambersburg raid: 1. Memo bearing the date line \"Two miles below Bunker Hill, 5 o\\'clock A.M., July 25, \\'64\", from which you will note that he was aware of the fact that something momentous was in the planning, just what he obviously did not know. 2. Letter bearing the date line \"HdQrs. 5th Cav. Brigd., Haynesville, near Williamsport, July 28, 1864\", which indicates that he had by that time been apprised of what was in the offing and of its dangers. 3. \"Notes on the Battlefield and in the Saddle for Hattie\", commencing with July 29th and ending with August 8th, 1864. 4. Letter bearing the date line, \"HdQrs. McCausland\\'s Brigd., Mt. Jackson, Va., Aug. 9th, 1864\", enclosing and supplementing the foregoing \"Notes\", which might have been before Mr. Freeman when writing his report and estimates of Chambersburg and its dramatis personae.  Father\\'s line command had been, of course, the ith Va. Cavalry, but at Chambersburg he was A.C.S. (Acting Commissioner of Supplies?) of McCausland\\'s Brigade, seemingly outranking General Bradley\\'s C.S. on this expedition into Pennsylvania for the same reason that Brigadier General McCausland (27 years old) outranked Brigadier General Bradley Johnson, vis. because General Early had placed McCausland in overall command of the Confederate Forces. The September 1910 Confederate Veterans article on Aunt Mollie Tynes \"Ride\" gives the following biographical data on Father: \"8th Virginia Cavalry. Served as Lieutenant one year, then as Regiment, Brigade and Division Commissary. Served on staffs of Colonel Corns, Brigadier Generals Jenkins and McCausland and Major Generals Lomax and Rosser.\" I enclose a typed copy of Father\\'s parole, on the face of which you will note he is described as \"Capt. A.C.S. 8th Va. Cav.\", while Father\\'s longhand notation on the back refers to the fact that at Appomattox he was \"A.C.S. of C.S.A., General Rosser\\'s Cavalry Division\". According to his notation, \"This division, or part of it, broke the Federal Lines on the day of the surrender\" (Lee\\'s Lts., Vol. 111, p. 737) and \"with McCausland\\'s Brigade I came to Lynchburg, thence home to Tazewell Co., Va.\". Brownstown (now Marmet), mentioned in this notation of Father\\'s, is on the south or east side of the Kanawha River, about 18 miles above Charleston. As you know, following his parole, Father took the boat to Cincinnati where he purchased and transported by boat up the Ohio Tto Catlettesburg, then up the Big Sandy, as far as push boats could go, and then over the Sandy Ridge to Rocky Dell, Tazewell County, by pack horses, the first carding machines ever to be installed west of Lynchburg. Until I unearthed Father\\'s parole, some fifteen years or so ago, Colonel George S. Wallace and other historians in this part of the country seemed to have assumed that General McCausland \"never surrendered\" but had, on the day before Lee surrendered at Appomatox, fled to Mexico where during the next two years he enjoyed intimacy with Maximillian, for whose wife he named his only daughter, Charlotte. General John Hunt Oley, (New York State) USA, Provost Marshal for the Department of West Virginia, mentioned in this notation of Father\\'s, remained in West Virginia following the war, coming to Huntington the year of its founding in 1871, where he became and remained, up until his death in 1888, the City\\'s \"first citizen\" -- capitalist, educator, churchman, having founded and for fifteen years being the Senior Warden of Trinity Episcopal Church. Now as to the date of Father\\'s visit to General McCausland. I came to Huntington in September 1910 and I know that Father immediately began writing me about paying me and General McCausland a visit \"next summer\". About April 1, 1911, I went to the new Kentucky river Region coal fields, in consequence of a three months contract with Kountze Brothers coal interests which was extended over thirty years, and did not get back to Huntington again for about six months. I am pretty sure it was during this six months period in 1911 that Father paid the visit to General McCausland. I remember Mother saying to me afterwards that she would love to have looked in on Father and the General during the second evening of their reminiscing, by which time she was sure they must have been at each other\\'s throats. The General\\'s daughter, Miss Charlotte, is still living at the old home place up the Kanawha River some twenty miles from Point Pleasant. Either two of his sons, whose tempers are quite up to that of their Father and who were quite as embittered as he, have been tried for murder during past years, or else one has been tried twice, with one conviction, for which he has long since been paroled. I planned several times to visit Miss Charlotte, but never did so, in view of the circumstances just mentioned. I purpose yet doing so. Reminded of the circumstance by Freeman\\'s reference to Colonel William E. Petters\\' brief imprisonment by General McCausland for refusing to carry out his (really Early\\'s) orderto burn Chambersburg (Lee\\'s Lts., Vol. 111, p. 572), I recall the following colloquy which ensued between Colonel Peters and me at the close of my first Latin lecture in September, 1901: Col. P: I see from my class roster that you are from Tazewell, Sir. Did you ever know Captain C. A. Fudge, and is he still living? BCT: Yes, Sir. Col. P: Will you be seeing him again soon? I have not seen him since the summer of \\'64. BCT: Yes, Sir, I hope to see him if and when I get home for Christmas. He is my uncle -- my Mother\\'s only brother. Col. P: (Embracing me, with moist eyes). Captain Fudge and I had some heated differences at Chambersburg (or so I seem now to recall it) which we mutually agreed to settle on a personal basis rather than under the rules of war, with the consequence that we parted company with the tacit understanding that he with the quickest trigger and truest aim would tell the story of our next encounter. Hearing, while passing through Charlottesville, the Captain Fudge was in our old infirmary here, suffering from a gangrenous shoulder wound, I called to pay him my respects and to extend to him my apologies, but finding him under the influence of an anesthetic I was unable to see him. Our paths never again crossed. When you see him I want you to convey to him assurances of my high esteem and affectionate regards and to say to him that he was right and I wrong and that I trust he has forgiven me. I immediately wrote Mother the substance of this colluquy. Beyond telling me that uncle Charlie had been greatly touched by Colonel Peters\\' message, I do not recall that either Mother or uncle Charlie ever added to Colonel Peters\\' narrative. According to Freeman, at Chambersburg, Colonel Peters was Commander of the 21st Virginia Cavalry which doubtless was a part of either McCausland\\'s or Johnson\\'s Cavalry Brigade. Why uncle Charlie, who was then Captain of Company H, 45th Virginia Infantry, should have been at Chambersburg, has never been clear to me since according to cousin Newt Harman\\'s Annals of Tazewell County, Vol. Two, page 454, uncle Charlie \"was desperately wounded and was captured by the enemy and remained in prison until the close of the war\", in the Battle of Piedmont, which Freeman says was fought on June 5, 1864. Cousin Newt, of course was in error about his \"remaining in prison until the close of the war\", the fact being that he was not taken prisoner at all in that battle, but after being wounded was taken across the Blue Ridge to the Confederate Hospital in Charlottesville, later the University of Virginia Infirmary, Left, as you know with a limp shoulder and arm, he never again saw service. A further circumstance that throw cold water on my recollection of my above quoted colloquy with Colonel Peters is the fact that uncle Charlie condemned and deplored the burning of Chambersburg just as much as did Colonel Peters and Father, so that that incident would not have been a matter upon which uncle Charlie and Colonel Peters differed to the point of being ready to shoot one another at sight. It is inescapable, therefore, that the incident to which Col. Peters referred was in nowise connected with the burning of Chambersburg, as I have for so long thought, but took place prior thereto, indeed, prior to the Battle of Piedmont on June 5, 1864. Can you help me out on this, or the subject, or if not can you tell me who can? I have thought of writing Don Peters on the subject, but do not know whether he is still living, and doubt if he could shed any light on the subject if he is. I know Don slightly, when I returned to the University for my law in 1908-10. Trusting that you will find what you want in the foregoing hastily prepared narrative,',\n",

I have written to our mutual friend Mr. Kennedy who consents to go, and I have also written to Mr. Granger who will go if he can arrange his business so as to leave it, but of this he expresses considerable doubt. I think a party of three or four would be most pleasant. Will you consent to make one of it? I can assure you that I should be greatly gratified to have you, and I know Mr. Kennedy would. Our intention is to go down through the Southern Atlantic States, to Mobile and thence back to Savannah where we will take a steamer for Havanna, and possibly visit some other of the West India Islands, and thence to N. Orleans, and up the Mississippi through Tennessee and Ky. to Cincinnati and thence home. This route, however, may be shortened, lengthened, or varied to suit circumstances. We would rendezvous at Baltimore, about the 1st of March, and might hope to accomplish it all in from one to two months. Will you not go? Can you spend the same length of time more pleasantly or even more profitably in any other way? It seems to me not, so let us calculate on the pleasure of your society. This Nebraska matter presents a new phase to things in Washington. But is it wise for the South to set the example separating the compromise of 1820? If one compromise be disregarded will not another be, and will not the South in the end be left to the tender mercy of Northern fanaticism with an overwhelming numerical majority? These are Serious questions for the South and yes it may be difficult for her to resist the proffered favor of Douglas' Bill. She may suspect the motive; she may see its fatal consequences and its delusive benefits, but can she resist it? I think the measure will pass the senate by a decided majority, but its fate is doubtful in the house, and there is reason to apprehend that it will reopen the slavery agitation, much with all its bitterness, if not all its dangers to our Union. We had fondly hoped that this question was at rest, for a time at least, but I fear we are to be disappointed.

       " 'p042_045': \"If you are the dearest and sweetest little woman in the world don't you think I am the most patient and kind hearted old gentleman of all your acquaintance? Think of it, this is the fourth letter, at long intervals, since I have had a reply to one of mine. Just three weeks ago to day I parted from you, and that night wrote you from Keysville, and that is the only letter to which I have recd. a reply. Couldn't you have sent me a little note from Laurenceville? I wont scold. I never scold, but if you could know with what avidity I read every word you write me, and how anxiously I look forward always to hear from you, I am sure you would admire my pa-tience and my philosophy. My darling is all the world to me now. I love my children as dearly as any father ever did, and they are as lovable, but there is in the human heart a capacity to love that is not gratified by mere paternal affection. A large part of my life has been one of the deepest and tenderest love for woman. I know how glorious it is to be master of a woman's whole heart, and to feel that she is mistress of mine. Long years of the purest pleasure in that holiest of all earthly relations husband of a true and noble woman, has taught me that outside of it, there is little worth living for. When I first met you I was almost indifferent to the world. I did not know that it any longer contained any one whom I could love again, as I had loved in the past. Ere I had known you three days, I saw that I had found a woman at whose feet I could lay my whole heart, and then my anxiety was to know how I could win yours. You know how earnestly I labored the to accomplish that result. Providence favored my suit & you gave me your young & noble heart. Ever since I have felt how blest I am. I feel the pain of separation every day, I am sure more keenly than you, because the wreck of my happiness that has occured more than once in the past, has prepared me by a bitter experience, to appreciate the infinite pleasure of the Constant presence of pleasure of loving one's heart's idol. But as a certain period of separation is inevitable, I long to alleviate its pain as much as possible by frequent communication with you. And had you a daily mail I would write to you every night. Therefore you must pardon me for complaining a little at your long silence. When you are at home again, please, as you value my happiness, never let a mail leave without bringing to me a letter from you - a long sweet letter - or if that may not be, even a little note will be prized. When you are my dear little wife I may spoil you, if petting can do it, for I feel that the debt of gratitude I owe you for making me so happy can never be paid off by all the endearments I can bestow on you. This week I will probably know when I may expect to return to Virga. I expect Col Flournoy tomorrow. Indeed he may now be here, as I wrote urging him to come on yesterday, or as soon afterwards as possible. I suppose our company affairs will require me to spend some weeks of the winter in your County & Brunswick. If so where would you advise me to make my head quarters? especially to spend my Saturdays and Sundays? Do you know any pleasant place in Mecklenburg where I would sometimes be a welcome guest? I will be guided mainly by your advice. I have not a line from sister Lou sisnce her first short & hasty note and not a word from Sis Ella - will quarrel with them.\",\n",
       " 'p006_035': 'Your very very welcome letter came to hand on the evening of the day before yesterday and deserves my heartiest thanks. I was rejoiced at your punctuality and am endeavoring to imitate your example by writing at the earliest possible hour. I received your letter too late on Monday evening to permit of my answering it that day and yesterday I started to Harper\\'s Ferry about six O\\'clock and returned about eight or nine last night. So you see it has been really impossible for me to write sooner. The length of your letter was if possible even more gratifying and though I may not be able, when I am encumbered by military duties, to attempt any successful emulation in that respect, yet I must exhort you in the language of the bible (now don\\'t look so astonished. I read it sometimes) \"not to grow weary in well-doing.\" I have always since my earliest remembrance had an especial admiration for long letters and when I have time am rather fond of writing them. I have at last succeeded in getting Ma\\'s consent to my joining the army and my name is down on the roll of a rifle company which will organise to- morrow and will probably be in camp by the first of next week. I am beginning to feel \"as savage as a meat [unclear: axe]\" and am afraid before I am in the army long, if I am not shot I will get to eating Yankee stake for breakfast. I must confes I do not think your reasoning on the subject of my going to war, entirely logical. I think now that Virginia is invaded it is becoming that every true Virginian should shoulder his rifle and march to the rescue. I should have enlisted sooner but disliked to go without the consent of my Parents and now that they have very reluctantly consented I am preparing to hurry on as fast as possible. I had the pleasure of casting the first vote of my life last Thursday and was happy to give it in so good a cause as that of ratifying the ordinance of Secession. Our county gave 902 majority in favour of the Ordinance. We have several abolitionists here round us but I can\\'t get any one to help me hang them. I wish I could. Is Chum dead, or has he enlisted in the army? I have only received one short note from him since I came home and if he is not dead he had better be before I see him again. I spent about four or five hours at Harper\\'s Ferry yesterday. It is almost impossible to find any one you want to see. I tried to find the Augusta Rifles Capt. Grinman, but could not. I had to enquire of about fifty persons before I could even find out where the Cadets were stationed. You need not have the slightest apprehension of my being disappointed in your letters; if they are any thing like the one which I am making a desperate attempt to answer, I would consider myself an ugly fellow with dreadfully poor taste if I did not appreciate them. You ask me what I think of Carlisle. I think about as well of him as of Scott; he is worse than Seward because a Virginian and a thousand times worse than Lincoln because poor fellow he don\\'t know any better. Nature has not been unusually bountiful to him with regard to brains. By the way the Republicans attempted another of their base strategems in Alexandria. I heard from my cousin a day or two since, who was in the army there he said that on the morning the city was taken the ships which brought the troops down sent a boat on shore with a flag of truce and gave them until nine O\\'clock to evacuate the city promising not to enter the place until that time then as soon as the messenger returned they commenced landing and attempted to surprise our troops and take them prisoners. But fortunately they were on the alert and all of them escaped except one Fairfax company. Such another cowardly and direct breach of faith is not recorded in the history of civilised nations. I feel unusually dull this morning, but it is useless to tell you that for you must have long since discovered from this disconnected & tiresome letter that I am either either unusually or usually boring. Tell Miss Ella I was looking at her \"ambrotype\" last Sunday in church, my cousin admired it very much, indeed I am afraid he will fall in love with it which would certainly be quite unfortunate as she is engaged. (I hope her sister is not). I will also your question also. I do very often think of her sister. I have treasured  the cockade for though it will not be needed to make me think of you, yet in future years when I am forgotten it will minister consolation by reminding me of the time when once you agreed to accept my friendship and promised sometimes to think of me. But you know the greatest of Poets has said \"Woman thy vows are traced in sand.\" Although my letter is not quite so long as yours I must close, as I have to make preparations for leaving. By the time you write again I shall probably be in camp in Leesburg so please direct to that place, And write me another long letter very soon. I hope you will.

Lt. [unclear: Tubbs], assist Supt says that in Botetourt County our forces \"have been withdrawn and the feelings are so bitter that it is impossible to do anything to assist the Freedmen without the presence of the military. It would be worse than useless to organize schools without protection, and there should be a school at Fincastle, the  [unclear: town]. This county is over seventy (70) miles from Rail [unclear: communication] by way of Lexington, while it is only fourteen (14) miles from Bradford Station on the Lynchburg RRoad.\" I therefore repeat the suggestion that it might be better controlled from the Seventh than the Sixth District. In Alleghany County the freedmen \"are busily engaged trying to earn and furnish living\" and have no difficulties with the citizens although there are no troops there. And this fact is properly accounted for by the [unclear: fine] freedmen, the demand for their labor, and the absence of large plantation habits and interests among the Whites, who are generally small farmers. Through the rest of this Sub District \"a large percentage of the freedmen are contracting for the next years labor, but money is so scarce that the employers make their own contracts which are quite liberal to the freedmen.\" \"I know of no paupers or vagrants in this Sub District.\" \"During the past Christmas they have behaved so nobly that they have won praises from their bitterest enemies.\" Every effort to organize a Board of Agents has failed, and Lt. Tubbs thus has to adjudicate all cases, and he says \"there are but few crimes committed by the freedmen.\" In Augusta County there is no [unclear: noticed] change. There was very nearly a riot in Staunton on Christmas day through the free use of liquors, and the fact was unmistakenly evidenced that the freedmen need protection from bad men who were but lately \"masters\" and \"[unclear: Whites],\" and who would now override any civil laws not in accordance with their notions of a White mans privilege. In Highland Co. I have but just been able to get a foothold, and temporarily stationed Capt. Wells, again at Harrisonburg who [unclear: operated] with good effort upon the peculiarly rebellious spirits there, who had succeeded in frightening away Mr McLean, a teacher of the freedchildren. I have arranged for his successor who would be maintained there so long as there is any force at my disposal. In Shenandoah Co. everything is working as well as could be expected. In Warren County I have no agent for want of troops to sustain him. An attempt has been made to establish a school at Luray, but the teacher has already asked for military support which I shall be unable to find him. In Frederick and Clarke Counties the condition of the freedmen is as each reported, good. In Jefferson and Buckley counties they are generally well off and fairly treated. Taken as a whole, the freedmen in this District are in comfortable circumstances, and conducting themselves in a highly creditable manner. Yet there are many cases of suffering among the very poor and helpless, and especially needed for their relief is fuel. I have been able to supply clothing and food to quite a large number, but the want of wood -- with the thermometer below [unclear: 0 zero] -- has been seriously felt, and great suffering has been and will be the result of our inability to afford the desired relief.',\n",

Mag and Hannah are at a sewing today at Mr Thomas Harris helping the girls to make their cloaks I was invited too but was not able to go I did not expect to go if I had been well. I have just finished reading a statement of the treatment of Col. L. M. Lewis when a prisoner in the north and it is the most outrageous things I ever read I wish you could see it. I commenced this letter Thursday and found I could not send it to the office and it is now Saturday.

But it is no use believing any reports now. We are all well here at home, but in great trouble. Every person between the age of 18 & 45 have been drafted and now I am alone with a house full of children. All your friends about here will start for Staunton on Saturday morning next. What their destination is when they get here, is unknown, some say Strasburg and others say out West, to support our troops near Beverly - the last report is that the Enemy has fallen back on Beverly. We are very near the Enemy now. Joseph I. Ruff goes as captain of the Militia from here. I am sorry to hear of your sickness and hope if you are not able to join your Co. soon, that you will get a furlough & come and see me. It is impossible to tell you the distress of mind I am in. It is hoped they will send the Militia back as soon as the states quota is obtained. There is not much news stirring all is preparation for war. Many of our people are unable to get up their grain oats & hay so sudden in the draft. If the powers that be had put it off in these hills for 2 weeks our people would have been better prepared to leave and would have left in better spirits, but as it we must bear it but the Urgency of the measure possibly would not admit of it.

Two or three weeks  ago, we determined to write to the  Governor (before we would get  coats) to know whether he would order  us out or not. After waiting two  weeks, Mr. Jas Davidson of this place  came home from Richmond, bringing  us word that the Governor would not  call us out under any circumstances.[1]  Saturday night Capt. Nelson received  an official answer from S. Rafael French,  Aid de Camp to the Governor requiring him  to ascertain the consent of the parents  of the boys and to report to the Governor,  and he would then \"decide the matter.\"  By the same mail  Prof. White received  a letter from Greenlee Davidson (son of the  above and clerk in the Executive department)  telling him to ascertain the consent of the  parents of the boys, and that the Governor \"would  order us to Harpers Ferry or the Manasas  Junction\"[2]. A good many of the boys  had gone home. They have been written  to, to return. The parents of a few of the  boys will keep them at home, but we  have been getting some recruits to fill  their places. There is no doubt but that  the company will be filled out, in a day  or two. We are drilling four times a  day. Recitations suspended.  The captain ordered us to get flannel  shirts or jackets. We have no coat.  We are out of money and would  like to have some this week if you can  send it. The County Court appropriated  $25,000 to equip volunteers, allowing $25  per man. An effort will be made to  have ou the remainder of our uniform knapsacks paid &c -paid for out of this  fund. Some of the court object to it,  because we do not all belong to the  county. We have heard a great many  reports about the fighting at Hampton Harpers Ferry illeg., but they are too  favorable to our side to be believed.  I heard this evening that 7 houses in the  upper end of Waynesborough were burning  yesterday as the cars came by, couldn\\'t  hear whether it was by accident or had been  set on fire[3]. In consequence of so many boys  leaving, the Faculty has called a meeting  of the Trustees, next Saturday, to graduate  the Senior Class and suspend College.  Whether the company goes or not it is  not probable we will have any more  College duties this session.[4]  We will write again as  soon as we hear from the Governor.  I would like to have two new pair  of woolen stockings.  William & I both want a new  strong cotton shirt. We have one  apiece, our sleeping shirts which  have never been used. You need  not send them here, as we will  go to Staunton and most likely  by Waynesboro of which we will  give you notice. Has Ma gotten home? and has she improved? Write to us soon. ',\n",

I occupy most all my spare time with our daughters - Jennie & Russie. They are enjoying themselves immensely. Two or three nights of the week I take them to some theatre. The other evenings are spent in returning visits. They have had quite as many calls as they can conveniently return, and several invitations to [unclear: dismiss]. With their quiet Virginia notions and manners, they felt a little nervous at the prospect of force & ceremony of N.Y. dinner parties, but the experiences of a couple of weeks has worn it all off, & they say now \"they aint a bit afraid of Yanks.\" Really they are meeting with so much kindness from my friends here, that they think it would be delightful to live in N. York. Today they saw say more fine jewelry & rich plate than they had ever dreamed existed. Mr Tiffany the millionaire jeweler of N.Y. is an acquaintance of mine. He called on the girls night before last, and was so kind as to come around this morning and take them through his establishment. Amongst hundreds of things he showed them was one diamond set, price fifty thousand dollars gold. A solitaire diamond $10,000. A pearl necklace $12,000. A sapphire $4500. An emerald $5500. As Mr. Tiffany is a bachelor of 50 years of age, I have urged Russie to \"set her cap,\" so that you and I may have a rich son-in-law here to visit. How much I wish you were now my dear little wifey, and along with us here - it would add so much to my happiness, & I am sure you would will enjoy with a keen relish the pleasure of all the novelties & sights of the great metropolis. However these girls will get so well \"posted up\" that next spring when they accompany you on your bridal trip they can turn the tables, and matronize Mama, instead of being matronized by the old lady! As is usually the case. I look with great interest for a letter giving an account of your triumphs at the Concert & the wedding. I expect to hear that ever so many young fellows have fallen victims to your fascinations, and are pleading most eloquently with you to give up \"that old widower\" and cleave unto them. But you won\\'t do any such thing, will you? Did you deliver my message to the bride, that you were soon to follow her good example? I dont know why sister Lou dont write again. And it is time I had a letter from that other pretty sister at Tallahassee, unless she is mad that you are taking the start of her. Well you know I tried to explain to her that if she had only been at home last summer, she would have been the one, but that in her absence I fell an easy victim to the other fair charmer, and it is now too late to mend the matter. I hope she is reconciled to it and will forgive my precipitancy & write to me. By the way turn over your claims on that young Cotton Broker to her. May be he will feel that \"one of the name is as good as the same,\" and may thus escape dying of a broken heart. Bless your dear heart what would I not give tonight to sit by you a half hour and get half a dozen of those sweet maidenly kisses, on the memory of which I have lived now nearly three weeks. I do wish I had your picture to look at and kiss, but how is a picture to be obtained away off in Mecklenburg? Impossible I know. I hope it will not be long before I see you. I expect Col Flournoy here on Monday. Hope we will soon return to Virginia, and that I will spend some weeks in Mecklenburg & Brunswick Combining business & love making during some of the Cold dreary time intervening before my happiness is crowned.

I felt exceedingly anxious about you when I wrote to you in September I was by no means sure that my letter would ever reach you. consequently I laboured under many fears & doubts as to whether I should ever hear from you again or not & to be deprived of a correspondence with so dear a friend as I claim you to be would be truly hard to bear with. Ah! my dear Kate I am sure you can form no idea how much I missed the pleasures of your dear sweet letters during our long silence. I was truly deprived of a pleasure beyond the comprehension of many but now that our correspondence has commenced again I feel perfectly delightful I hope that nothing may happen to prevent a regular correspondence as long as we continue to be such devoted friends. I am satisfied that marriage on my part will never make me forget my dear sweet sister Kate as for my dear little friend Lou she is well aware that you & I are devoted friends & correspondents & I know her well enough to be perfectly satisfied that one of her kind & gentle nature will, or does highly appreciate your true & unselfish friendship for sure, but as for marrying, indeed my friend that is something that I certainly dont expect to do soon my present situation will not admit of any thing of the sort. were I to get married now I dont think that I would be doing any lady justice in consequece of my embarrassed situation in life. I am fully determined never to marry any one until I feel capable of placeing the object of my affections in a paralel condition to her present one or better it if possible. Therefore I fear it will be a long long time before I can realize any thing of the kind. Well enough on that subject I am truly glad to hear that your dear brother & friend Willis are safe at home after the great fall of our poor old Confederacy. it is truly a great blessing that they were spared to return to their homes & loved ones. I assure you that I have really enoyed peace & quietude since the close of the war not withstanding that it did not end in accordance with my desire & at first I was truly thunderstruck, but when I considered that the grief of one could not possibly do any good I concluded I would try to enjoy peace & the sweets of home once more & try to thank God that it was no worse & that a few of us were spared to tell the tale. You see from the steading of my letter that I have left old westmoreland for a season & am at this time staying at this place where I expect to be for several weeks. will try to keep you posted as to when I shall remove from here so that your letters may always be properly directed so they may reach me safely. you must write to me as often as you can your letters are such a great comfort & satisfaction to me. You must remember me kindly to your Pa & Ma & sisters & all enquiring friends if there be any, but of course I dont expect there are any from the fact that I have no acquaintances in that section of the County.

She is a perfect [unclear: termagnent] among the darkies & when the equality of her temper has been a little ruffled, her voice reminds me very much of a thrashing machine in full motion, or the escape of steam from a steam whistle. I suppose I\\'m too hard on the old woman, but she will forgive me I reckon for the sake of a little [unclear: four]. Well how is l_e_d getting along I suppose she quit coming to see the sick after I left, she is the biggest fool I ever saw I think & I dont know why somebody d\\'nt tell her so. I have\\'nt heard a word from my Dearie since I saw her a month ago, I would like very much to hear from her & much better would I like to see her, though it is hard telling when that will be. I wish you were here Rate, we would go to see the falls & the mountain lake, two great natural curiosities. The falls are about 5 mls from here. I have never been there, I know but little about it. The mountain lake is 8 mls from here on top of a lofty mountain. The top of the mountain is level for some 6 mls across at this place, with some interesting ravines. This lake has been formed in one of these in the last half century. Some years ago several small streams from the mountain sides around led down into the bottom of this deep hollow & formed an outlet through the ground, cattle were salted here it is said in Summer a great[unclear: -eat] & in the course of time the opening at the bottom became closed & it began to fill up, & it was 30 years filling up to where it formed an outlet From a little pool where cattle were salted it grew to be a pond, & from a pond it has grown to be a beautiful silvery lake three mls in circumferance & three hundred feet deep. You can\\'t imagine any thing more beautiful & grand than this lake on the mountain top. There has been a beautiful hotel erected on its margin by a Mr. Porter & not another house within six miles of it. There are several boats there for the accomodations of visitors, but all old & out of repair & a sail on the lake in one of them is not half so pleasant as it would be in a a good skiff or sailboat. I stopped there a little while as I came from [unclear: mission] here & sailed out upon the lake in comp\\'y with Mr. Long, when we had gotten about a half mile from shore, there came up a tremendous storm of wind & rain & you may well suppose that we hauled in canvass, tacked about, & bent our oars into port, we reached shore without any accident except a good soaking. The water is quite clear & pure & one can see down in to it for some distance.  There is a high knob of the mountain 3/4 of a mile from the lake, from the top of which you can see into Kentucky, Tennessee & North Carolina. When the war is over I am going to get married and bring my old woman here to see it & you may come along. Give my love to all & Cousin Sallie too & write soon. Direct to Newport Giles Co.

       " 'p023_049': 'Yours of the 8th was received on Sat the 10th I am sorry that you put so sharp a construction as your reply seems to indicate, upon my letter. I did not intend to \"criticize\" you in the matter of Mr C\\'n\\'s removal, and certainly now, with your explanation, if not before, if I were to say any thing about it, I would see the propriety of it for I most certainly have the highest respect for the judgment of the  of the A. M. A.  word had been said about the expense of our schools here until a very few days before Mr C\\'s removal, when I received a letter from you containing a threat to discontinue them if not carried on cheaper, and then Mr C removal coming at the same time and all together without the slightest premonition, or expectation you will readily see that it startled me a little; and that letter was the result of that fright and written at that time, but was not sent, finally until the end of the month, And I was sensible when I came to read it over that It was objectionable in some parts as it seemed ambiguous and liable to an unhappy interpretation. Mr Coan was so  and so useful in counsel that I felt very sad at losing him; and the facts that I named as reasons for retaining him were by no means intended as \"criticisms\" but only statements of things as they are seen by one on the ground\" (I mean in regard to the probable increase of attendance at the various schools) calling for more teachers and making work for a Supt in organizing new schools Now I can not tel what facts you are in possession of and what you are not, but the missionaries on the ground, must be the eyes of the \"Association,\" I suppose, not to decide grave questions in regard to the business of the society but to furnish facts which form in a great measure the basis of your action, and  I attempt to do that I do not intend it for criticism of the doings of the Secretaries. In regard to the remarks of the Sec concerning the schools of the Valley I think as you say that I misapprehended somewhat his remark But was it not natural for me to feel a little jealous of that school for which I am working day and night I don\\'t mean to be proud of it but considering the Sec remark to include it and attributing a part of his criticism to my School I felt that it was certainly a mistake of which justice to these teachers, and credit to your work here demand the correcting. And the fact that in some of your past letters you ask us to write cheerful ones led me also in connection with the remark of the Sec. to feel that you seem to be partly incredulous in regard to success We do hope that you will not look on the dark side so much And when we attempt to make you believe that by the blessing of God we do succeed we do not mean by that to be \"Lecturing any Sec on the manner in which he performs his duty\" And now in regard to the Expense\" of  Staunton  And if there is any thing in the world that we ought to do that we are not doing we should be more than glad to do it. Did you notice my statement in the other letter That the little expense for wood, lights etc. were paid by the pupils now--and also that there would probably be but few more books wanted at present, also the 225 per year--heretofore paid for rent for school house is now discontinued--and I will add that the rent on the Mission House is $60 less per year from Feb 1 than formerly--that is 60 is allowed by government for use of a little  office  house, since the first of March when the time ran out but the price will not be different under the old bargain it is presumed. There is one more way of reducing expense perhaps which involves questions which I have nothing to do with but would obey any orders or follow any suggestions. We might perhaps go into colored families to board. The ladies I think are willing Tho it would be hard for them as these low cotages are warm tho\\' some are quite neat Mrs D perhaps might  And if we went into colored families whether you could in justice discharge Miss T who now acts as Matron - and wheather, as the rent ran but the first of March we should be any way obligated for rent after that time, or at least after the time of going into colored families--and wheather it would be well for the cause--are questions which you can if you see fit consider Mr T has been very kind to us and I do not want to do any thing on my own responsibility that would cause hard feelings either for your sake of his ',\n",

I hope there will be no other expense here for next month aside from the salaries--as I think the school will pay the board of Miss Burke and myself until warm weather comes. The past week has been a holyday with nearly all the school--which is the reason why Miss Davison has had to pay her own board one week.

I have been hoping that Nelson might be able to get away and come down here, but the road is so bad that it would be to the great discomfort of any one that should attempt to come. I did not get to eat any of the nice victuals you prepared for me, for the General sent me ahead when we left Mt. Solon and I was not at my wagon again until we got to Winchester and so everything had spoiled, much to my regret, but while fighting & marching are going on we do not often see our wagons until quite late at night, I wish I had the things now, but I am doing very well as I am among my friends here and have been invited out several times, I hope I may get home soon but I cannot well ask to go for several are away that have not been off before. If we go to Mt. Crawford I will send from there what I have for you, unless I got a chance from here; I shall not send until I am sure it will go safely, I would like some provisions from home, some substantials, crackers and butter, but little of anything else, and I may be able to send for that. We are being heavily reinforced and I suppose will soon be on the march again after the enemy. God blesses our arms, our men all fight like heroes, and success has heretofore attended all our efforts -- We whipped Fremont on the 8th, and part of our army slept nearer to Harrisonburg that night than he did, we inflicted a great deal of damage on him, drove his regiments with great slaughter from the field and then came on the next day, and unmolested crossed the river and whipped Shields completely, captured all his artillery and pursued him 10 miles capturing several hundred of his men and scattering his whole army to the four winds, while Fremont drew up on the opposite side of the river and witnessed Shields defeat, only throwing over a few shot and shell after the whole affair had ended and we were sending our ambulances to bring Shields\\' own dead & wounded from the field, and Fremont was near enough to see what we were doing, and he actually threw shell at the building in which the wounded of both armies lay, with a hospital flag flying from it -- the brute. Shield\\'s men fought well for their officers made them believe that we would kill every man that we captured -- They said many of them would give themselves up if they knew we would treat them kindly. Many of them regretted that Ashby was killed -- for he was killed on Friday -- in a skirmish after a sort of battle in which he had displayed great valor -- he is a great loss to us, we miss him every day, but hope that Providence may raise up some men to supply his place -- and be the right hand of Jackson. The men of Fremont are Dutch -- of the very worst sort, they have plundered the country wherever they have been, they stripped the houses at Cross Keys completely, taking all the drapes of the ladies, breaking up the dishes &c &c They wrapped up their dead in the blankets, carpets, quilts &c that they had taken from the houses -- they were very brutal to the women in language, and stole everything they could get hold of. they came up \"spoiling for a fight and a good many of them spoiled after the fight\" as Gen. Ewell says. I will write more about the battles, or tell you more when I see you. We had sacrament today in camp, it was a solemn scene, and Dr. Dabney prefaced it by some excellent remarks --.

       " 'p020_017': 'I hear of a reliable opportunity of sending a Letter if I can convey it to Staunton by Monday morning and a gentleman alike interested with myself has concluded to go in tomorrow and take the Letters. This is a disagreeable day indeed - has been hailing and raining all day. Did you ever know much more severe winter weather than we have had since 1st November? It has been very cold here and I trust will soon improve, for mild weather to a soldier is truly desireable. We are now very quiet in camp as there are not many of the men present - mostly sent off on detachments where they can feed and enjoy the comforts of home and do duty also. As to their several localities, prudence would not allow me to designate. We are still in the old camp at Swope\\'s Depot - can feed here several weeks yet. I have often wished I had you at a private house convenient to camp where you and the dear little ones could feel contented and satisfied. But it is the greatest difficulty to get such favors of strangers. Charity seems to have played out now, and all are for taking care of no. 1. I think people should feel for those who are deprived of seeing their families and put themselves to some little trouble to accommodate under such circumstances. But the people all seem to be against the army, for the reason that they think the army of government is against them, because of taking surplus Forager etc. from them. Well, let this feeling continue much longer and we are a gone up Confederacy as certain as the sun shines. \"A house divided itself cannot stand.\" The cause of the Confederacy is to me now darker the ever heretofore, but as McCawber says \"I hope something will soon turn up,\" calculated to encourage us and tend to discourage our enemies. I can see no prospect but to make war a business of life, for subjugation of our large armies will only tend to fill every part of our country with Bands of Guerrillas engaged in most desperate and uncivilized warfare. No man can feel safe on confiscated property and such a reign of terror will exist here as was the case in Kansas a few years since. I hope the senses of the people will come to them soon and that laying aside leading men who are fighting for military fame the people will have the matter referred to them and peace follow as a result therefrom. But I suppose that the Great Ruler of Events will bring this war to a close in His own time and way. Let us try and exercise patience and trust that all will yet be well. Rachel, Mrs. Phillips will come out about 1st February and I am directed by Mr. P. to say that you must take my clothes to her and she will bring them to Staunton and he will immediately notify me where they are. Says he will leave them at a safe place. He also says you must take them to her pretty soon and she may come in a few days after you get this. Their Battery is disbanded and she will spend the time here with her Husband at a relative\\'s. Maybe you can make arrangements to return with her, but I suppose she will not remain long enough for that. If I knew positively whether Mrs. H. was coming out I could tell you what to do. Capt. H. will know soon if she is coming and if she is coming out I can tell you what arrangements to make in case I conclude not to come to Mrs. B\\'s. Let me know what Mr. B. says on the subject and also Mr. L.\\'s opinion on the subject. Hess started this morning to go home. He will have to be careful I think. Will Amanda go with you if you come out? If you think best to leave all the children at home, do so. I would love to see them and if I conclude even to visit Mr. B\\'s would it be prudent for them to come and see me? Would it be advisable for me to come home one night or go to Mr. B.\\'s and send you word? Be cautious in your Letter in answer to this in case it should miscarry. I just had a talk with Capt. H. He writes. He writes by the same opportunity for Mrs. H., if she has not yet started and can make suitable arrangements, to come out with Mrs. P. Now if you can find out from Mrs. P. whether Mrs. H. is coming out at all in the next 5 or 6 weeks, and you can make arrangements to accompany Mrs. P. I can join you at Staunton and go on to R. and return with you by the time Mrs. P. wishes to go home. You see Mrs. P. comes in her own conveyance and will stay about Staunton some 4 weeks which would enable you to get home again. Now if after consultation with Mrs. P. you and Amanda can arrange so that she will take you back again, it will be a good arrangement and I would advise you to do so with out any regard to my coming to Mr. B.\\'s. Now recollect provided that Mrs. H. is not coming out. This you must know positively for if she comes out I cannot leave camp for a month as Capt. H. has put in for a Furlough of 30 days expecting her out from Letters last received. They were written, though, early in Dec. and he does not know whether she is coming or not. It would be well enough to know from Mrs. P. if she has friends along the route and at Staunton you could stay with until I came in and went with you to R. Mr. P. will accompany her out - you can find out all from her. If you should come you can hear of someone in Staunton belonging to the Brigade who will send one a note - if not telegraph me of your arrival there to Swope\\'s Depot or else telegraph me from Harrisonburg to meet you in S. I shall put in for a Furlough in a few days. By the way, I expect to go to Richmond next week to return in 5 days, on business for the Reg\\'t. An application for papers to pass me went up to Gen\\'s Early today. If approved by him I shall go about Friday or Saturday next. I wish you were here to go with me. I have [heard] nothing from Capt. H. being transferred from here. I am disposed to think his papers will be disapproved and he remain as Q.M. of the Reg\\'t. He felt very certain of his change when I wrote you on the subject - indeed everyone thought so, but military life is very uncertain in all its branches. How are all the dear little children? Oh, how I should love to be with my family once more in quiet and without fear of Yankees. When I think of our nice happy home, surrounded as I was by an affectionate wife and cheerful happy children, another contrast with my situation in these dreary woods, my heart almost breaks. But these trials are, I feel, for some good and wise purpose and I try to bear up under these all as cheerfully as my nature will admit. If you do not come with Mrs. P. and you can be assured of the safety send the clothes - and I will probably put them on and come down to Mrs. B.\\'s early in Feb\\'y. Will close now and write a few more lines in the morning. If the children are not entirely well don\\'t think of leaving home. If Mrs. H. does not come soon and as soon as my furlough comes, if I hear you are not coming with Mrs. P., I think it very likely I will try and meet you at Mr. B.\\'s. I prefer to do that in case I could find feed for a horse at Mr. B.\\'s. Let one know what I must do in your next. So many people going home have really almost made me conclude to risk it.',\n",

You can tell him so. I am as ever one of his friends. I want to know if either you or Baxter ever engage in any plays that you have to stoop to let the girls put their arms round you.

The amount of suffering among the Freedmen is comparitively small. But in cases where there is Extreme privation and are paupers, the Overseers of the Poor invariably deny such admittance to the Poor House on my application thereby setting a defiance the order of the War Department requiring each County to support its own poor. The County Court has issued an order requiring all of its Officers to assist the Bureau in Serving processes, and which if carried out will be of incalculable benefit to the Bureau. Highland County Transportation has been so limited that I have been unable to visit this County, consequently cannot say much about it.

So I put on her little hood, & red cloak and she kissed me \"bye\". She will be three years old the 14th inst. She grows rapidly, & becomes daily more interesting as her mind develops. She is a world of comfort to her Pa & me. I received a letter from Ma last week, and she says sister Emma, (Mrs. Geo. P. Holman) has a beautiful little daughter! How I would like to see Emma and her bridling! She has an excellent husband, and a lovely home Our family were all well, and still delighted with the climate, soil, scenery, &c, of Oregon, and especially with the celebrated Willameth Valley, where they live. I am very anxious for brighter skies natural, financial, and political. Are not you? By the way, is \"Mayor Ellyson\" your husband\\'s father?

She stopped at the Exchange. About a month ago she went to Salem, Roanoke Co. to visit a school-mate, and while there, here uncle William was appointed a delegate to the Valley Rail Road meeting in Baltimore, & wrote to her to meet him in Charlottesville, & he would take her on with him. She did so, and they spent one week in Baltimore. There she heard Carlotta Patti sing, and Ritter the great Pianist, played. She was quite carried away with the concert From Balt imore they went to Washington, where they spent two days, visiting all the public buildings. Georgetown, Arlington, & Mt. Vernon. Went by water to Richmond. Nannie was so sorry she did not know your address, for she was anxious to see you. She enjoyed her trip mightily, and declares she has been half around the world! She came home last Saturday eve,g, and we certainly were glad to see her. She is well, and sends a great deal of love. Do you ever see Maggie Eidson, alias, Mrs. Pete Wilson?

       " 'p010_039': 'So far from adding anything to my despondency, your letter was a source of gratification & satisfaction - Your sentiments harmonize more nearly with mine, than those of any one else, & I read your statement of occurrences & remarks upon them, with a consciousness that I am reading truths, & not monstrous exaggerations- The utter disregard for truth, which permits both sides in every contest great or small, to claim a magnificent victory; & for justice, which aggravates every slight iregularity on either side, into a monstrous outrage & crime, illustrates forcibly the degrading tendency of the war - an approach to truth may be attained from the public prints only by a careful study of details in the accounts of both sides, & deducing conclusions - upon general statements nothing can be founded Upon general principles I am led to believe Richmond must fall. Time is all a besieging force of appropriate numbers needs, & that time has been given in a great measure. McClellan\\'s reconnaisances have been sufficiently complete for more than a week or ten days, to admit of definite plans & arguments, doubtless now in course of prosecution. Except the battle of Seven Pines, we have read of no engagement near Richmond, & I am satisfied the Yankees have not been idle. I am forced to conclude also that the \"Seven Pines\" is wholly without other than moral effect. The Yankees were doubtless somewhat worsted, but its effect bears such a proportion to the fate of Richmond, as a skirmish among [unclear: picquets ] to an impending battle between opposing contiguous armies. I am also so perfectly satisfied that the Confederate generals have already done, & are still doing everything that can be done in the premises, as to make that fact an important consideration in my conclusions. If they could have done so, they would certainly have before this joined battle in full force, & thus have adopted perhaps the only means of saving the city. Whilst I am writng this may have already been done, but we heard nothing of it. I know you have mourned with me over the losses of our regiment at Lewisburg. My first information was that poor Thompson was killed and Col Patton\\'s brother were killed, and that Rand was left lying in the field with a broken arm. These things shocked me greatly, & I have been greatly relieved to learn that my information was not correct. We have though to mourn some good men, Lieu t  Tom Mason formely \"orderly\" of Barker\\'s Co was killed- he was a very worthy man. [unclear: Capt ] Chase & Lieu t  Johns (formerly 1 st  Lieu t  & orderly) of Lipscombe\\'s Co were also killed, Except one of the privates Chenning) of the Riflemen these are all of the fatal casualties I have learned Thompson\\'s other eye was badly shot, & being badly stunned by the Shock, he was left for dead upon the battle field - Rand was not wounded but taken prisoner in Mason Matthews house - I am glad of it - he will now at least be out of danger & can see his friends. - The regiment is said to have behaved handsomely, they had the post of honor (the right flank), & drove the enemy before them as far down as Mason Matthews house; the  repulse & flight of the left made it necessary for them to retreat but they were so far in advance, as to make their escape with great difficulty, & not without severe loss as the Yankees had nearly closed in behind them. I get this information from Cap t  Ruby who has recently written me. You havemay have heard it long since - I have a warm affection for  the regiment, & whilst I rejoice over their gallantry I deeply mourn their losses I can tell you little or nothing  of news here, On Sunday  cannonading was heard here. On yesterday morning (Monday) I heard with great distinctness heavy cannonading, very frequent & somewhat continued - We learn the fight on Sunday was Ewell\\'s force with part of Jackson\\'s old command, engaged with Fremont & Rosecrans\\' forces between Port Republic & Harrisonburg. On yesterday Jackson fought Shield\\'s near Port Republic - Shields came up the Valley from Front Royal on the East side of the South Fork of Shenandoah, & the battle took place on that side - Jackson attacking. To tell the results of these two engagements is a different matter. I hear that the Confederates were victorious in both, - the following are some of the accounts. The rumour before the fight on Sunday morning was that Jackson & staff had been captured at their headquarters (this was false of course) - Sunday evening \"Enemy badly whipped took 18 cannon\" \"Enemy [unclear: do] took three cannon\"-Monday morning\" Ewell whipped Fremont \"Enemy [unclear: do]\" took every thing Shields had\" (Shields army at that time not engaged) - Monday morning \"Ewell whipped & whipped & routed Fremont\"- &c &c &c Monday evening \"Jackson routed Shields, Shields retreating & blocking the road behind him\" - Last evening late it was reported Fremont was crossing the North river at a ford between Port Republic \"The Valley Turnpike, & it is certain that the bridge across the river at Port Republic was burned by --- Jackson --- the Confederates - A victory followed by the retreat falling back of the victorious army, & the destruction of the only bridge left in the Valley, is certainly not a remarkable success. The bridge you will see by reference to a recent , across Middle river just before its junction with the South fork of Shenandoah river. Ewell fought somewhere along the road from Port Republic to Harrisonburg, & must have fallen back for he would scarcely have burned the bridge behind him. An additional fact is that sick & wounded &c are being removed from Staunton by order of Jackson - it is also said that Jackson received a regiment or two reinforements on yesterday, & more are expected to-day. These are reports which have reached me distilled through many brains & lips. You can study them for yourself I can draw no conclusions I have abandoned all hope of receiving any letters from my wife & sister. My efforts to get them aided as I have been by kind friends have been [unclear: unavailing]. My family have not heard from me either. The Federal officer at Charleston burned my last letter which reached them in February Col Patton thought the last which I wrote improper & did not feel authorized to send it - on neither side therefore have we received letters for many months.

That in Highland County the general feeling towards Freedmen is unfriendly but they avoid all controversy and are gradually migrating to adjacent counties wherever they find opportunity to better their condition. In Augusta Co. employment is readily procured at fair wages, $8 to $12 per month for men, with rations, which taking into account the cheaper price of Corn Meal & Bacon is equal to higher rates paid in Eastern Va.

Mess. Mann [unclear: &br] refer to Gov. F. H. Pierpont & others for Wood Choppers $15 per month is offered and such labor is in demand. The condition of the Aged, Sick & very young both White and Colored is however distressing and I regret to find myself without Food or Clothing to relieve the many deserving applicants, especially of those living in Staunton. Mr. Bunch, Overseer of the Poor has inadequate means at his command it is true but he lacks any sympathy whatever and I have been compelled rather sharply to insist upon relief for old and sick colored women. Referring to my predecessor's Report under date April 1st 1867 I would most respectfully call your attention to the need for providing some Medical attendance for the very poor in this place. At Staunton is the focus for seven (7) important Turnpike roads, hence there is always a floating population who have here neither home or friend, and if sickness overtakes them are helpless. Dr. S. C. Harris of this town has to my knowledge since my arrival here, and as I learn previously, not only given his professional services, but medicine without pay. His own circumstances are very straitened and though he freely donates the past he cannot go further unassisted. I therefore on behalf of many sufferers, some sick of typhoid fever, ask an appropriation of Twenty five ($25) per month for Dr. S. C. Harris if he will continue to prescribe and furnish medicine for destitute colored person at Staunton. If a small amount of Food can be issued it will alleviate much distress.\",\n",

Hoge the Quarter master at Monterey if you desire it & direct him to do so although the corn is invoiced to Monterey to send it through without unloading to Greenbrier River. Col. Scott who is now in my office says he does not think 20 loads of corn can be stored at Greenbrier River. Please advise Capt. Hoge what you wish done by express. Yesterday a train of wagons loaded with corn was started from the county of Rockingham to Monterey. It is most important the bags should be returned to us & for that reason if there is not room to store the corn at the River I wish it stopped at Monterey. I hope you will not think me troublesome in writing to you about these details, but there has been so much mismanagement I think it is best to communicate with you direct until I get all in good order. There are now 1000 men in the Hospital here and it is too much crowded. Surgeon Boatwright informs me he has 250 men on the road to this place. I have recommended to the Surgeon General to authorize me to contract for the use of the Rockbridge Baths 9 miles from the Central Rail Road & will accommodate 300,and also to contract for Stribling Springs provided we need them & I feel confident we will need both in less than 10 days.\",\n",

       " 'p007_018': 'About a week ago I stuck a bowie knife about an inch into my leg; the muscles have been so sore ever since as to render me unfit for duty. Yesterday I was sick all day, and you may judge of the feelings of pleasure and gratitude with which I received and perused your long, kind letter which came to hand about an hour ago. I am now sitting flat on the ground under the shade of a large oak to the rear of our camp with a sentinel pacing backwards & forwards in front of me; and the paper resting on a box lid in my lap, trying in some degree to requite your kindness or at least by displaying proper feelings of gratitude to encourage you, that you may \"not grow weary in well doing\". There what a sentence! Please don\\'t criticise my letters amidst the bustle and confusion of a camp it is impossible to compose, composedly & indeed it is very difficult for me to write at all. I received a letter from Chum last night which I answered very hastily writing him six pages of this size. I also wrote a six page letter this morning to a friend of mine in Washington who I hear wants to get over to join us. I directed him if he thought there was danger of his letter being opened to answer me in cipher. I can read any cipher I have ever yet seen without the key if it is divided into words. But notwithstanding that I have written so much as to be already tired I will try and write you as long a letter as you will have the patience to read. We are now stationed two miles from Leesburg, with no straw in our tents or even in our bed ticks and have to use bricks for pillows, and I have had to sleep one night with a pair of wet boots on. I had of course quite a sore throat the next morning but am over it now. I have been quite unwell yesterday and to-day, but if there should be any prospect for a fight I will be well in ten minutes. Some of our men have gone over to Maryland this morning to reconnoitre. If I had been well enough to march I could have gone along. I will be well enough in a few days any way. We are only a mile or two from the river and can hear the Federal drums beat every morning. I hope we will soon be still nearer. I was just starting to town a few days ago when news came that the enemy were crossing, we were ordered to our arms, sick and well, and received twenty rounds of cartridges but the dispatch was false and we were all disappointed. I expect your brother has met the enemy before this, I wish I was up there. I am so much afraid we will be kept here idly in our camp while others do the fighting. I would give all that I possess for the pleasure of marching into Washington at the point of a bayonette. I have just heard of one of my classmates, a Virginian by birth who is now in Lincoln\\'s army. If I see him once a ball from my musket or revolver will settle it if I am not killed first. Nothing would do me so much good as to take the life of such a traitor to his State. I have been very anxious to get down to the river ever since I heard that the Washington Volunteers were stationed near us. I want to meet them more than the misguided fanatics who have been taught from infancy to hate the very name of a Southerner. We have an artillerist here who has been all through their camp and gotten off safely every time. He says he can whip any six men in Lincoln\\'s army.  Well I will bore you no more with military subjects, as I can find others more interesting to myself. When I was told that you were a flirt I thought none the less of you for I have long since found out that the world seldom judges correctly, and learned to form opinions always for myself. When I form a favourable opinion of any one, what I hear to their detriment, \"passes by me as the idle wind which I respect not\". I am sometimes rather impulsive and form opinions and attachments without taking the time or pains to examine the reasons for them, yet in the end the opinions seldom prove untrue or the attachments of short duration. Excuse one more political allusion. You asked if I thought the South should take Washington. In my humble opinion the Confederate Army should march into Maryland as soon as possible as long as we act only on the defensive we cannot compel them to grant us a peace. If Maryland sympathises with us she would wish us to march in and relieve her of the Northern robbers, she cannot be neutral now and if she sympathises with the North and belongs to the United States, that power has made war on us and we have a right to invade any portion of her teritory. If we should attack Washington in all human probability they would destroy the public property there and leave one thing less in the way of a settlement. We must whip them before they will do us justice. It makes not the slightest difference whether you tell Chum of our Correspondence or not; he is a friend whom I would trust to any extent and I beleive is a firm friend of yours. I do wish he was over here in our company. The persons who told me you were a flirt had no idea I am sure of slan- dering you, but of course I could not mention their names, as they did not give me the privalege. But that is your reputation all through Augusta. The reason of my thinking the ladies changeable and deceptive is not that I have been flirted with or even trifled with but I have been so deceived in ladies characters by judging them from their parlor manners and besides I have been intimately acquainted with so many and known how often they changed their minds, that now I am perfectly convinced that inconstancy is the general rule; while candor and constancy are rare exceptions. Yet I am thankful that there are such glorious exceptions. I had almost forgotten to apologize for writing to you on Sunday, but here we have no Sunday or day of rest except when it rains, all days are alike here. We have no preaching and the men are suffered to go to Church only half a dozen at a time. But to return to the former subject, I have never yet been in love. I am afraid to bestow my affections on any lady for fear she may not be willing to requite them with an undivided heart. I might give you a description of the lady I admire most, but fear to do so. Besides I have tried your patience sufficiently already and must bid you adieu for a week. I do wish I could see you once more, it is so much better than having to write. Hoping that you will continue to answer as punctually as formerly.',\n",

If I thought it would make you really jealous, I would send you a copy, for I like to see a jealous woman sometimes. But as a copy would be very long I will give you the substance.

I had to tell her what each one said, about each little poem (three in all) and as they said a great many pretty things - and I wished to say some pretty things too it made a long letter. Then I had to tell her where I meant to have them published. Then the news & gossip of N.Y. took up a page or two and then I told her that I had made up my mind to get married soon and wanted to know what she thought of it, with her peculiar notions on that old institution matrimony. I told her if she had been a marrying woman, as she ought to have been when I first knew her, she would have caught me before I ever saw my other sweet heart who is now to be my wife - but the gig is all up now - it is too late. How often will you kiss me when we meet for telling you all this? When Miss Parke's Poems come out I will send you a copy. They are mighty pretty.

Series of 1864 from Head Quarters Asst Comr Dist. of Virginia, viz:  First Division Frederick County  1st The general condition of the freedpeople is much improved since last report. With the spring came employment for all who were able to work, and except in cases of sickness or old age, the colored people have acquired a certain degree of independence which if properly directed will have a moral force which even their enemies must respect. The \"lazy drunken Niggers\" so often heard of have disappeared and the \"white gentlemen\" have more than filled up the vacuum. On occasion of decorating the graves of the confederate dead in Winchester on the 6th June a scene of drunkeness and riot presented itself throughout the day which more than equaled the puny efforts (compared therewith) of the whole colored population of the County for the last twelve months. She sure went down on that day, remarkable only for swearing, fighting, drinking shouting and horse-racing and had the colored people indulged in a like manner, on a similar occasion, on the Union dead, the County Jail could not contain their numbers. I am sorry to report that outrages on the colored people have been of more frequent occurrence within the past quarter, than formerly and that Justice is discriminating in favor of the white man and I regret to state that in such cases, when appeal is taken to the Military Commissioner, they do not receive the attention which they seem to demand. Except in cases of sickness or extreme old age, but very little suffering exists. The County Authorities have shown every disposition to care for both cases, and also for such others as had a legitimate claim for public aid. Very few contracts for labor have been made at this office, as the freedmen have grown distrustful of the intentions of employers to honestly abide by and faithfully perform their duty in such cases. The experience of the two past years has convinced them that at the expiration of long contracts they almost invariably find themselves in debt to the employer, or if a balance be due them, they have to resort to litigation to obtain it, and the expense of legal proceedings would generally more than counterbalance the sums due. 2nd The hope of impartial justice to colored people in cases where they are interested against whites is remote. She who was supposed to be blind has so far recovered the use of one eye, as to see and punish the offences of the freedmen, which are always brought within the range of her vision, while with the imperfect sight of the other, she blindly winks at the white man. Not only is this the case in Jury trials, but even Magistrates will stretch the law to convict a colored or acquit a white man. 3d The Marriage Register for the division is believed to be complete. No additions are made to it, and all persons contemplating marriage are now referred to the County Clerks for a license. Par 2d No opportunity is lost to instruct the freedpeople as to their duties and responsibilities under act of Feby 27th 1866. Par 3rdThe Civil Authorities take no action to abate lewdness and adultery, and although every effort is made by us, both through the churches and otherwise, bastardy is alarmingly common. Par 4th Only one surname is used by the Freedpeople. 4th The County and corporation provide adequate means for the care of their indigent citizens. and the treatment of the races is believed to be impartial. Many Freedpeople, however, from a general superstition will not avail themselves of the privileges of the poorhouse. 5th The supply of labor is equal to the demand. During July and the continuance of harvest many more could find employment, but only for a short period. As there is a consant floating population to meet all demands, no encouragement can be given for the importation from other sections, of any considerable number of laborers. 6th The schools, which have been well attended during the past three months have closed, with one exception. Notwithstanding opposing influences attendant on sectarian quarrels, there has been a more marked degree of improvement in all the schools, than in any former session. The Methodists have opened their church and a Summer school will be continued therein. The people of the Bethel Church are erecting a building to be used jointly as a church & Schoolhouse. It will be ready by fall. The Baptists also have some funds on hand for the purpose of building a church and Schoolhouse, so that by another year Winchester will be amply provided with the necessary buildings to accomodate all who may desire or be induced to attend school. A school at Newtown was organized during the quarter and sustained without expense to the Bureau. By having the rent paid by the Bureau another year, sufficient inducements may be offered to procure the service of a more competent teacher at the above place. Second Division comprising the Counties of Clarke, Warren & Page. 1st In this division no perceptible change in the general condition of the freedpeople is apparent. Although all are employed no cases of suffering are reported, yet as no considerable number of freedpeople are congregated at any one place, it is difficult to estimate the general condition. At the principal places, namely Berryville, Clarke Co, Front Royal in Warren County and Luray in Page County, there is evidence that the freedpeople as a class are not far behind many of their white neighbors. The schools in this division have been as well attended as could be expected, and the people generally are believed to be industrious, temperate and prosperous. 2d The likelihood of full justice being given to freedpeople in cases against whites is very questionable. Frequently on colored people applying for redress of grievances to Magistrates their complaints are met with excuses, and only on application of the officer of the Bureau have such complaints been attended to. If official restraints were removed I do not think full justice would be given to freedpeople. 3d The Marriage Register is supposed to be complete for each County of this Division. Par 2d Capt Ripley, the officer in charge has performed his duty so far as practicable, in acquainting the people with their responsibilities under act 27th Feby 1868 Par. 3d No notice is taken by the Civil Authorities of lewdness or adultery and bastardy is not publicly looked upon as [unclear: Criminal]. Par. 4 Only one surname is used by colored people. 4th Each County provides for its own poor, of both colors. The means as regards buildings, are poor and the feelings of the freedpeople are so strongly opposed to the poorhouse, that it would be difficult to induce even the most destitute to enter them. 5t The supply of labor is not at present equal to the demand. Many more could find employment at perhaps $10 to $12 per month with the usual allowances farming hands alone are wanting. 6th The schools having closed with the exception of one at Berryville, I can only observe that the qualifications of the teachers were not of a character to reasonably expect much from Schools in their charge. Mrs. Jackson, col. at Berryville is however an exception wither the two months of her administration a perceptible improvement is observed. The demand for schools in other places than where held last winter, are not urgent, and if organized it is doubtful if a sufficient number of pupils would attend to warrant the experiment of employing a teacher and other expenses. Third Division comprising the Counties of Shenandoah & Rockingham. 1st All the Freedpeople are employed and as in the 2d Division they are well distributed, except at Harrisonburg, and their general condition is prosperous. At the latter place there is a good schoolhouse, the property of the colored people well attended, and showing a degree of efficiency commendable to Miss Phoebe Libby the teacher. This school also closes on the 1st July, much to the regret of parents, and pupils. Reports of unprovoked assaults on Freedpeople and known Union people are well founded, and the recent outrage perpetrated at Woodstock before reported is perhaps the best indication of popular opinion which can be cited. While the freedpeople are industrious peaceable and temperate, showing every disposition to become good law abiding citizens, they are not always permitted to enjoy the fruits of their industry quietly, but are cruelly maltreated by vagabonds, publicly known in their locality as \"White gentlemen. The frequent absence of Mr. Hall from his division and his reticence in affairs taking place during such absences no doubt stimulates offenders to repetition of such unlawful practices. A second outrage was perpetrated on the colored girl Celina Jackson during my recent visit on inspection to Woodstock. While the girl was walking quietly into Church on the Sabbath she was assaulted and struck across the face with an umbrella by Robert [unclear: Law] one of the party who on a former occasion was fined \"one cent\" by a Jury for whipping Mr George Rye, present State Treasurer. If practicable I would respectfully recommend that the officer of the Bureau at Woodstock may also be appointed Military Commissioner, with full power to correct abuses which are totally neglected by the Civil Authorities, and which if permitted to increase will eventually lead to serious results. 2d The liklihood of full and complete justice being given to freedmen in cases where they are interested against whites is hopeful in Rockingham County but the indications in Shenandoah County are such as to leave no room for hope, unless a radical change takes place in the community, and a more determined effort is made by the officers of the law to execute their duties with fidelity. 3d The Register of Marriages is completed, and each of the four paragraphs contained in Circular 11 series of 1866 are believed to be fully carried out. 4th The County authorities have ample provision for caring for their own indigent poor, and freedpeople are received and treated as are the White inmates. Outdoor relief, where the necessities of the case require is also given. 5th The demand for labor is greater than the supply except at Harrisonburg. Many families could find employment in both Counties at about $10 per month. 6th The schools at Harrisonburgh and Woodstock which are now closed, were in excellent condition, well attended and well conducted, with the advancement as progression and rapid as could be expected. Edinburg, Mt. Jackson, Strasburg & New Market in Shenandoah County require schools, but nothing can be expected from the people towards their establishment or support. Fourth Division comprising the counties of Augusta & Highland. 1st The affairs of the freedpeople in this division indicate that steady advancement is gradually being made by this class. They are all employed at reasonable wages, are generally industrious, and show that they are disposed to make themselves a thrifty, self-supporting and law-abiding population. Col. Jordan the officer in charge reports that from the indications, they are losing their interest in political matters, that is so far as allowing political meetings to interfere with their occupations. From conversations, however with many of the people themselves, I find a very lively interest manifested, with an intelligent discrimination as to their interests, and decided convictions as to who are their friends and who are not. I would also remark that their appreciation of the relation they sustain to each other, especially in regard to the marriage relation is assuming a more substantial aspect. It is believed that as far as the general condition of the freedmen is concerned they are prosperous, intelligent and happy nevertheless intemperance and immorality are far too common and no efforts made by the local authorities, to prevent drunkenness or lewdness. 2d In cases where a colored person is a party to the action and especially if the other party is an influential and popular white man prejudice in the lower Court controls both Court and Jury to a much greater extent than do the facts or evidence. In the higher Courts also the statement of a colored man, as compared with that of a white man does not appear to have the same weight. I cannot believe that a colored person could obtain full and complete justice in any of the Courts if the Military Authority was withdrawn. 3d The Register of Marriages is complete for Augusta County. Col. Jordan has not as yet had the time necessary to complete it in Highland County. The first three paragraphs of Circular No. 11 are carried out. The neglect of the Civil Authorities to prevent or punish lewdness or adultery is not calculated to improve the morals of the Freedpeople. But one surname is used. 4t Col. Jordan reports that he is informed the authorities are able, but not willing to provide for their own poor, and that the overseers of the poor take but very little substantial interest in the subject. No complaints however are made and at present the same aid is extended to all regardless of race or color. The authorized appropriation for this purpose in Augusta County is $5000 and in Highland County $1000 - which would seem to be ample. There are now a number of both races, who because of old age or helplessness are receiving aid, in both Counties, both in and out of the poorhouses. 5t The demand for labor is greater than the Supply and all who are disposed to work are employed at reasonable wages. 6t As in the other divisions of the Sub District the Schools are now closed. The interest of the freedpeople in them is unabated and proportionate to their circumstances. Mount Crawford and Mount Sidney in Augusta County and Monterey in Highland County are favorable locations for the establishment of schools, but little or no assistance could be expected from the inhabitants towards their support. On the tour of inspection, reports of the freedpeople were everywhere encouraging. They are generally sober, industrious and peacable. They are strictly observant of the law; have firm and abiding interest in religion and education, show a commendable spirit and an intelligent appreciation on all public questions which are calculated to affect their prosperity as a race, and are surely and steadily progressing to that scale of manhood which will command for them equality before the law, and eventually the respect of even their enemies. The relations existing between themselves and the white race, up to the middle of May was hopeful. Numerous outrages since that time have been committed against colored people, which the law has dealt with so leniently, as would seem to invite future aggressions. A well grounded appeal taken before the Military Commissioner at Winchester has been production of no good, and the freedpeople (with the exception of the mockery of a trial) are defenceless against the assaults of white persons. Education the freedman\\'s anchor of hope is embraced with fervancy and its power will shortly have a telling effect. By it they are gaining that confidence in themselves which will elevate them above the dependence upon the white man, which slavery taught them was indispensible to their very existence. Freedmen\\'s schools now dot the land in this Sub Dist. like village churches, and are at least as well attended. Every village also has its sabbath school, with an attendance of from ten upwards. At the several stations the official records and papers were in a satisfactory condition and except in one case, no complaints were made against the officers. The continuance of the Bureau for one year longer is a source of rejoicing to the freedpeople as well as their friends, and as far as I can judge, its practical workings has given general satisfaction.',\n",

The day is spent & now, after retiring to my room, I must write you a few lines, though I have not heard from you for some time, owing to my scouting propensities of late, and not being much in camp -- I have been spending two days on the memorable Kernstown battle field, mapping it & the vicinity. It was the first real battle field of The Valley, and, therefore, aside from its other memories, it has a peculiar interest to the dwellers between the mountains. I traced with sad interest the wondrous line of march of one regiment that regarded not the fire of artillery, but went on to its post of duty, and the position of another that met & repulsed the pursuing foe & by one dreadful volley sent a hundred of them to eternity and let but one of its own brave lads accompany them to the judgement bar to tell why it had thus sent them there I gazed long upon the bloody ground where the fight raged so hotly for the possession of the stonewall & where at least 500 Yankees poured out their life's blood for no good reason but a vain effort to subdue us -- but I hope to be able to show you the finished map and tell you of the incidents I have heard from many mouths -- It has been cold and rainy and I have not had a very pleasant time, but I have been well housed at night & well fed and therefore have been better off than many of my companions in arms -- and as I am very thankful to the God of all goodness and grace that his care has been such for one -- I today saw a gentleman from [unclear: Moorefield], an uncle of the Moslin boys, he says they are well, have been working on the farm at home -- Mr. Moslin stays on the farm nearer the Valley as he wishes, to have a good start if the Yankees get after him as he is a cripple -- The paroled Rich Mt. men of Hardy are now gathered at McDowell under the command of Capt [unclear: Momare] Imboden wants to get them for his force -- he has done good service -- he made a dash and destroyed a R.R. bridge a few days ago & burned many stores, capturing some prisioners, the Yankees got after his wagons, led by a union man, and took them while he was gone, burning two, but he retook the others.

       " 'p038_014': 'In compliance with Circular No VI from HeadQuarters Asst Comr B of R.F. & A.L. Richmond Va Jany 29th 1866 I have the honor to submit the following \"Report\" showing the condition of Freedmen\\'s affairs in my Division at this date. The Freedmen are generally employed at fair wages and appear to be contented and have no difficulty in obtaining employment the demand for laborers being far in excess of the supply and every inducement is offered not only in honorable steady employment but at fair and remunerative wages and I am grateful to be able to state that close observation on my part has resulted in the conviction that every colored man in my field of operations who is inclined to labor is taking advantage of the opportunities offered him and is doing as well if not better than the laboring class of whites are here. The policy persisted on by me of having their difficulties adjudicated in my office has had an excellent effect and has in no little degree contributed to the promotion of more kindly feeling between the races. Intemperance does not prevail to any great extent among this class in fact since my assignment to duty at this post I have seen but two colored person under the influence of liquor and those were both from the country and happened here during one of the Circus Exhibitions. The Schools have all been temporarily closed but it is expected they will be re-opened about the 1st of Sept. The Crops are turning out splendidly - demonstrating clearly the fact that the Agricultural interests of this portion of the country have been advanced by the change in the labor system. I am still of the opinion that the necessity for the continuance of the Bureau still exists and although there are a few men here who under existing circumstances claim to be the colored mans friend &c yet I am convinced that much of the kind feeling cherished toward the race by these people is attributable to the moral effect of the presence of Government officers [unclear: Withdraw] the Bureau which now is the counselor & protector of the Freedmen and it would not be long before his condition would be as deplorable, if not more so than when he was in Slavery. It cannot be successfully concealed that there is still cherished a most bitter feeling against the colored man on the part of his old masters and as they have no other means or source through which to vent their spleen against the Federal Govt the presumption naturally arises that were the old slave owners at liberty to carry out their inclinations the colored man (in view of the white mans hatred of the Government and the negro) would have a serious time of it. This is evident from the enthusiasm at the nomination of of Seymour & Blair. Not because of any particular admiration they have for these candidates or any special love they cherish for the democratic party but simply & only by reason of the fact that the Republican party is the friend of the colored race, and the supporter and defender of the Federal Govt. So strong is this conviction fixed in my mind that I believe the mass of the Southern whites would indentify themselves with any party or any people if by doing so they could destroy the Republic and thus accomplish by chicanery or political villainry what they failed to consummate by the sword.',\n",

I am always glad to hear from you but I am particularly glad to learn of your matrimonial prospects progressing to a sweet and happy fruition. I should most heartily second your good wishes and advice to myself upon the same subject but for insuperable difficulties that lie in my way at the present time. The one is that I have no lady \"courted\" like yourself and another difficulty with me just at this time is that the unnatural and detestable war will have to be fought through before I can allow my cranium to be besieged with connubial thoughts. If you are already married please allow your humble and more unfortunate cousin and correspondent to wish you many good things which I shall not attempt to specify as well as take considerable pleasure to himself in knowing that he has one more cousin whom he has never seen. I am sorry, Cous. James, to inform you that we have the enemy so near us at the present time that nearly all our enjoyments are marred. The nearest that they have been was at Mt Crawford on Friday of last week. Some four or five hundred of Yankee cavalry were there that day and all that prevented them from coming farther up the road was the inpracticability of fording the river which has been quite flush for a week or more past, owing to the excessive rains and snow yet remaining in the mountains. The two bridges at Mt Crawford and the one at Bridgewater, by order of General Jackson, were burned on the Tuesday (22nd) preceding. Gen Jackson at present has his army not far from McGaheysville. Bro. John belongs to that division of the army. Bro. Albert belongs to Gen. Joseph E. Johnson\\'s army at Yorktown. Gen. B. Johnson\\'s army -- the division to which your brother Daniel is attached is at present located at the village of West View in this county about six miles S.W. of Staunton. So you see the Conf. territory of the Valley at present is pretty small. The people are a good deal excited and there is no business enterprise scarcely in the whole county. There has been so much rain this Spring that farmers have been scarcely able to plow their ground and as yet I know not of an acre of ground planted in corn in this whole county. Should the season be farmable from this time out I think that there will be nothing like half the usual amt. of corn planted. The wheat is as promising as could be wished and there will be a bountiful harvest from present prospects, particularly if it becomes a little dry during the month of May. I leave for the army in a day or two. I have joined an Artillery Company and will meet my Company in Richmond. We have no regular Mail now nearer than Staunton. The mail at Mt Sidney is exchanged occasionally by persons passing backwards and forwards. I tell you we are in a smart hubbub - in a pretty bad \"old fix\", just now in the Valley. I hope and pray that our arms may be successful at Yorktown. That battle when ever it does come off I think will decide the fate of the Valley indeed of Richmond and of entire Va and if we are successful I think will be the decisive one of the war. A great deal of the live stock of the Valley has been run across the mountains into E Va in the last two weeks or more. I am afraid that we will not be able to recover from the effects of this destructive war for a long time. Religious, moral and educational institutions are at a very low ebb and it will take us a long time to catch up again. I am afraid that my perspected scheme for life will be spoiled even should I be spared through the war.

       " 'p041_000': \"In compliance with Circular No 5 Series of 1864, from Head Quars Assistant Commissioner, Virginia; I have the honor to render the following report of the condition of Freedmen's Affairs in the Ninth Sub District, comprising the counties of Frederick, Clarke, Warren, Page, Shenandoah, Rockingham, Augusta, and Highland, for the quarter ending December 31, 1868. First Division comprising Frederick County. 1st The Freedmen as a general class continue to improve socially and morally. They are rapidly becoming aware of the importance of self-dependence and the value of time; and consequently idleness is disappearing and a healthy [unclear: toned] system of daily labor is effecting a comparative independence, which promises permanent good. A demand for labor during the summer and fall gave constant employment to all who wished to avail themselves of reasonable compensation and many have earned and invested their little surplus earnings in a house for the future. Not a single complaint of violation of contracts has been made against the Freedmen, while a large number have been made against the Whites. In contracts for labor on shares of the crop, many advantages are taken by land-owners, frequently where the Freedmen contract to receive one half or one third of the wheat or corn crop, at the time of settlement they receive their part of the grain, but are defrauded out of their just and valuable portion of the straw or fodder. Still in other cases where employed by the month, legal measures have too often to be resorted to, in order to compel a settlement. Until men are activated by a sense of Justice towards the Freedmen this wrong will continue. Considerable difficulty was experienced in procuring a building for school purposes in Winchester. No White man having suitable buildings would let them for that purpose, and this may be regarded as an evidence of the feeling toward the education of the colored people. Although no encouragement has been given, nevertheless, the schools have prospered, and in many cases a marked degree of proficiency has been attained. It is believed now that the schools in existence will compare favorably with any others of similar grade in this County. It is very generally conceded, even by the enemies of the Freedmen that the children of the latter are acquiring an education as rapidly as the children of the middle and lower class of whites, so that when the rising generation shall aim at manhoods estate they will be sufficiently advanced to detect and prevent the annoyances to which their fathers are subjected. 2d At present it does not appear likely that full and complete justice will be given to Freedmen in cases where they are interested against whites. Although their evidence is admitted, it is not received with that credit which a white mans would in like cases. Especially in jury trials, local prejudices are so strong that it makes a great difference as to the result whether the complainant is a white or colored man. Cases sustaining the opinion herein expressed have heretofore been reported to the Asst Commissioner. 3d The Register of Marriages for this Division is believed to be complete - no additions have been made to it within the past year. Par. 1 of Cir. 11 dated Head Quarters Asst. Comr State of Virginia, Richmond March 19th 1866, is believed to be fully carried out, according to the best information obtained from parties interested. Par. 2 has been frequently read and explained at all the religious meetings of the colored people in the district, and is believed to be thoroughly understood. Par. 3. The state authorities take no action for the prevention of lewdness or adultery among the colored people. The agent would willingly co-operate with them if they would take any action in the [unclear: premises]. As it is, we endeavor to do all we can to discountenance and discourage such practices. Licenses are required for all proposed marriages since Jany 24th 1866. Par. 4 is fully carried out. 4th The County authorities manifest a disposition to provide for their own indigent Freedpeople as they do for Whites, and the means at their disposal is ample for the present demand. Pecuniary embarrassment probably prevents more comfortable quarters being furnished the inmates of the Poorhouse as the buildings are sadly out of repair. 5th The supply of labor in the summer months is not equal to the demand, but in the latter part of the fall and winter it is in excess. Wages range from seven to twelve dollars per month, according to the quality of the help. In a large number of cases the Freedpeople experience great difficulty in obtaining pay for services rendered. An evident intention on the part of many employers to take advantage of their ignorance, and by fraud in accounts and otherwise cheat them on settlements, is often manifest. 6th Miss Lizzie A. Linchcome in charge of school at colored M.E. Church at Winchester is fully qualified to teach, but lacks the ability to govern. Her school is deficient in part of discipline. The school sustained partly by the Bureau in charge of Mr. Oscar M. Waring promises to be a success in numbers and efficiency. Mr. Waring has had several years experience as a teacher, and his school is creditable not only to himself, but to its patrons also. As soon as a teacher can be procured, a school will also be opened at Newtown, which with those here will be ample to meet the necessities of the people in this county. Second Division comprising Clarke, Warren and Page Counties. 1st The Freedpeople appear to be in a prosperous condition in the Counties comprising this division. No great number being in any one place, labor is equally distributed, and all who were able to work are employed. In Clarke County the colored people are erecting a church at an estimated cost of $3000. It is probable however, that before completing it, they will be compelled to appeal to charitable friends for assistance. Warren and Page Counties are equally prosperous with Clarke, but for the reason that no large number can be found together it is considered inexpedient to organize schools at other than those places where schools are now in operation, viz: Berryville, Clarke, Co. Front Royal, Warren Co. and Luray, Page County. Although the people are constantly employed and labor is abundant, there does not seem to be that disposition on the part of the people to acquire property or homes for themselves that is manifested by the Freedmen in the First division. No suffering exists, and the demand on the Counties, by indigent freedpeople, if any are very few. 2d For some months past, no cases of injustice to Freedpeople were reported, but so long as local prejudices exist, full and complete justice will not be given by juries. A much larger amount of evidence than would be required to sustain the the cause of a white man, would alone establish facts in his case, and complaints made by them do not receive equal attention as if made by a white. 3d The Register of Marriages is complete for each County. Par. 2 of Cir. 11 series of 1866 has been fully explained to the Freedpeople in each County by Capt. Ripley the officer in charge, and is stated to be well understood. Par. 3 as in the first division, the civil authorities do nothing to prevent lewdness or adultery. The people however, have been cautioned against such practices. Licenses for marraiges subsequent to Jany 24th 1866 are required. Par. 4 is carried out. 4th In each County, indigent Freedpeople are provided for by the authorities as are the same class of whites. From superstitous causes the most indigent are unwilling to avail themselves of the privileges of the Poorhouses, and consequently few if any seek relief from that source. 5th The demand for labor in each County is greater than the supply for nine months in the year and about balanced for the remainder. Wages range from ($7) seven to ($12) twelve dollars per month, which is generally paid in produce, clothing, &c. As the most exhorbitant prices are demanded for articles thus given, it cuts the wages down to a cash value of at least two dollars per month less than the above quotation. 6th The condition of the school at Berryville in charge of Miss Sarah S. Jackson has attained a fair degree of discipline, and the proficiency of the pupils is of the average in primary schools in Country districts. At Front Royal the school in charge of Miss Mary E. Perry is well conducted and promises to be profitable. The school at Luray would be much improved if a more competent teacher was in charge. Revd Mr. Jones although an excellent man is not qualified for the work, as not being master of words of one syllable himself, and therefore unfit to instruct others. Captain Ripley, the officer in charge has done all in his power to promote the interests of the Freedpeople in his Division. Third Division, comprising the Counties of Shenandoah and Rockingham. Except at Harrinsonburg and Woodstock, the colored people are well distributed in this division, and constant employment is obtained without difficulty the greater part of the year. The people however are very poor, and appear less ambitious than elsewhere. Seldom obtaining cash for labor, they depend on employers to furnish the necessities of life for their families, forgetting that when a settlement comes, they will have to pay the highest store prices for what they had. Except also at the first mentioned place, they appear to have but little interest in education. They would attend schools if furnished them without the expense of Rooms, Teachers, or fare, but no great importance seems to be attached to gaining knowledge through the slow progress of books. The advancement of those who live remote from large towns or settlements, and in the mountains is extremely slow. Few contracts for the coming year have been made. 2d Reports from the officer in charge indicate that full and complete justice is given to Freedmen in cases where they are interested against white men. This is probably so as far as the courts are concerned, but in trials by Jury it is certain that mens prejudices operate against the Freedmen especially in cases of assault, or in the settlement of accounts. Mr James has reported one or two cases where it was evident the juries did not regard the evidence. 3d The Register of Marriages is complete. No additions have been made to it for some months. Par. 2 Is understood, it having been explained to the people at all the religious meetings in the division. Par. 3 Although the authorities take no action for the prevention of lewdness and adultery, few cases are known to exist. The officer in charge does all in his power to prevent such practices. Par. 4 is carried out. 4th Indigent freedpeople are provided for by the authorities of the County, and the means adequate. Few colored people will consent to become inmates of the Poorhouse. 5th The supply of labor is greater than the demand, except at the dullest season. Even at present all are employed who are able to work. 6th But one school is yet in operation, it is located at Harrisonburg, in charge of Miss Elizabeth James, a lady fully competent and devoted to the work. A healthy interest, and a very fair degree of proficiency on the part of the pupils indicate the success of Miss James' efforts. Schools will also be commenced as rapidly as teachers can be secured, at Woodstock, Strasburg and New Market. Since Mr. James has been assigned to this Division, an improved state of feeling has existed between the white and colored people. Fourth Division, comprising the Counties of Augusta and Highland. 1st In this Division the [unclear: general] of the freedpeople has not perceptibly improved. As in other cases, they are defrauded by many employers, who with pretended words of friendship, bind them by contracts which are unjust in many particulars. Numerous complaints have been made to Mr. Waldo, the agent in charge, by Freedmen, against parties for whom they have labored, on contracts and by the month, to the effect that they cannot obtain their pay. In settling such claims, the evident intention, in very many cases, to defraud the laborer, becomes manifest, and many freedmen suffer in consequence. Intemperance is happily decreasing. Labor is in active demand and the Schools will do much to enlighten and instruct the people in their rights, and the manner in which to obtain them. 2d Until past prejudices are [unclear: removed], and loyal men occupy the positions of Magistrates, Sheriffs & Juries, full and complete justice cannot be expected for the Freedmen. 3d The Marriage Register is complete, and each of the four Paragraphs have been carried out as far as practicable. The County Authorities do nothing for the prevention of lewdness. 4th Ample arrangements have been made by the County Authorities for the care of their own indigent freedpeople, the means at their disposal is sufficient for all purposes. 5th Labor is in good demand, even at this late season all who can work find employment without difficulty at from eight to twelve dollars per month. In Highland and a large portion of Augusta Counties, very little money is paid the laborer, who is content with such commodities as he can use in his family, obtained at prices in advance of what the same goods could be purchased at the Stores. By this system, employers take back the whole of the employees wages, and still have a balance in their favor, and the Freedman is compelled to work on trying to liquidate the debt, and getting deeper into it the longer he works. 6th The schools at Staunton, although recently opened are doing well. Mr John Scott has a flourishing and well regulated school with a remarkably large average attendance and a [unclear: corresponding] degree of interest. Revd Jackson Strange also has a good and orderly school. The attendance however is not so large, nor the discipline scarcely so good as at the school of Mr. Scott. There are two other smaller schools in Augusta County, which was impracticable to visit. Mr. Waldo the agent in charge is an efficient and faithful officer, and has discharged his duties to the satisfaction of this office and the Freedpeople of his division. With low wages and large families, many working men, even with good health, find it difficult to maintain their families and furnish clothing. The advantage which employers take of ignorant freedmen, the manner in which they defraud them of their pay, knowing that they cannot resort to law for want of means to employ counsel - the advantage taken in drawing up and explaining to the Freedpeople contracts which bind them to labor for a whole year for a trifling portion of the crop all point with gloomy certainty to the fact that after restrictions are removed the colored people will be again reduced to servitude for a compensation of the coarsest food and clothing. It is also a matter of regret that the better class of the community, as well as the civil authorities take no heed of the looseness in morals by which they are surrounded. Outside of the Bureau, no efforts appear to have been made to correct this evil. Although perhaps not quite so bad as formerly, still it exists to a much greater extent than would be tolerated in any well regulated community. In conducting a service of nearly three years in the Bureau, we desire to acknowledge and thank the Asst Comr for the uniform courtesy and kindness which has marked his official relations with this office, ever ready to advance the interests of those for whom he labored, he has given [unclear: permanency] to the Schools throughout the Valley, encouraged temperance and protected labor, thereby placing the Freedmen on the surest and safest road to intelligence, health, and independence and true happiness.\",\n",

Your letter breathes of sympathy that is cheering. The boxes containing the books and lamps are expected tonight and nothing can be more welcome than the latter. I have taken up a contribution for lights and fuel and established the practice as weekly. Dec 19th The boxes have arrived, and although I have not opened them, yet I expect to, and must put up the lamps ready for night school.  I have had the pleasure of teaching by a fire today for the first time as we had no stove for my room and I have suffered heretofore.  I rode out, Saturday last and procured an old Rebel Camp stove which now warms [unclear: us] and is in better business than it ever was before. The appearance of the country is desolate but the desolation is not departed glory, for it never had any, but gives evidence of a most consummate lazy people, as its former owners.  I came in sight of the grand old \"Alleghany\" Mts. They look wild and majestic, I saw a wild deer this morning which was shot yesterday, out in those mountains. We are overworked and could not carry on the schools were it not for the aid we get from a soldier and a young man who is staying in town a few days to buy condemned property, and [unclear: reffuse] stuff to send north.  I hope our other teacher will return from Lexington this week and relieve us, as we sent her up with Supt. Coan last week to start that school til other teachers could arrive.  Mr Tukey has gone to Lexington, and as it is near the holidays he took Mr Johstone up to relieve Mr Coan immediately, as he wishes to go down the valley toward Winchester and visit the schools that way before Christmas, And Mr Johnston can return to this place and thence to Harrisonburg during Christmas week, and with no more expense to the Association than if he went to direct to Harrisonburg, as Mr Tukey takes his own horse.  It seems to be expected that next week is to be a continual holiday. I object to that use of the most sacred day as one of commemoration ever engaged celebrated by man (except that which reminds us of the resurrection of Christ) but suppose I shall have to yield and close school  We think however of trying to aid in geting up a fair to help pay for a School House--These poor people think that they can raise money enough to build a church in a short time, I do not discourage them but they have little idea of the value of property.',\n",

My case and cause are those of thousands and just as I am effected they will be effected also. There is a deep laid organization here that governs and controls every thing by might in defiance of truth and justice. On any, even the least pretense a black man is taken up and imprisoned. His color is his condemnation, and every lawless act committed he is accused of. At present my brethern are living in a reign of terror and many of them are locked up in Stauton Gaol. An act of theft has been committed here by one or two black men and lo! four are taken up and all of us are accused. Some of us had to fly, who were and are as innocent of the crime as you are. The Freedmen's bureau is ineffective, laughed at and despised. On the first Monday of November these men are to be tried, and in view of their case we cannot expect justice unless the strong arm of military protection is reached out to us. We gave to the rich white man our best years, our strength, our youth, our sweat, and now that we are free, we get in return meaness, tyranny and injustice. And now General, instruct the officers of Bureau and let them insist on justice. Some of our men are in a state of perpetual terror. If you turn your back on us, who can we appeal to. If we have commited a violation of law let us be judged impartially by the laws, but let us not be condemned with out a cause. From this depth of degredation we look to you, and in the name of suffering humanity, I trust I do not write in vain. The name of those imprisoned are Reuben Hill, James Burgy, Joe Wilson is out as State evidence, and mind you a black man's oath before the war would not be believed and now they would degrade him to be a liar.

But I have an opportunity to send a letter North by a gentleman who has been working here for some time, but is going home, & I sincerely hope he may be permitted to mail this letter to you. Dear Mollie, there has been many sad changes since last I wrote you, my heart aches as I think of them, but I try to submit without murmuring, for I can not but feel that it is the Lord\\'s will, that our once prosperous & happy nation must be divided; and where peace & happiness, once Shed their smile to gladen the hearts of the people, now civil war is devastating our land. It is very sad to think of, but you know, dear cousin, as well, perhaps better than I do, the state of our beloved country. But do not let us despair, we are in the hands of a merciful God, & he will surely work all things to-gether for our good, & his own glory. His ways are mysterious. I suppose, dear Mollie, that you have not heard from Cousin Will since the war commenced. He is in Virginia, at Norfolk, a city about two hundred miles from here, I have not heard from him for some time, the last I heard of him, he was well.There has been no fighting where he is yet, & I hope there will be none. I wish I could see him, nothing would afford me more happiness. He has promised to come as soon as he can. I know where Will is, and can hear from him some time; But where is cousin Tom? Oh! how unhappy I have been a bout him since I received his last letter, which was in May. If I could feel sure of his safety I would be so happy. I know where ever he is, & in what ever circumstance he may be placed, there is One who ever watches over him, when human friends are of no avail I have looked at his picture many, many times, since I heard from him, and read his letters again & again, while tears of anguish flowed from my eyes, as I thought of the probbability of never hearing from you all again. But I hope, dear Mary that there is a brighter day ahead, & the time may soon come when our correspondence will recommence not to be stopped by any national calamity. I wish you had sent me your picture I hope some day to see it, & not your shadow merely, but your own dear self. What a happy day that would be! Tell dear Aunt not to be unhappy because Cousins Will & Tom are in opposite parties. Tell her, cousin Mollie, that I would try to console her but I know not how. I can only pray for her Her situation is one of peculair Sadness, & I would that it were in my power to administer to her consolation, but I can not I am too weak & ignorant, I fear, to comfort her, but I pray the Lord my console her in her affliction. He is able & willing to comfort her. There has been some changes in our family since last I wrote. Sister was married the Fourth of July. She married Mr. Williams I beleive I wrote some thing about him to you or cousin Tom. He would say, \"she did remarkably well.\" He is not very wealthy, but he is an honest & industrious man, esteemed by all. I know they would send you some message or perhaps write, if they had know that I intended to write to you, but I did not know it myself until nearly eleven o\\'clock to-night, & as their home is some distance from mine I could not go to see them. I will send their love to you (all) any how. Unfortunately mother is away from home to-night also. Give her love to Auntie & tell that she often talks about her. I must stop for it is getting late, & I am a fraid I will not wake in time to send this down. Excuse me, dearest Cousin, I intended to write you a long letter, but time will not permit it now. Give my love to Cousin Tom, and tell I often think of him & long for the time when he can write to me again, I miss his and your letters more than I do any of my other correspondence I would give any thing to receive one of your\\'s or his\\' long & interesting letters. Remember, dear Mary, if I should never hear from you again, I shall ever feel the tenderest affection for you, & deepest solicitude for your happiness. All send much love, Do not forget to give my love & a kiss to your youngest brother. If it is in your power, dear Mollie, write to me. A letter from you would give me more happiness than I could express. You wrote to me once a bout being a Christain. Do you still love Christ & his cause? Are you striving to please him? You have my prayers in your behalf. Good bye dearest Mary, if- if I never hear from or see you while living, I hope to meet you with the redeemed & blessed above.

I do not get time to read the news or write many letters to my friends. The church when we came into it had no seats, no writing desks, no pulpit no windows on one side of the house, and no fence around it, My saw and hammer have supplied the deficiency so far, and I have more to do. There is not one colored carpenter in town and he can not be had to work for nothing and there is no money to pay him, much less a white man This work with that of giving counsel in thousands of instances in business matters--writing notes, Contracts, Orders,  etc.--managing the S School and visiting the sick and infirm, and all in addition to teaching and looking after the general interest of the schools, is  laborious. We still labor under two difficulties, Want of Room and Time. Four schools in one small building either obliges us to conduct our exercises in a subdued manner or else confuse each other, We choose the former; but can not excit that interest and energy in our pupils that we might were it not for fear of disturbing each other, and we often have to change seats for the sake of accommodating classes who have not room to sit for a particular exercise, this makes some confusion, and takes a little time. One of our teachers had to crawl out onto a bench to get at her class to hear it recite as there is no room for either her or the class to stand with convenience  there is there is no way of getting there not with out much trouble. The evenings are growing short and our studies  increasing in numbers thus cramping us for time. I think next month we shall try two sessions per day, and one at night if we can stand it.

Saturday evening six girls and six gentlemen left here to take a ride. I was in the party and we almost froze to death we had to get off at some person's house & warm ourselves. When Sandy came home he told a tale about Ashers coming home I went down to the cars two evenings in succession to meet him. The second evening we met Cousin Will who had come up from Richmond and he said that he had been down to see the boys and they were expecting a fight so he advised Asher to stay until it was over. He has the furlough though and can come home when he wants to. It is so terribly cold today. I wonder if you are warm enough. Has Fred returned to camp yet. rather has he reached there.

The freedmen have however a vague dread of being soon deprived of the assistance now given by this Bureau, and are thus repressed in their aspirations for manhood through fears of being left at the mercy of implacable neighbors, who now secretly vaunt the terrible things they will do when \"the yankees\" and (with undescribable sneers) the \"Freedmens Bureau\" are gone.

Partial issues of rations prevents starvation but wood is also needed to defend them from the cold.

Shortly after receiving your letter of the 25th March, I joined the 1st Reg. Cavalry and was detailed at once at Genl. Stuart's Hd.Qrs. in the Quartermaster's Department of which Major Fitzhugh, former Adjutant Genl. of Gen. Stuart is now chief. And since have been actively engaged in purchasing horses &c. I was just contemplating a trip to Warren with a view of getting to Clarke when the Enemy crossed the Rappahannock and drove us from Culpeper. I need not give you any details of the late military operation further than to say that the Enemy's Cavalry have gotten between this point and Richmond cut the R.Road at Louisa  and other points below, penetrated to James River, and are running wild over This Country Plundering and robbing -- unfortunately we have but one brigade of Cavalry, a few infantry, and two Batteries here, Genl. Stuart being somewhere below towards Fredericksburg. And the force is by no means sufficient to oppose the Enemy, as they have some 14000 Cavalry. However Gen. Lee has gained a glorious victory at Fredericksburg, driven the Enemy across the Rappahannock, and Their Cavalry must leave at once if they can. I am waiting here until the way is open I have not heard from Jim since I left him some two weeks ago - Nor have I heard from Richmond-  I am hoping my dear wife from day to day that the tide of war may bring me nearer to you, and enable me to see you once more, but now that I am regularly enlisted in the Army again I have no freedom of action, and must bear and endure with what patience and fortitude I can command.

       " 'p004_027': 'I have noticed & read with much interest, My dear Sir, your articles in the Whig, and I have been gratified to observe the favor with which your proposition has been responded to in the State. I have taken some pains to impress the minds of several influential men as to the importance of holding the convention & of inaugurating, & thoroughly organizing the \"Opposition Party\" in Va, & the South. I spoke to I. S. Gallagher and his br of Charleston Free Press, before your first article appeared, & got them [unclear: unlisted]. They have barbed you up zealously. There is a good article in the Whig of the 11th yesterday, which sounds like your voice. I hope you will have an address prepared, & I shall then be sure it will be just right: sound, moderate, conservative, conciliatory. You are right when you say \"we must be content to stand where our fathers stood\". That is the only safe ground we can stand on. The course taken by Goggin & Bell, of Ky in their canvasses, has hurt us very much, not only with conservative men at the North, but by creating a schism among ourselves. I can never subscribe to the doctrine that Congress must protect slavery in the Territories; never. We must repudiate that vagary. The democratic Party at the South has run upon a rock upon which they must split the African Slave trade. I am glad to see Phillips, late of Ala, & Reuben Davies M. C. of Miss, coming out against it. Wise, like a man detected in a conspiracy to set fire to a building, has the hardihood to acknowledge his complicity, but rails and bellows in the most furious manner against the rascality of treachery, & the publication of a private letter! He is like a pheasant that makes a great flutter till her chickens have all hid, & then flies away. I have seen \"Hancock\". His purpose is made apparent. What would the South say to Foot of Vt.? If the North object to Bates, Bell, Crittenden, Reves &c, suppose Va. shd. offer, in a spirit of magnanimity & compromise, to take Foot--a nominal republican, but a truly conservative man? I throw out this idea for you to turn over and reflect upon. The North couldn\\'t object to him, & the South wd. be safe with him. But he must be better known to some of the \"controlling spirits\" of the South, before they would agree to this. I do not think Fillmore could be run with any chance of success, such is the bitter & inappeaseable hostility to him on the part of the republicans; hence I mention Foot. I hope you will find your farming and distilling operations pecuniarily successful. I shall be most happy to drink your health in your own \"old Wheat\" whenever you may afford me an opportunity.

Ned, and says in one paragraph \"The vicinity in which you are gave me a very pleasant home for a year or two, and it seems like losing old friends (I spell losing as she does--who has been a teacher all her life) to hear of devastation going on there. I wish I could know if McCue, Sibert, Van Lear, Hoover, Baylor and a long list more are names in arms to oppose our troops &c\" In another she says \"George has just come in to tea & says give my respect to the soldier and tell him to get me some  buttons. He is making a collection of the various kinds of buttons ancient & modern &c.\" I doubt not her interesting relative has had good chance to collect or will have good chances--as I doubt not he is one of the prisoners taken by our men, as almost all the Vermont Cavalry was taken, and are to day being made to cross the unbridged & swollen run at Mt. Crawford on their march to Staunton from which place he will be sent somewhere South via Lynchburg. I intend to answer Miss Pillsberry letter and send it to Harrisonburg, in the hope if the enemy will come so far--that it can be mailed there--and she will get it--and I guess the reply will be one somewhat different from what she anticipated.

I would like to know all about it, as I do not feel like sustaining this loss.

I have felt so badly about the manufacture that I had not  to go to the nitre bureau when I was in Richmond as I had no information before--I could communicate, and have felt so much mortified at our failure as I regard it, that I did not want to see them--Instead of our ability to send in a few thousand pounds as I had hoped--to pay off our indebtedness first, to find  & 30 pounds going into the hands of the agent--to draw the pittance necessary to eke out a miserable existence at the establishment--was more than I had the face to stand.

McCue of Spottsylvania, bro\\' of Mattie, detailed to superintend the manufacture here--if I can--a place to [unclear: pay] in starting--but he is unacquainted with the business--and is an energetic, concientious bussiness man--accustomed to manage hands successfully on rail roads, and can do so, elsewhere--a pious, correct man of few words--I will bring or send him to you to get some familiarity with the process & if another cave can be found that will pay in that quarter and his services will not be needed at the cave you are at he can find employment elsewhere.

The rapid advance of the enemy now in rear of Genl Jackson makes the future here--quite uncertain--I scarcely know what plan to fix--in regard to leaving home--So  if we should fail at Richmond as we may do and as we have done at Nashville, New Orleans & elsewhere--\\'tis impossible to speak of the future.

I left camp on the 24th thare had been but very little Infantry fighting but some heavy cannonnading across the river the enimy seemed to have the advantage in position at evry ford. We have a very large Army in Culpepper for Pope to contend with. Your Brother John was well when I left the Com. thay ware all in good spirits when I left. I met Jacob, Abe, & Isack Vines on Monday. Jacob gave me a half Cheese. Abe told me he had something to tell me how he had fooled you out of some secrets. I be glad to se him & find out what thay are. I seen John Plunkett in Gordonsville he told me that Charles had a letter for me I am sorry I did not meet him as he is so careless he may loose it before I get back this is a very mean hospital. Very little accommodations, nothing but bread & meat to eat & my throat being soar it is very hard to swallow. I wish I could come home and let Churchman tend on me a while evry thing is very dear around hear & thare is but little change in the circulation. I have been trying to get a note Broke ever since I left the Regt. This is a very lonesome blase. Thare is nothing of importance to write I hope these fiew lines may find you enjoying both health & happiness. I pray the God of mercies may soon visit me with health.',\n",
       " 'p042_025': 'I am sorry that I am not at home today to congratulate you upon the anniversary of your birth day and to wish you many happy returns of the same -- I hope your \"ills\" have all left you and that you have had a pleasant day and that the little family circle has been in a cheery mood - - group I should say, not circle, for I fear that I am a disjointed and lone fragment of something that is inclomplete without my portion and my fragment is a waif without the rest -- and now, when I wish I were there, but know that I cannot be, the sense of loneliness that follows almost provokes to tears -- I have been thinking how you all look & what you are all doing tonight -- how I think you have all retired -- you keep better hours when I am away -- but I think I had the picture as it was an hour ago -- only I dont whether Anne played \"Shoo Fly\" or \"Capt. Jinks\" at the close of the entertainment -- You all looked over the paper to see if \"Pa\" had any \"notice\" and know what the \"Salons\" are doing at Richmond -- news that we will get at 9 P.M. tomorrow -- I intended to send you a Valentine, but as you could not get it today I thought best to keep it until I come \"a courting\", which will be ere long. I had a letter from Mr. Effinger, dated the 10 th  -- I only conclude you are well from a P.S. which says \"I met your daughter on the street yesterda, she was looking very well & as charming as usual\" -- I suppose that was Anne on her way to school. I have been intending to reply to Nelly\\'s excellent letter every day since it came, but I have the pen in my hand so much during the day that I dread to take it up at night -- then I am so deeply interested in some scientific books I get here & that I cannot even see elsewhere, that forget the claims of duty in my desire to get the benefit of treasures I have longed to handle & read from my very boyhood -- Now, My Dear, don\\'t be jealous of the old books -- for though I may go with them to \"dream land\" I am sure to come back to my daylight senses and wish for the \"[unclear: living] epistle\" in my home casket -- I have just been, tonight, to Dr. Sampson\\'s lecture on Palestine, Egypt &c -- it was deeply interesting -- I would have given much if you could all have heard him -- he has been all over \"the lands\" and speaks of what he has seen -- I don\\'t know whan Anne & Stiles would have done if they had heard him tell how the little boys in Egypt climb up by the tails of the buffaloes to get on their backs & he said the buffaloes do not even say \"Shoo fly\"! He had the dresses of the people of Egypt & dressed up as a boy & he looked exactly like the pictures of Arabs in Lynch\\'s Dead Sea -- He spoke of the observations of Herodotus -- saying he was a wonderfully accurate observer & writer (By the way I think Nelly would find a good deal that she would like in that old book -- she will find it in my Bohn series) -- Dr. S. had bits of mummies, images &c -- he lectures two nights more -- he preached last night, at the college chapel on \"sincerity the basis of Christianity\" -- a very fine discourse very suggestive & learned -- Mr. Holland preached or rather lectured to the Cadets Y. M. Christian Assn the Sunday night previous on \"What will he do with it\" -- i.e. the soul, body & spirit given to a young man, what will he do with them -- . This is an interesting feature here - so many able lecturers are brought here & they have so many here that can & do lecture -- But I must stop this garrulity, for I see the bottom of the page -- Gen. Lee says the \"young ladies must come up and spend some time with them\" -- I have had some fun with Allan about a young Alabama widow here -- . The weather continues very warm, too warm -- I am very well -- I hope you have heard from Ma before now -- how is she -- I heard from Ellyson -- they are well -- So far as I know my prospects are tolerably good at Richmond -- I think it now lies between Mr. Ruffner & myself -- if no chance for him I get his vote & vice versa - More anon -- Write to me -- A kiss just here, for birthday ',\n",
